It's a collection of interesting stuff and plot points I found in the book. With that said, lets go.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-During the Emperor's invasion of Luna during the unification era, the High Matriarch of the Selenar entrusts one of her gene-witches to carry off something called the Magna Mater in order to keep it from the Emperor's unworthy hands. The new master of Terra doesn't have the wisdom nor great vision to use its knowledge.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-The space fighting at the Kthonic and Elysian gates was just to spread Imperial fleets across the solar perimeter. The gates are not the only way for Horus to get through to Terra. A Warp rift appeared past the Gates. Big enough for hundreds of ships to pass through straight into Terra's orbit. A mighty flood of traitor ships endlessly poured from the rift their weapons bringing fire to Terra. Geee, embracing Chaos does have its perks, doesn't it?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-During the Unification era, as the Emperor assembled his armies, many of the outer reaches of the Sol system were in xenos hands. Only the bravery of frontier fleets kept Terra safe until the Emperor was ready.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-Despite the Emperor wiping out entire cultures for less affronts, he allowed the Selenar to maintain their religion because he needed their knowledge of gene-craft that outstripped his own and also their industrial scale facilities to build his legions\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-What is the Magna Mater? It's the fountainhead of the earliest and most powerful of the space marine genetics. Basically, the genetic source code for space marines\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-The protagonists of the novel decide to rescue the Magna Mater to save the future. After the HH is done, the Emperor would need fresh legions to safeguard mankind.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-The Emperor concentrated the legion gene-code in the marines beyond the parameters advised by the Selenar. Legion traits are boosted beyond what was intended by the gene-witches. The Emperor always liked to push further than he should\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-The Gene-witches seem to have some weird vibe to them. When the Matriarch said that \\\"it's the nature of mankind to destroy\\\", she put stress on the man part. Also when one of the marines got offended by a comment a gene-witch made, she said that he is fragile and that is a side effect of his hyper aggressive masculine traits. Another thing she said is that the Selenar always underestimated the cruelty of men.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-The Magna Mater was hidden in an underground secret facility that was used once to develop a branch of the Space Marines genetics. It failed and produced nothing but freaks and monsters. The place was shutdown and abandoned. A perfect hiding place aside from the fact that it rested beneath a toxic and radioactive trash dump.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-The duty of the Selenar was to move unseen through the ages in the world of men and make sure that the power of creation did not fall in the hand of men. But the man that calls himself Emperor took that gift from them for his purposes and as expected of men like him he shaped it into a weapon of conquest and destruction. Now instead of a mortal war that burns out in a mortal span, the galaxy is set ablaze. When gods war, everyone burns alongside them.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-The monsters and freaks in the facility weren't all purged. A few remained in their bio-containers. The gene-witch released them to buy time for the heroes to escape. These things are Ur-legionaries. failed experiments but they still extremely physically powerful to the point that they tore apart the Sons of Horus with their malformed limps. They were malformed and heavily mutated with one having multiple faces on its body, the other had what appeared to be steel cabling as sinews and its eyes were akin to a spider's, one had a completely normal face that echoed the face of Horus, but most strangely of all was that one of abominations was ethereally beautiful reminiscent of Fulgrim.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-The heroes of the book, the heroes of the shattered legions all die one and all. Heroic deaths that would have honored their legions, but no one will ever know their names and sacrifices. Though, by their brave actions did they save the future of mankind.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-The line that Alpharius delivered to Sharrowkyn in \\\"The Seventh Serpent\\\" about Magnus wanting him alive finally makes sense. The capital ship of the Thousand Sons appears out of nowhere to cast off the Sons of Horus pursuers and to intercept the heroes ship from escaping. It seem that Magnus had foreseen all of this and plans to use the Magna Mater for his own purpose, to create a fresh legion of his own.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-The heroes ship manages to escape and hide in the derelict unification era coaling station that sheltered at in the start of the novel. All that remains of the heroes are the mortally wounded Sabik Weyland and Sharrowkyn.

A location on the map can be selected within a certain distance of the vehicle, much like artillery, for the unit to move to and occupy. The vehicle becomes immobile for a few seconds while deploying its troops, the time varying on the type of unit. Additionally, the further away from the vehicle the selected location, the longer it takes for the soldiers to reach it and start their task. They will try to take the path that provides the most cover, whether through concealment or places simply unreachable to tanks. However, any infantry unit can easily be killed with MG fire even before they have a chance to reach their destination, so skillful positioning and deployment strategies are needed.\\n\\nThere are several types of infantry units I have come up with so far, varying in SP or SL cost depending on what they are specialized for. For instance, a low cost unit like spotters armed with only light rifles and SMGs, marking targets they see, providing a bonus for spotting, exactly like light tank scouting. They can also provide an effective counter to enemy infantry, preventing the meta from becoming nothing but spam of one AT unit. (Every infantry unit will have like 1 or 2 riflemen or SMGs to defend themselves against enemy infantry, but the scouts would be by far the best anti-personnel option)\\n\\nThere are light AT soldiers, armed with AT grenades or light rockets like Panzerfausts or PIATs, which will dig in at their spot for safety and wait to fire at anything that gets close to their position, doing moderate damage to lightly armored vehicles, but less damage to anything heavily protected. However, to balance this, hull break from their weapons is virtually impossible. Additionally, the accuracy of any unit degrades rapidly at increased range, and it takes time for them to reload, leaving them open to counterattacks of MG fire or a well-placed HE round. (Infantry could also be a great way to get Many Miles Away to stop telling HE to go eat shit)\\n\\nThere are others I\\u2019ve thought of roughly, like slightly harder-hitting mortar units that rain light artillery onto enemies behind cover to flush them out, Mine-layers that find nearby roads near their spot and lay AT mines to destroy enemy tracks, or even repair crews that can move around amongst the team and help repair friendly tanks, and even replenish partially damaged crew. I\\u2019ve even come up with some \\u201cScavenger\\u201d units that can occupy some of the damaged environment pieces, like the field guns on Frozen Pass, and use them as a stationary weapon. Or, if there aren\\u2019t any features like this on the map, they can scavenge the remains of destroyed tanks (Assuming that the carcass despawning is changed), friendly or enemy, for a little bonus in SL and RP gain. And, as a return, the player that had their vehicle scavenged will receive a discount on that unit\\u2019s repair cost, up to maybe like 50%. Yes, even if they\\u2019re enemy. Sometimes it\\u2019s okay to be nice to the players on the other team \\ud83d\\ude0a. Of course, this would be given a moderate cooldown, to prevent people from farming this ability as their only method of grinding, which forces them to still use other units to actually profit, so it\\u2019s not just scavenger spam with no other squads that actually support and help the rest of the team OUTSIDE the hangar.\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s more, APCs could carry a separate type of unit for anti-infantry combat, to help flush out positions occupied by enemy soldiers, and prevent the meta from being nothing but Mortar spam. This can range from the aforementioned scout-riflemen, to a group that sets up a couple stationary MMG\\u2019s for dealing with lots of soldiers, perfect for setting up in a spot where enemy soldiers pass by very often on their way to their destination. These will all have a spotting mechanic (Varying in range, depending on the unit, that way MMG squads aren\\u2019t spotting things before snipers are), so they aren\\u2019t rendered entirely useless outside of their main job.\\n\\nOf course, this could all sound very unbalanced, but there is plenty of weaknesses and risks of infantry use, as well.
