U.S.-made missile defenses are designed primarily to counter ballistic missiles\\u2014launched in a high arc with predictable trajectories\\u2014but have more difficulty stopping cruise missiles, which fly low to the ground where radars struggle to spot them.\\n\\nAs Russia and China invest in long-range cruise missiles for potential future conflicts, the U.S. Defense Department has made improving the military\\u2019s ability to detect and defeat these types of weapons a top priority. But the problem has taken on new urgency amid increased tension with Iran, which has been quietly been building up its own cruise missile capabilities for over a decade.\\n\\nA key piece to solving this problem, commanders say, is beefing up the Pentagon\\u2019s network of spy satellites to better detect and track cruise missiles, drones, and the emerging threat of hypersonic weapons\\u2014missiles that fly at more than five times the speed of sound. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t defend against something that you can\\u2019t see,\\u201d said Gen. John Hyten, now-vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in 2019.\\n\\nTo this end, the newly established Space Development Agency\\u2014which will eventually become part of the new Space Force\\u2014aims to launch several dozen small, low-cost satellites into orbit through 2022, and dozens more every two years after that. A \\u201ctracking\\u201d layer of satellites will track the threat, while a \\u201ctransport\\u201d layer will broadcast that tracking data to traditional missile defense communications networks, said Derek Tournear, the director of the agency, this week at the Pentagon.\\n\\nThe goal is to have \\u201cfull global coverage\\u201d by fiscal year 2026, Tournear said.\\n\\nSince the Cold War era, the U.S. military has built up a vast network of operators, weapons, and sensors dedicated to missile defense. The first part of defeating an incoming missile threat is detecting and tracking it. This is best done from space, where satellites can cover much wider areas than lower-flying reconnaissance assets such as drones and surveillance planes. The final piece is destroying the threat, traditionally achieved by an interceptor fired from a missile defense system.\\n\\nBut countering cruise missiles and small unmanned aerial vehicles is trickier than defeating ballistic missiles. These weapons fly low to the ground at high speeds, and they have unpredictable flight patterns that challenge modern missile defenses. For example, analysis of weapons debris recovered from the Sept. 14 attacks showed that some of the craft, which originated from the north, took a roundabout path to the facility, flying over Iraq and Kuwait.\\n\\nJust as critical as new sensors is a faster way to pass information between operators and the various lethal platforms that will defeat the threat. Many legacy platforms can\\u2019t communicate directly with each other, and any decision requires multiple phone calls or internet chat messages that take up precious minutes.

CrisisFACTS-010-News-94-0,CrisisFACTS-010,just 3 of what the us spends destroying countries could end starvationon the entire planet it was reported this week that the pentagon made 35 trillion  with a t  in accounting adjustments in 2019 alone,"{\"id\": \"wakingtimes--2020-01-24--Just 3% of What the US Spends Destroying Countries Could End Starvation\\u2014On the Entire Planet\", \"date\": \"2020-01-24\", \"source\": \"wakingtimes\", \"title\": \"Just 3% of What the US Spends Destroying Countries Could End Starvation\\u2014On the Entire Planet\", \"content\": \"It was reported this week that the Pentagon made $35 trillion \\u2014 with a \\u2018T\\u2019 \\u2014 in accounting adjustments in 2019 alone. That number is larger than the entire U.S. economy and is up from $30.7 trillion in 2018. The figure also dwarfs the Congressional approved military budget of $738 billion. Naturally, no one cares and Pentagon officials dismiss this black hole of spending as accounting errors.\\n\\nThis problem is only getting worse too. As Bloomberg reported, the Defense Department acknowledged that it failed its first-ever audit in 2018 and then again last year, when it reviewed $2.7 trillion in assets and $2.6 trillion in liabilities. Despite the shame of failing\\u2014twice\\u2014the accounting \\u201cerrors\\u201d have grown.\\n\\nImagine running a company in which you accounted for spending like they do at the Pentagon. If you were the CFO, you\\u2019d be fired, if and only if the entire business didn\\u2019t already collapse. However, because these morons have an unlimited pool of tax revenue and Federal Reserve dollars from which to draw resources, they are allowed to continue down this unaccountable path toward unsustainable debt and spending.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Democrats and Republicans alike remain silent as questioning the military industrial complex is akin to a thought crime. The war machine must go on and continue to expand or else they\\u2019ll find themselves out of a job. The majority of Americans follow the same code of silence when it comes to military spending. Boobus Americanus sits back in his recliner as his grandchildren\\u2019s future is squandered by mass murderers dropping million dollar bombs on people living in tents on the other side of the planet \\u2014 for \\u2018freedom\\u2019 \\u2014 of course.\\n\\nDespite audits and scrutiny from those paying attention, the Pentagon has only continued to lose money by the trillions since 9/11, and a report analyzing the budgets of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) shows that the total is more than $21 trillion.\\n\\nThe report attributes the missing funds to a series of \\u201cunsupported journal voucher adjustments\\u201d made to the departments\\u2019 budgets. These adjustments are not tied to specific accounting transactions, but they are often included in account summaries to cover for balances between systems that cannot be reconciled.\\n\\nAs The Free Thought Project has reported, not only is it likely that the actual amount of money the DoD and HUD cannot account for is much higher than $21 trillion, due to the fact that researchers did not have access to complete data, but the practice of creating counterfeit adjustments appears to be standard procedure.\\n\\n\\u201cPerhaps even more troubling than the total amount lost is the fact that fraudulent behavior from HUD and DOD seem to be the standard operating procedure. In fact, the accounting for these funds is so poor, that as Reuters notes, the Defense Finance and Accounting Services (DFAS) refers to the preparation of the Army\\u2019s year-end statements as \\u2018the grand plug\\u2019 \\u2014 \\u2018plug\\u2019 is accounting jargon for the insertion of made-up numbers. For every transaction, a so-called \\u2018journal voucher\\u2019 that provides serial numbers, transaction dates and the amount of the expenditure is supposed to be produced. The report specifies that the agency has done such a poor job in providing documentation of their transactions, that there is no way to actually know how $21 trillion has been spent.\\u201d\\n\\nThe problem is so bad, that these warmongers have \\u2018lost\\u2019 $58,386 per second since 9/11.\\n\\nThose of us not blinded by the propaganda and false patriotism, see the inevitable results of such a propensity for supporting war. We see domestic infrastructure crumbling, a national debt increasing by record amounts each year, more conflict around the globe, and countless veterans suffering from PTSD. When will it all end? At this pace, it won\\u2019t end until the empire falls.\\n\\nLuckily, there are people waging a campaign to prevent further war and subsequent deficit spending. They are paying to put up billboards showing just how much of your money the US steals to blow up brown people in foreign countries. The group is World Beyond War and their efforts are massive. For the last several years, they\\u2019ve been putting up powerful billboards all over the country. One of them can be seen below.\\n\\nThey back these numbers up with data on their website, pointing out that in 2008, the United Nations said that $30 billion per year could end hunger on earth, as reported in the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and many other outlets. The Food and Agriculture Organization has not updated that figure since 2008, and has recently told us that such figures do not require much updating. In a separate report, most recently published in 2015, the same organization provides a figure of $265 billion as the cost per year for 15 years to permanently eliminate extreme poverty, which would eliminate starvation and malnutrition \\u2014 a broader project than just preventing starvation one year at a time. The FAO\\u2019s spokesperson informed us in an email: \\u201cI think it would be incorrect to compare the two figures as the 265 billion has been calculated taking into consideration a number of initiatives including social protection cash transfers aimed at extracting people from extreme poverty and not just hunger.\\u201d\\n\\nAs of 2019, the annual Pentagon base budget, plus war budget, plus nuclear weapons in the Department of Energy, plus Homeland Security and other military spending totaled well over $1 trillion \\u2014 not counting what\\u2019s \\u201clost.\\u201d\\n\\nSo, 3% of U.S. military spending could end starvation on earth.\\n\\nSo, 22 percent of U.S. military spending for 15 years could permanently end extreme poverty globally.\\n\\nWith the globe spending roughly $2 trillion per year on militarism (roughly half of it by the United States), we can also say that 1.5% of GLOBAL military spending could end starvation on earth.\\n\\nAre you ready to end all war yet? We are.\\n\\nMatt Agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the USMC and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the NSA.

These adjustments are not tied to specific accounting transactions, but they are often included in account summaries to cover for balances between systems that cannot be reconciled.\\n\\nAs The Free Thought Project has reported, not only is it likely that the actual amount of money the DoD and HUD cannot account for is much higher than $21 trillion, due to the fact that researchers did not have access to complete data, but the practice of creating counterfeit adjustments appears to be standard procedure.\\n\\n\\u201cPerhaps even more troubling than the total amount lost is the fact that fraudulent behavior from HUD and DOD seem to be the standard operating procedure. In fact, the accounting for these funds is so poor, that as Reuters notes, the Defense Finance and Accounting Services (DFAS) refers to the preparation of the Army\\u2019s year-end statements as \\u2018the grand plug\\u2019 \\u2014 \\u2018plug\\u2019 is accounting jargon for the insertion of made-up numbers. For every transaction, a so-called \\u2018journal voucher\\u2019 that provides serial numbers, transaction dates and the amount of the expenditure is supposed to be produced. The report specifies that the agency has done such a poor job in providing documentation of their transactions, that there is no way to actually know how $21 trillion has been spent.\\u201d\\n\\nThe problem is so bad, that these warmongers have \\u2018lost\\u2019 $58,386 per second since 9/11.\\n\\nThose of us not blinded by the propaganda and false patriotism, see the inevitable results of such a propensity for supporting war. We see domestic infrastructure crumbling, a national debt increasing by record amounts each year, more conflict around the globe, and countless veterans suffering from PTSD. When will it all end? At this pace, it won\\u2019t end until the empire falls.\\n\\nLuckily, there are people waging a campaign to prevent further war and subsequent deficit spending. They are paying to put up billboards showing just how much of your money the US steals to blow up brown people in foreign countries. The group is World Beyond War and their efforts are massive. For the last several years, they\\u2019ve been putting up powerful billboards all over the country. One of them can be seen below.\\n\\nThey back these numbers up with data on their website, pointing out that in 2008, the United Nations said that $30 billion per year could end hunger on earth, as reported in the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and many other outlets. The Food and Agriculture Organization has not updated that figure since 2008, and has recently told us that such figures do not require much updating. In a separate report, most recently published in 2015, the same organization provides a figure of $265 billion as the cost per year for 15 years to permanently eliminate extreme poverty, which would eliminate starvation and malnutrition \\u2014 a broader project than just preventing starvation one year at a time. The FAO\\u2019s spokesperson informed us in an email: \\u201cI think it would be incorrect to compare the two figures as the 265 billion has been calculated taking into consideration a number of initiatives including social protection cash transfers aimed at extracting people from extreme poverty and not just hunger.\\u201d\\n\\nAs of 2019, the annual Pentagon base budget, plus war budget, plus nuclear weapons in the Department of Energy, plus Homeland Security and other military spending totaled well over $1 trillion \\u2014 not counting what\\u2019s \\u201clost.\\u201d\\n\\nSo, 3% of U.S. military spending could end starvation on earth.\\n\\nSo, 22 percent of U.S. military spending for 15 years could permanently end extreme poverty globally.\\n\\nWith the globe spending roughly $2 trillion per year on militarism (roughly half of it by the United States), we can also say that 1.5% of GLOBAL military spending could end starvation on earth.\\n\\nAre you ready to end all war yet? We are.\\n\\nMatt Agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the USMC and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the NSA.

Propylene is a colorless gas used to produce chemicals in plastics, synthetic rubber and gasoline. It is highly flammable and can explode in a fire. People exposed to propylene can become dizzy and light-headed, and the gas can also cause liver damage.\\n\\nNearby homes sustained significant damage. Some were knocked off their foundations. Manny Jawa, a volunteer with the Houston office of the American Red Cross, said his agency had helped about 100 people who came to an evacuation shelter that had been set up around 6 a.m. Friday at a church near the blast site. The shelter offered residents food and water and information about help they could receive.\\n\\nOfficials said that they planned to open an overnight shelter at a different church for residents who had been displaced from their homes and had nowhere else to go.

He said the blast also broke glass on part of his front windows. \\u201cEverybody seems to be OK now. That\\u2019s the main thing,\\u201d Wilson said.\\n\\nMiguel Ramirez, 65, tried to get out of his bedroom to see what had happened, but his bedroom door would not open. Ramirez said he had his son hand him a small screwdriver through an opening underneath the door and he used that to remove the pins from the door\\u2019s hinges so he could get out.\\n\\nOnce he got out, Ramirez said he found that a large portion of the ceiling in his living room had collapsed onto the floor and sofa. Chunks of insulation were on the carpeted living room and on the couch. The wooden beams on the ceiling were exposed.\\n\\nThe explosion also shattered the sliding door in his kitchen that leads to his backyard. Bits of glass were strewn all over the kitchen floor and a dining room table that still had plates from when the family ate Thursday night. The blast also knocked off from the ceiling in the kitchen.\\n\\n\\u201cThe good thing is nobody got hurt,\\u201d said Ramirez, who lives about 500 feet (150 meters) away from the company where the explosion occurred. He lives in the home with his wife, son and daughter. The blast shook other buildings, with reports on Twitter of a boom felt across the city. Pena said there were no reports of hazardous air quality, based on monitoring done by a hazardous materials team.\\n\\nA phone number for Watson Grinding was out of service when called by a reporter with The Associated Press on Friday morning. The family-owned business manufactures valves and provides thermal-spray coatings for equipment used in the chemical, mining, petroleum and aerospace industries, among others, according to its website.\\n\\nAbout 90,000 people live within 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) of the company, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Houston police tweeted that officers were blocking off streets, but no evacuation was ordered. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said first responders checked on residents of nearby homes.\\n\\nHouston Mayor Sylvester Turner said on Twitter said there was no hazard in the air \\u201cfrom all indications,\\u201d but that authorities continued to monitor. This part of Texas is home to the highest concentration of oil refineries in the nation and has experienced a series of explosions in recent years. Last July, an explosion at an ExxonMobil refinery in Baytown, east of Houston, left more than dozen people with minor injuries and put nearby residents under a shelter-in-place advisory for three hours.\\n\\nIn December, two blasts in the coastal city of Port Neches shattered windows and ripped the doors from nearby homes. Two homeowners are already suing Watson Grinding, accusing the company of negligence and demanding more than $1 million in damages. According to one lawsuit filed by homeowner Sophia Navarro, the blast blew out the windows of her home, with glass strewn inside and outside, and fractured the home's walls and foundation.\\n\\n\\u201cThis is not the first time Houston has seen massive explosions, nor is it the first time that widespread areas of Houston and surrounding areas have suffered from the effects of such a massive explosion,\\u201d the lawsuit says.\\n\\nAssociated Press writer Jill Bleed contributed to this report from Little Rock, Arkansas.\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.mail.com/news/us/9683214-police-2-dead-warehouse-explosion-shakes-houston.html\", \"published\": \"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 22:35:00 GMT\", \"published_utc\": 1579923300, \"collection_utc\": 1579912769}",News,1579923300

Danny Wilson, 63, who lives less than a mile from the site, said he was sleeping when his wife woke him up.\\n\\n\\u201cShe heard a big noise and the (grandkids) were running out of their rooms,\\u201d Wilson said. \\u201cShe said it was some kind of explosion or somebody was trying to get in.\\u201d Wilson said he first checked inside his home to make sure nobody had broken in and then he went outside and talked to neighbors to find out what was going on and to check for any damage.\\n\\n\\u201cI didn\\u2019t notice any broken glass and I looked at the back window and it was shattered big time,\\u201d Wilson said.

Ramirez said he had his son hand him a small screwdriver through an opening underneath the door and he used that to remove the pins from the door\\u2019s hinges so he could get out.\\n\\nOnce he got out, Ramirez said he found that a large portion of the ceiling in his living room had collapsed onto the floor and sofa. Chunks of insulation were on the carpeted living room and on the couch. The wooden beams on the ceiling were exposed.\\n\\nThe explosion also shattered the sliding door in his kitchen that leads to his backyard.

Manny Jawa, a volunteer with the Houston office of the American Red Cross, said his agency had helped about 100 people who came to an evacuation shelter that had been set up around 6 a.m. Friday at a church near the blast site. The shelter offered residents food and water and information about help they could receive.\\n\\nOfficials said that they planned to open an overnight shelter at a different church for residents who had been displaced from their homes and had nowhere else to go. Danny Wilson, 63, who lives less than a mile from the site, said he was sleeping when his wife woke him up.\\n\\n\\u201cShe heard a big noise and the (grandkids) were running out of their rooms,\\u201d Wilson said. \\u201cShe said it was some kind of explosion or somebody was trying to get in.\\u201d Wilson said he first checked inside his home to make sure nobody had broken in and then he went outside and talked to neighbors to find out what was going on and to check for any damage.\\n\\n\\u201cI didn\\u2019t notice any broken glass and I looked at the back window and it was shattered big time,\\u201d Wilson said.

That\\u2019s the main thing,\\u201d Wilson said.\\n\\nMiguel Ramirez, 65, tried to get out of his bedroom to see what had happened, but his bedroom door would not open. Ramirez said he had his son hand him a small screwdriver through an opening underneath the door and he used that to remove the pins from the door\\u2019s hinges so he could get out.\\n\\nOnce he got out, Ramirez said he found that a large portion of the ceiling in his living room had collapsed onto the floor and sofa. Chunks of insulation were on the carpeted living room and on the couch. The wooden beams on the ceiling were exposed.\\n\\nThe explosion also shattered the sliding door in his kitchen that leads to his backyard.

The building was reduced to burning rubble and debris, and some of the surrounding buildings suffered heavy damage to parts of their walls and roofs.\\n\\nPolice Chief Art Acevedo confirmed the deaths Friday and said it was likely both people worked for the company. He said a family member of one of the people suspected to have died was a U.S. Marine currently training at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and called on the Marines to let the man return to Houston.\\n\\n\\u201cDo a search around your own home and your own neighborhood, even if you're a mile away from this location,\\u201d Acevedo said. \\\"Look for any debris, any body parts, anything that may be related. If you find anything in your immediate home, in your yard, don't touch it. Just call the Houston Police Department so we can respond.\\\"\\n\\nHouston Fire Chief Samuel Pena said hazardous materials crews have secured the valve on a 2,000-gallon (7,571-liter) tank of propylene that had been leaking. Propylene is a colorless gas used to produce chemicals in plastics, synthetic rubber and gasoline. It is highly flammable and can explode in a fire. People exposed to propylene can become dizzy and light-headed, and the gas can also cause liver damage.\\n\\nManny Jawa, a volunteer with the Houston office of the American Red Cross, said his agency had helped about 100 people who came to an evacuation shelter that had been set up around 6 a.m. Friday at a church near the blast site. The shelter offered residents food and water and information about help they could receive.\\n\\nWilson said he first checked inside his home to make sure nobody had broken in and then he went outside and talked to neighbors to find out what was going on and to check for any damage.\\n\\nRamirez said he had his son hand him a small screwdriver through an opening underneath the door and he used that to remove the pins from the door\\u2019s hinges so he could get out.\\n\\nOnce he got out, Ramirez said he found that a large portion of the ceiling in his living room had collapsed onto the floor and sofa. Chunks of insulation were on the carpeted living room and on the couch. The wooden beams on the ceiling were exposed.\\n\\nThe explosion also shattered the sliding door in his kitchen that leads to his backyard. Bits of glass were strewn all over the kitchen floor and a dining room table that still had plates from when the family ate Thursday night. The blast also knocked off from the ceiling in the kitchen.\\n\\nA phone number for Watson Grinding was out of service when called by a reporter with The Associated Press on Friday morning.

But Sheamus is back and - in his own words - \\u2018better\\u2019 than ever.\\n\\nThe three-time WWE champion was sidelined with a lengthy injury and took some time away from the Smackdown brand to recuperate.\\n\\nHe went to the Rugby World Cup in Japan to cheer on his native Ireland and has enjoyed watching his beloved Liverpool canter towards what will be their first league title in 30 years.\\n\\nBut Sheamus - who makes his official big return at Sunday\\u2019s Royal Rumble pay-per-view live on BT Sport Box Office - has allayed fears that was set to retired from the squared-cirlcle.\\n\\nAs he prepares to take on Shorty G in Houston, Texas, he insists he still has it all to do in WWE, including winning the one championship that has eluded him: the Intercontinental title.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m really excited,\\u201d he said, speaking exclusively to Mirror WWE.\\n\\n\\u201cI feel better now and more equipped now to get back in the ring than I ever have. I even feel like I\\u2019m in better shape now than when I first started. I\\u2019ve still got a lot to achieve.\\n\\n\\u201cI just know that my mindset going into this now is that I have the Intercontinental title left to win to complete the set. If I do that, I would have held every single championship.\\n\\n\\u201cI just want to get back in the ring and really cement my legacy. I have a lot of stuff left to prove.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m not happy where I\\u2019m at right now, despite what I have achieved. Some people say to me, \\u2018You must be crazy.\\u2019 But that\\u2019s all in the past and I want to achieve more.\\u201d\\n\\nAs for the signature 30-man over-the-top-rope Rumble match itself, it is unlikely Sheamus - the winner in 2012 - will enter.\\n\\nBut just to be competing again is good enough for him - and he credits his burgeoning YouTube channel, Celtic Warrior Workouts, for inspiring his return to the ring.\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know if I will be in it [the Rumble match] as I haven\\u2019t been confirmed yet - but I am looking forward to it,\\u201d he said.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m just looking forward to getting back to work. I\\u2019ve been off for quite a while. And in the meantime, I\\u2019ve worked my a*** off to get myself back in shape. \\u201cI\\u2019ve got my YouTube channel, Celtic Warrior Workouts, which I\\u2019m super passionate about.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s inspiring a lot of people. I read the comments. And it\\u2019s unbelievable. In fact, it\\u2019s so inspirational to see that it\\u2019s helping so many people. That was the aim of the channel. You leave your ego at the door and it\\u2019s about brave change.\\n\\n\\u201cThen, of course, being back on Smackdown Live and brogue kicking Shorty G and all the backstage promos\\u2026 I\\u2019m really excited.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Irish fighter, meanwhile, admits he would love to get back to his native Dublin more often.\\n\\nIn fact, he say it is one of his goals to do so this year, now that the Smackdown superstar\\u2019s working schedule has changed.\\n\\nBut he insists moving to Nashville has brought out the best of him after moving away from the heat of Tampa, Florida.\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t get home enough,\\u201d the former WWE champion confessed.\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s really the bottom line. Especially being in the States for over 12 years now. It doesn\\u2019t feel like a long time but when you get home and see your folks, your sister and everything, it\\u2019s nice.\\n\\n\\u201cI need to get home more, man. That\\u2019s one of my goals for 2020 to do that. Now with the schedule we have with Smackdown on a Friday, I think I\\u2019ve got a better chance of doing that.\\n\\n\\u201cI lived in Tampa for 10 years and it was just not the right weather for me. It was like, oh man, it\\u2019s 100 degrees - the one month that it wasn\\u2019t, was December. So it burnt me out a bit.\\n\\n\\u201cBut Nashville\\u2019s great. It does get hot there in the summer. But you do have the seasons and that\\u2019s great.\\n\\n\\u201cAt Christmas time, it feels like Christmas, you know what I\\u2019m saying. Right now, it\\u2019s probably the same temperature there than it is in London. The summers can be a bit mad but then again, everywhere in the States the summers can be a bit mad.\\u201d\\n\\nHis long-term thoughts are fixed on Tampa for April, however, which we see WWE\\u2019s annual showcase WrestleMania hosted at the Raymond James Stadium, home to NFL team Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\\n\\nAnd when it comes to his 'Mania dream match, he reiterates his goal is to win the title he is yet to hold.\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to sound like a broken record, but if it\\u2019s for the Intercontinental championship, then that\\u2019s what I really want,\\u201d says the Liverpool-supporting superstar - who cannot avoid referencing his beloved Reds alongside his own ambitions.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s the missing piece from my trophy cabinet. Its like the league title for Liverpool.\\n\\n\\u201cThey might have won the European Cup but that\\u2019s the one they really, really want now. The Intercontinental title is my Premier League title.\\n\\n\\\"That\\u2019s the thing that has been on my mind more than anything on my way to coming back and now that I am back.\\n\\n\\u201cNext time I\\u2019m over here [in London] on the tour in May, I\\u2019ll be bringing it with me.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 BT Sport is the new home of WWE in the UK.

Easy, that is, until you see a photograph from the early 20th century showing much of the valley bare of trees.\\n\\nLandscapes are much more than one frozen moment. They are palimpsests revealing, once you learn how to look, layer after layer of dynamic natural and cultural changes.\\n\\nVisitors also flock to the same valley for a sense of history, to soak up the atmosphere of the medieval monastic university city linked to St Kevin, for whom a pilgrim path has recently been laid out in the adjacent valley of Glendasan.\\n\\nA more adventurous minority climb over the Spinc and Mullacor into neighbouring Glenmalure, to conjure up the rebel spirits of Feagh McHugh O\\u2019Byrne and Michael Dwyer, with their heroic narratives of anti-colonial resistance.\\n\\nEn route, these hikers pass traces of a heritage revealing a very different layer of our history. The exceptional industrial archaeology of these valleys is much more recent than St Kevin, O\\u2019Byrne or even Dwyer. But it has long been neglected, and much of it has disappeared into the hillsides that gave it birth.\\n\\nNow it has been rescued, thanks to the dedication of some local individuals, and the support of academics and State agencies.\\n\\nIf you walk the long path, so quiet today, that borders Glendalough\\u2019s upper lake, you might wonder at the unusual concentration of Scots pines towering all around you. Walk a little further, and you will come on remnants of the Miners\\u2019 Village, a misleading name because it was more production site than home place.\\n\\nLead, extracted by hard labour from galleries under the slopes above you, was processed here as recently as 1935. The pines were planted to make pit props.\\n\\n\\u201cPeople didn\\u2019t consider the ordinary things to be history,\\u201d says Carmel O\\u2019Toole, whose book Glenmalure: The Wild Heart of the Mountains is a richly detailed hymn to the human communities of her native valley.\\n\\nFor most of us, the revelation that these quintessentially remote and rural valleys were once significant industrial centres is rather extraordinary. But O\\u2019Toole is right. Rural labourers, whether industrial or agricultural, are often the invisible people in our mainstream national narratives.\\n\\nMany individuals and groups deserve credit for recovering the mining heritage of these glens, but O\\u2019Toole gives particular kudos to one remarkable man, Robert Carter, who worked as a teenager in the last active Wicklow lead mines, in Glendasan, until 1957.\\n\\n\\u201cOnly for you, none of this would have happened,\\u201d she tells him.\\n\\nHe has certainly accumulated meticulous records. He comes to our meeting with a box containing individual photographs of the 80 men who worked with him. He also shows me a yellowed but carefully preserved Wicklow People clipping. It\\u2019s a report on an inquest on his workmate, James Mernagh, who was killed in an accident that very seriously injured Carter (see below).\\n\\nDespite, or perhaps because of, this grim experience, Carter has always wanted the lives and labour of the Wicklow miners to be recognised and remembered. As a hill-walker, he sometimes encountered hikers who expressed curiosity about the slag heaps, ruined buildings and rusted machinery that are scattered over the valley slopes. He enjoyed telling them what he knew.\\n\\nMeanwhile, two valleys away in Glenmalure, O\\u2019Toole was completing research for her book. When some granite troughs were stolen from outside her home, a worrying thought struck her.\\n\\nThe same fate could very easily befall the first-class granite stonework that had created the mining infrastructure in the valley, at Ballinafunshoge and Baravore, without anyone noticing. To protect this heritage, it needed to be restored, and cherished.\\n\\nShe got the Pure Mile group in Glenmalure interested, and they contacted a mining heritage committee already active in Glendalough. An integrated group called Glens of Lead was formed.\\n\\nThe outcome, with support from bodies including the Wicklow Uplands Council, Coillte, the Heritage Council, the County Council and F\\u00e1ilte Ireland, was the restoration of collapsing buildings, and the creation of the Miners\\u2019 Way. This is an exceptionally scenic 18 km trail linking the three valleys by way of their 10 mining sites.\\n\\nYou can walk from either end, but starting at the high point in Glendasan, just off the Wicklow Gap road, gives a magical sense of penetrating ever more deeply into the mountains.

Himmler watched the entire process of mass murder on 17 July 1942: from arrival by train and selection of those who would die to killing in the gas chamber and the removal of bodies.\\n\\nHimmler's own diary makes no mention of being present at the murder of Dutch Jews, but it was during this visit on 17-18 July 1942 that he decided to expand the capacity of Birkenau to 200,000 prisoners.\\n\\nThe extermination of Jews there was to continue until November 1944.\\n\\nIt has long been known that no birds sing at the sites of Nazi death camps, and that was certainly true at Auschwitz.\\n\\nTaking a final look in the fading light at the decaying blocks where my grandfather had been murdered, I saw a fox scurrying along a trench dug by camp prisoners.\\n\\nGrey and barely noticeable. A rare sign of life in such a desolate place.\\n\\nThe names of all 102,000 Jews, Sinti and Roma from the Netherlands who were murdered by the Nazis are being read out alphabetically, in a ceremony at Westerbork lasting six days and five nights that culminates on 27 January at 14:30 GMT.\\n\\nFind out more about Auschwitz and the Holocaust:\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51187969\", \"published\": \"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 00:11:45 GMT\", \"published_utc\": 1579929105, \"collection_utc\": 1579954106}",News,1579929105

CrisisFACTS-010-News-106-0,CrisisFACTS-010,would a draft be necessary to fight a third world war,"{\"id\": \"nationalinterest--2020-01-25--Would a Draft Be Necessary to Fight a Third World War?\", \"date\": \"2020-01-25\", \"source\": \"nationalinterest\", \"title\": \"Would a Draft Be Necessary to Fight a Third World War?\", \"content\": \"Key point: A draft is politically unacceptable. However, if the existence of the country were really at stake, then it would become necessary to bring it back.\\n\\nSince the 1970s, the United States has had an All-Volunteer Force (AVF). From the beginning of the United States until the end of the Vietnam War, the country had always conscripted eligible male members of its population to fight\\u2014and win\\u2014the nation\\u2019s wars. Yet, the American experience in Vietnam broke the national consensus on the draft. Since then, policymakers have struggled to square public ambivalence about foreign intervention with what they\\u2019ve viewed as preserving the national interest.\\n\\nNixon was not alone in his support for an AVF. Many military leaders who had fought in Vietnam supported it, realizing that those who volunteered to serve and fight in a war were usually more effective in combat than those who were simply drafted into service. Despite the strategic failures of the AVF in Afghanistan and Iraq, most military leaders today insist upon preserving the AVF rather than institute conscription. The brilliant economist, Milton Friedman, hailed the creation of an AVF as a momentous step toward national progress. Friedman argued that a conscription force was ultimately one in which its members were slaves until the conflict ends (or they die). On the other hand, Friedman believed that an AVF was a military in which its members had their freedom preserved. The AVF has also fostered a degree of technological innovation that helped to keep the U.S. force smaller than it ordinarily would be\\u2014freeing up more Americans to, theoretically, become net contributors to America\\u2019s economic miracle. When the draft existed, it was created because warfare was a truly national endeavor. Today, we are told, wars are fought by small teams of elite professionals\\u2014like the Medieval knights of old. Should a great power conflict erupt, though, the age of specialization in warfare will go away, and total warfare will again be upon us again.\\n\\nCurrently, the U.S. defense budget is 4.2 percent of America\\u2019s overall GDP. While the defense budget in the United States is considerably higher than the defense budgets of its major rivals, it is at historic lows (it reached 15 percent of U.S. GDP during the Korean War). More importantly, less than one percent of the American population (1.29 million Americans) serves in the military. Further, in 2016, nearly one-in-five military deaths in Afghanistan were of private military contractors.\\n\\nNot only have private contractors augmented the U.S. AVF, but so too has technology. What the Chinese routinely refer to as \\u201cAmerican Magic\\u201d has become a force multiplier for that relatively small, expeditionary AVF. Satellites, airpower, cyber combat, drones, and a coterie of other technical assets have allowed for the relatively small U.S. military to punch above its weight. Yet, the U.S. military and its leaders have come to fetishize high-technology and rely far too much on it to make up for real weaknesses in its overall force structure. The w\\u00fcnderwaffe will not save U.S. forces when a world war starts. U.S. Policymakers today tend to forget that wars are still fought and won by men, not machines. American rivals have not forgotten this timeless truth.\\n\\nWhat few understand is that the AVF arose at a time when great interstate conflict was not a serious possibility. The enemies that the United States military fought against were usually insurgent-type forces engaged in various wars of liberation. Even during the Cold War, the Soviet Union\\u2019s direct threat to the United States was predominantly ideological, technological, and covert. Back then, the threat of an actual conflict erupting between the two superpowers was relatively low.\\n\\nToday, however, the chances for great state conflict are high. As the threat of interstate warfare increases, America\\u2019s small expeditionary force (which is wearing thin from decades of constant deployments) will be insufficient to meet the challenges that rival great powers, such as China or Russia, pose to the U.S. military. This is especially true, considering the focus of America\\u2019s enemies on depriving U.S. forces of their aforementioned technological advantages.\\n\\nAs I detail in the opening chapter of my forthcoming book, Winning Space: How America Remains a Superpower, which will be released in 2020 by the Republic Book Publishers, the first shots of another world war will be fired in space against America\\u2019s satellite constellations. From there, cyber and information warfare techniques will be used to sow chaos and degrade America\\u2019s resistance quotient\\u2014before U.S. military forces can even respond to an attack by either Russia or China. Once U.S. forces deploy, with their technological abilities stunted, they will then have to penetrate intense anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) bubbles where U.S. warplanes and transports will likely suffer high attrition rates if they move in too close.\\n\\nThis is where technologists will assert hypersonic weapons will be key. But, suppose the United States does not have a robust enough arsenal of hypersonic vehicles, how long does Washington wait for enough of those units to be built in order to retaliate against those who attack American forces? And, what happens during that interregnum? Or, how will these weapons systems operate effectively in a degraded environment where GPS signals were being jammed? Meanwhile, the loss of America\\u2019s satellites will ensure that U.S. forces responsible for defending either Europe or rolling back a Chinese invasion of Taiwan will be too small, disoriented, and isolated away from America\\u2019s power base to effectively resist either a Russian invasion of Eastern Europe or a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\\n\\nThe AVF model will simply be insufficient to supply the military with the force levels that will be required to go up against China\\u2019s 2.18 million-man military or Russia's more than one million-man force. American troops will also have to learn to fight in a pre-1970s manner, where smart bombs will be dumber; quantity will be more preferable to quality; America\\u2019s global logistical supply chain will not be secured, and any war will be as bloody as either of the world wars. It will also be a time when not even the American homeland will be spared from the devastation and chaos of a great power war (nor would the homelands of either China or Russia).\\n\\nThe United States does not have the industrial capacity to surge the construction of weapons and materiel needed to outlast and defeat its rivals in either China or Russia. Already, U.S. shipyards are having trouble meeting the increased demand for output in terms of building the Navy\\u2019s new Virginia-class submarines. These industrial flops are occurring all over America\\u2019s domestic supply chain. America\\u2019s latent industrial capabilities proved to be a decisive advantage over its foes in both world wars. This is a capability that America lacks today\\u2014and it will take much time and effort to rehabilitate (if it happens at all). American rivals will not wait around for the United States to reconstitute those lost capabilities. Meanwhile, countries, notably China, do possess such industrial capabilities today. Thus far, U.S. industrial policy, despite the enactment of a trade war against China, and demands to \\u201creshore\\u201d U.S. manufacturing abilities from abroad, has been mostly unchanged.\\n\\nOne thing is certain, though, when another great power war erupts, it will not be relegated to being fought between two, well-trained forces of professionals on distant battlefields. Nor would the fighting be quick, short, and sharp. It will be waged along the lines of previous great wars wherein great powers possessed of relatively equal capabilities leveled each other. Mark Cancian believes that \\u201cafter about nine months of intense peer conflict, attrition would grind the U.S. armed forces down to something resembling the military of a regional power.\\\" That is unless the United States can embrace a total warfare ethos\\u2014as it did in the world wars.\\n\\nSuch a total war, mind you, will devastate the world order. Premodern tribalism will quickly replace postmodern enlightenment\\u2014especially as the technological trappings of modernity were stripped away. The exchange of nuclear, not to mention biological and chemical, weapons will be a high probability as the combatants looked for leverage over one another, just as the Germans and Allies did with chemical weapons in the First World War, the longer that war ground on. This would especially be the case after early-warning missile satellites were knocked out in the opening phases of a space war.

However, if the existence of the country were really at stake, then it would become necessary to bring it back.\\n\\nSince the 1970s, the United States has had an All-Volunteer Force (AVF). From the beginning of the United States until the end of the Vietnam War, the country had always conscripted eligible male members of its population to fight\\u2014and win\\u2014the nation\\u2019s wars. Yet, the American experience in Vietnam broke the national consensus on the draft. Since then, policymakers have struggled to square public ambivalence about foreign intervention with what they\\u2019ve viewed as preserving the national interest.\\n\\nNixon was not alone in his support for an AVF. Many military leaders who had fought in Vietnam supported it, realizing that those who volunteered to serve and fight in a war were usually more effective in combat than those who were simply drafted into service. Despite the strategic failures of the AVF in Afghanistan and Iraq, most military leaders today insist upon preserving the AVF rather than institute conscription. The brilliant economist, Milton Friedman, hailed the creation of an AVF as a momentous step toward national progress. Friedman argued that a conscription force was ultimately one in which its members were slaves until the conflict ends (or they die). On the other hand, Friedman believed that an AVF was a military in which its members had their freedom preserved. The AVF has also fostered a degree of technological innovation that helped to keep the U.S. force smaller than it ordinarily would be\\u2014freeing up more Americans to, theoretically, become net contributors to America\\u2019s economic miracle. When the draft existed, it was created because warfare was a truly national endeavor. Today, we are told, wars are fought by small teams of elite professionals\\u2014like the Medieval knights of old. Should a great power conflict erupt, though, the age of specialization in warfare will go away, and total warfare will again be upon us again.\\n\\nCurrently, the U.S. defense budget is 4.2 percent of America\\u2019s overall GDP. While the defense budget in the United States is considerably higher than the defense budgets of its major rivals, it is at historic lows (it reached 15 percent of U.S. GDP during the Korean War). More importantly, less than one percent of the American population (1.29 million Americans) serves in the military. Further, in 2016, nearly one-in-five military deaths in Afghanistan were of private military contractors.\\n\\nNot only have private contractors augmented the U.S. AVF, but so too has technology. What the Chinese routinely refer to as \\u201cAmerican Magic\\u201d has become a force multiplier for that relatively small, expeditionary AVF. Satellites, airpower, cyber combat, drones, and a coterie of other technical assets have allowed for the relatively small U.S. military to punch above its weight. Yet, the U.S. military and its leaders have come to fetishize high-technology and rely far too much on it to make up for real weaknesses in its overall force structure. The w\\u00fcnderwaffe will not save U.S. forces when a world war starts. U.S. Policymakers today tend to forget that wars are still fought and won by men, not machines. American rivals have not forgotten this timeless truth.\\n\\nWhat few understand is that the AVF arose at a time when great interstate conflict was not a serious possibility. The enemies that the United States military fought against were usually insurgent-type forces engaged in various wars of liberation. Even during the Cold War, the Soviet Union\\u2019s direct threat to the United States was predominantly ideological, technological, and covert. Back then, the threat of an actual conflict erupting between the two superpowers was relatively low.\\n\\nToday, however, the chances for great state conflict are high. As the threat of interstate warfare increases, America\\u2019s small expeditionary force (which is wearing thin from decades of constant deployments) will be insufficient to meet the challenges that rival great powers, such as China or Russia, pose to the U.S. military. This is especially true, considering the focus of America\\u2019s enemies on depriving U.S. forces of their aforementioned technological advantages.\\n\\nAs I detail in the opening chapter of my forthcoming book, Winning Space: How America Remains a Superpower, which will be released in 2020 by the Republic Book Publishers, the first shots of another world war will be fired in space against America\\u2019s satellite constellations. From there, cyber and information warfare techniques will be used to sow chaos and degrade America\\u2019s resistance quotient\\u2014before U.S. military forces can even respond to an attack by either Russia or China. Once U.S. forces deploy, with their technological abilities stunted, they will then have to penetrate intense anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) bubbles where U.S. warplanes and transports will likely suffer high attrition rates if they move in too close.\\n\\nThis is where technologists will assert hypersonic weapons will be key. But, suppose the United States does not have a robust enough arsenal of hypersonic vehicles, how long does Washington wait for enough of those units to be built in order to retaliate against those who attack American forces? And, what happens during that interregnum? Or, how will these weapons systems operate effectively in a degraded environment where GPS signals were being jammed? Meanwhile, the loss of America\\u2019s satellites will ensure that U.S. forces responsible for defending either Europe or rolling back a Chinese invasion of Taiwan will be too small, disoriented, and isolated away from America\\u2019s power base to effectively resist either a Russian invasion of Eastern Europe or a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\\n\\nThe AVF model will simply be insufficient to supply the military with the force levels that will be required to go up against China\\u2019s 2.18 million-man military or Russia's more than one million-man force. American troops will also have to learn to fight in a pre-1970s manner, where smart bombs will be dumber; quantity will be more preferable to quality; America\\u2019s global logistical supply chain will not be secured, and any war will be as bloody as either of the world wars. It will also be a time when not even the American homeland will be spared from the devastation and chaos of a great power war (nor would the homelands of either China or Russia).\\n\\nThe United States does not have the industrial capacity to surge the construction of weapons and materiel needed to outlast and defeat its rivals in either China or Russia. Already, U.S. shipyards are having trouble meeting the increased demand for output in terms of building the Navy\\u2019s new Virginia-class submarines. These industrial flops are occurring all over America\\u2019s domestic supply chain. America\\u2019s latent industrial capabilities proved to be a decisive advantage over its foes in both world wars. This is a capability that America lacks today\\u2014and it will take much time and effort to rehabilitate (if it happens at all). American rivals will not wait around for the United States to reconstitute those lost capabilities. Meanwhile, countries, notably China, do possess such industrial capabilities today. Thus far, U.S. industrial policy, despite the enactment of a trade war against China, and demands to \\u201creshore\\u201d U.S. manufacturing abilities from abroad, has been mostly unchanged.\\n\\nOne thing is certain, though, when another great power war erupts, it will not be relegated to being fought between two, well-trained forces of professionals on distant battlefields. Nor would the fighting be quick, short, and sharp. It will be waged along the lines of previous great wars wherein great powers possessed of relatively equal capabilities leveled each other.

The exchange of nuclear, not to mention biological and chemical, weapons will be a high probability as the combatants looked for leverage over one another, just as the Germans and Allies did with chemical weapons in the First World War, the longer that war ground on.

Despite the strategic failures of the AVF in Afghanistan and Iraq, most military leaders today insist upon preserving the AVF rather than institute conscription. The brilliant economist, Milton Friedman, hailed the creation of an AVF as a momentous step toward national progress. Friedman argued that a conscription force was ultimately one in which its members were slaves until the conflict ends (or they die). On the other hand, Friedman believed that an AVF was a military in which its members had their freedom preserved. The AVF has also fostered a degree of technological innovation that helped to keep the U.S. force smaller than it ordinarily would be\\u2014freeing up more Americans to, theoretically, become net contributors to America\\u2019s economic miracle. When the draft existed, it was created because warfare was a truly national endeavor. Today, we are told, wars are fought by small teams of elite professionals\\u2014like the Medieval knights of old. Should a great power conflict erupt, though, the age of specialization in warfare will go away, and total warfare will again be upon us again.\\n\\nCurrently, the U.S. defense budget is 4.2 percent of America\\u2019s overall GDP. While the defense budget in the United States is considerably higher than the defense budgets of its major rivals, it is at historic lows (it reached 15 percent of U.S. GDP during the Korean War). More importantly, less than one percent of the American population (1.29 million Americans) serves in the military. Further, in 2016, nearly one-in-five military deaths in Afghanistan were of private military contractors.\\n\\nNot only have private contractors augmented the U.S. AVF, but so too has technology. What the Chinese routinely refer to as \\u201cAmerican Magic\\u201d has become a force multiplier for that relatively small, expeditionary AVF. Satellites, airpower, cyber combat, drones, and a coterie of other technical assets have allowed for the relatively small U.S. military to punch above its weight. Yet, the U.S. military and its leaders have come to fetishize high-technology and rely far too much on it to make up for real weaknesses in its overall force structure. The w\\u00fcnderwaffe will not save U.S. forces when a world war starts. U.S. Policymakers today tend to forget that wars are still fought and won by men, not machines. American rivals have not forgotten this timeless truth.\\n\\nWhat few understand is that the AVF arose at a time when great interstate conflict was not a serious possibility. The enemies that the United States military fought against were usually insurgent-type forces engaged in various wars of liberation. Even during the Cold War, the Soviet Union\\u2019s direct threat to the United States was predominantly ideological, technological, and covert. Back then, the threat of an actual conflict erupting between the two superpowers was relatively low.\\n\\nToday, however, the chances for great state conflict are high. As the threat of interstate warfare increases, America\\u2019s small expeditionary force (which is wearing thin from decades of constant deployments) will be insufficient to meet the challenges that rival great powers, such as China or Russia, pose to the U.S. military. This is especially true, considering the focus of America\\u2019s enemies on depriving U.S. forces of their aforementioned technological advantages.\\n\\nAs I detail in the opening chapter of my forthcoming book, Winning Space: How America Remains a Superpower, which will be released in 2020 by the Republic Book Publishers, the first shots of another world war will be fired in space against America\\u2019s satellite constellations. From there, cyber and information warfare techniques will be used to sow chaos and degrade America\\u2019s resistance quotient\\u2014before U.S. military forces can even respond to an attack by either Russia or China. Once U.S. forces deploy, with their technological abilities stunted, they will then have to penetrate intense anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) bubbles where U.S. warplanes and transports will likely suffer high attrition rates if they move in too close.\\n\\nThis is where technologists will assert hypersonic weapons will be key. But, suppose the United States does not have a robust enough arsenal of hypersonic vehicles, how long does Washington wait for enough of those units to be built in order to retaliate against those who attack American forces? And, what happens during that interregnum? Or, how will these weapons systems operate effectively in a degraded environment where GPS signals were being jammed? Meanwhile, the loss of America\\u2019s satellites will ensure that U.S. forces responsible for defending either Europe or rolling back a Chinese invasion of Taiwan will be too small, disoriented, and isolated away from America\\u2019s power base to effectively resist either a Russian invasion of Eastern Europe or a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\\n\\nThe AVF model will simply be insufficient to supply the military with the force levels that will be required to go up against China\\u2019s 2.18 million-man military or Russia's more than one million-man force. American troops will also have to learn to fight in a pre-1970s manner, where smart bombs will be dumber; quantity will be more preferable to quality; America\\u2019s global logistical supply chain will not be secured, and any war will be as bloody as either of the world wars. It will also be a time when not even the American homeland will be spared from the devastation and chaos of a great power war (nor would the homelands of either China or Russia).\\n\\nThe United States does not have the industrial capacity to surge the construction of weapons and materiel needed to outlast and defeat its rivals in either China or Russia. Already, U.S. shipyards are having trouble meeting the increased demand for output in terms of building the Navy\\u2019s new Virginia-class submarines.

However, if the existence of the country were really at stake, then it would become necessary to bring it back.\\n\\nSince the 1970s, the United States has had an All-Volunteer Force (AVF). From the beginning of the United States until the end of the Vietnam War, the country had always conscripted eligible male members of its population to fight\\u2014and win\\u2014the nation\\u2019s wars. Yet, the American experience in Vietnam broke the national consensus on the draft. Since then, policymakers have struggled to square public ambivalence about foreign intervention with what they\\u2019ve viewed as preserving the national interest.\\n\\nNixon was not alone in his support for an AVF. Many military leaders who had fought in Vietnam supported it, realizing that those who volunteered to serve and fight in a war were usually more effective in combat than those who were simply drafted into service. Despite the strategic failures of the AVF in Afghanistan and Iraq, most military leaders today insist upon preserving the AVF rather than institute conscription. The brilliant economist, Milton Friedman, hailed the creation of an AVF as a momentous step toward national progress. Friedman argued that a conscription force was ultimately one in which its members were slaves until the conflict ends (or they die). On the other hand, Friedman believed that an AVF was a military in which its members had their freedom preserved. The AVF has also fostered a degree of technological innovation that helped to keep the U.S. force smaller than it ordinarily would be\\u2014freeing up more Americans to, theoretically, become net contributors to America\\u2019s economic miracle. When the draft existed, it was created because warfare was a truly national endeavor. Today, we are told, wars are fought by small teams of elite professionals\\u2014like the Medieval knights of old. Should a great power conflict erupt, though, the age of specialization in warfare will go away, and total warfare will again be upon us again.\\n\\nCurrently, the U.S. defense budget is 4.2 percent of America\\u2019s overall GDP. While the defense budget in the United States is considerably higher than the defense budgets of its major rivals, it is at historic lows (it reached 15 percent of U.S. GDP during the Korean War). More importantly, less than one percent of the American population (1.29 million Americans) serves in the military. Further, in 2016, nearly one-in-five military deaths in Afghanistan were of private military contractors.\\n\\nNot only have private contractors augmented the U.S. AVF, but so too has technology. What the Chinese routinely refer to as \\u201cAmerican Magic\\u201d has become a force multiplier for that relatively small, expeditionary AVF. Satellites, airpower, cyber combat, drones, and a coterie of other technical assets have allowed for the relatively small U.S. military to punch above its weight. Yet, the U.S. military and its leaders have come to fetishize high-technology and rely far too much on it to make up for real weaknesses in its overall force structure. The w\\u00fcnderwaffe will not save U.S. forces when a world war starts. U.S. Policymakers today tend to forget that wars are still fought and won by men, not machines. American rivals have not forgotten this timeless truth.\\n\\nWhat few understand is that the AVF arose at a time when great interstate conflict was not a serious possibility. The enemies that the United States military fought against were usually insurgent-type forces engaged in various wars of liberation. Even during the Cold War, the Soviet Union\\u2019s direct threat to the United States was predominantly ideological, technological, and covert. Back then, the threat of an actual conflict erupting between the two superpowers was relatively low.\\n\\nToday, however, the chances for great state conflict are high. As the threat of interstate warfare increases, America\\u2019s small expeditionary force (which is wearing thin from decades of constant deployments) will be insufficient to meet the challenges that rival great powers, such as China or Russia, pose to the U.S. military. This is especially true, considering the focus of America\\u2019s enemies on depriving U.S. forces of their aforementioned technological advantages.\\n\\nAs I detail in the opening chapter of my forthcoming book, Winning Space: How America Remains a Superpower, which will be released in 2020 by the Republic Book Publishers, the first shots of another world war will be fired in space against America\\u2019s satellite constellations. From there, cyber and information warfare techniques will be used to sow chaos and degrade America\\u2019s resistance quotient\\u2014before U.S. military forces can even respond to an attack by either Russia or China. Once U.S. forces deploy, with their technological abilities stunted, they will then have to penetrate intense anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) bubbles where U.S. warplanes and transports will likely suffer high attrition rates if they move in too close.\\n\\nThis is where technologists will assert hypersonic weapons will be key. But, suppose the United States does not have a robust enough arsenal of hypersonic vehicles, how long does Washington wait for enough of those units to be built in order to retaliate against those who attack American forces?

Mark Cancian believes that \\u201cafter about nine months of intense peer conflict, attrition would grind the U.S. armed forces down to something resembling the military of a regional power.\\\" That is unless the United States can embrace a total warfare ethos\\u2014as it did in the world wars.\\n\\nSuch a total war, mind you, will devastate the world order. Premodern tribalism will quickly replace postmodern enlightenment\\u2014especially as the technological trappings of modernity were stripped away. The exchange of nuclear, not to mention biological and chemical, weapons will be a high probability as the combatants looked for leverage over one another, just as the Germans and Allies did with chemical weapons in the First World War, the longer that war ground on. This would especially be the case after early-warning missile satellites were knocked out in the opening phases of a space war. Being blind in the nuclear age is rarely good.\\n\\nVictory in a new world war would be Pyrrhic. What\\u2019s more, revolutionary politics in the countries of each combatant will likely become the norm, forever changing those societies, just as politics during the interwar years became radicalized. Remember: the rise of communism in Russia and fascism in the Axis Powers occurred in responses to the devastation of the First World War and the inevitable Great Depression that followed.\\n\\nU.S. policymakers should start planning now for the inevitable need to reconstitute the draft and should start anticipating how best to prepare for the demands placed upon its future force\\u2014and the country overall\\u2014in the event of another world war. When God told Noah to build the ark, he did not wait until the rain began. Similarly, U.S. policymakers have a moral duty to better prepare the country for the coming storm right now. A lack of planning will ensure the worst possible scenario befalls the United States when a great power war begins.\", \"author\": \"Brandon J.

That's propaganda favoring U.S. imperialism, which actually violates the intentions of America's Founders, and the spirit of the U.S. Constitution.The U.S. regime's propaganda doesn't come from the Government directly, but instead from the 607 billionaires who control the regime,financing their careers, and by their owning (and otherwise controlling) the regime's 'news'-media, which are privately owned and which carry the same propaganda as the Government's 'publicly owned' 'news'-media do \\u2014 all of America's mainstream 'news'-media being in favor of the U.S. Government's sanctioning (economic-blockading) and trying to overthrow by means of coup or sometimes outright invasion, countries (such as Iraq, Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Libya, etc.) that had never invaded, nor even threatened to invade, the United States. U.S. imperialism is commonly called \\\"neoconservatism,\\\" but it is basically the same as other imperialistic regimes throughout history \\u2014By means of these lies, the nation's public are made willing to fund these invasions in their taxes and can even think that it is their patriotic duty, instead of being a massively criminal enterprise that they've been fooled into supporting with their dollars and sometimes with their very bodies.First here will be essential historical background, in order for a reader to be able to understand typical U.S.-and-allied propaganda; and, then, will come a typical example which displays the results of that history and which thereby exposes the crucially implicit lies in that propaganda, and which cause it to be effective propaganda \\u2014 the sort of deceits that fool most of the public into favoring these invasions and other international aggressions, which aggressions routinely produce mass-murders, benefiting only the aggressor-nation's aristocracy and the aristocracies that are allied with them. This is the way that wealth in the U.S. has come to be so extremely narrowly held, so that, for example, a January 2018 study done for Deutsche Bank, \\\"US Income and Wealth Inequality\\\", reported (p. 9) that \\\"US: Top 0.1% owns as many assets as the bottom 90%\\\", and (p. 11) that, out of all the 34 OECD nations, America has the most unequal incomes \\u2014 the most extreme inequality, of them all. The billionaires and their agents say that this is okay because, as the wealthy economist Lawrence Summers once put it , \\\"we should accept inequality of results, recognizing that those who earn more are in a better position to contribute more to support society.\\\" (Rich people tend to believe that, and to reward economists such as Summer for teaching that. It's essential to their propaganda \\u2014 and they fool especially themselves into believing it.)The example to be dissected here will be from Wall Street's Michael Bloomberg. Though he doesn't deceive the public more than other billionaires do, he is running to become America's President in order to replace another deceptive billionaire, Donald Trump, and so his 'news'-operation provides a typical example of the mendacity of America's mainstream (that's to say, its billionaire-controlled) 'journalism' (virtually everything concerning international relations in U.S.-and-allied 'journalism' is propaganda: written so as to deceive).Washington DC and NYC both get their 'news' from such highly compromised, billionaires-owned-and-controlled, 'news'-media, as these. America's broadcast media then spread that 'news', nationally, and internationally.The individuals who report 'news' at a 'news'-medium such as Bloomberg 'News', do what the operation's owners and its advertisers want them to do, which is to propagandize for their aristocracy \\u2014 their own and allied billionaires' corporations' expansion so as to extend their empire into more countries and push aside the local aristocracy there, and, in this way, to concentrate the world's wealth into their own and allied corporations. An expansionist or \\\"imperialistic\\\" aristocracy's goals are analogous to gangland operations, except that. It creates laws within its own nation, and it creates laws also internationally via alliances and treaties, and it uses alliances and treaties against 'enemies', such as the military alliance and treaty organization NATO, in order to pump increased sales of their own nation's corporations' weaponry (such as from Raytheon Corporation), and it also uses those international laws via sanctions and secondary sanctions, which can become the preliminary phase of an outright military invasion of the targeted country after finally declaring the nation to be an 'enemy' and thus 'acceptable' to invade and take over, for 'us' against 'them'. (For example: Trump is outright refusing the demand by Iraq's sovereign Government for all U.S. forces to leave.) Mere gangsters cannot do any such things, and so they are much more under the gun than \\\"banksters\\\" (aristocrats and their agents) are.This is the difference between imperialistic operations versus organized-crime operations. Organized crime is lower-class because it doesn't control the government, but, when the anti-organized-crime Kennedy brothers were briefly in power in the U.S., organized crime did at least provide crucial assistance to eliminating the Kennedys; and, in that sense, organized crime was itself part of America's Establishment, at least at that time. Furthermore, as Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair documented in their classic 1998 WHITEOUT: The CIA, Drugs and the Press (p. 134),Organized crime is often essential to the CIA's \\\"Special Operations.\\\" Organizations such as the Mafia are valuable assets of the CIA. They are experts at getting things done secretly. And such operations are less likely than any other to ever be exposed as having been CIA operations. Organized crime is thus a terrific asset to international intelligence agencies \\u2014 especially to America's CIA, which promotes itself as representing a 'democracy', even though it represents, instead, a fascist-imperialist regime.Two years before the CIA got into protecting the heroin trade, U.S. President Harry S. Truman was, on 26 July 1945 , persuaded by his top general, Dwight David Eisenhower (hypocritical inventor of the PR phrase he used against the Establishment \\u2014 which he actually always supported \\u2014 \\\"military-industrial complex\\\") that if the United States wouldn't conquer the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union would conquer the United States, and so the suckered-by-Eisenhower Truman launched the Cold War on that date; and, on that basis, he turned America's most essential WW II ally, the Soviet Union, into an enemy, and the Cold War secretly remains U.S. policy till this very day. (This was exactly the opposite of what Truman's immediate predecessor, FDR, had intended.) The strategy, after U.S. President George Herbert Walker Bush (on 24 February 1990 ) secretly ordered America's leading vassals to continue the Cold War on the U.S.-and-allied side after the Soviet Union and its communism and their Warsaw-Pact mirror to America's NATO would all end the following year, has been to surround Russia with enemies (Russia-allied countries that would be flipped to become U.S.-allied countries, by means of CIA subversion coups , etc.), with the aim being ultimately to go in and conquer Russia . This plan requires a massive amount of propaganda , but it has been very successful, in ousting Russia-friendly governments such as in Yugoslavia in 1991-99, Iraq 2003, Libya 2011, and Ukraine 2014 , though not yet achieving its final destination, winning World War III (WW-III) by grabbing control over Russia itself The first CIA coup (these coups were done by their \\\"Special Operations\\\" division) was in Thailand in the second year of the CIA's existence, 1948, and it was done in order to take over the opium-heroin trade in southeast Asia (including Burma \\u2014 now Myanmar) and to use it for providing essential off-the-books finance to the CIA in order for the CIA to do its part of the job of conquering Russia, \\\"Special Operations.\\\" As WHITEOUT (p. 136) put it:That was how the \\\"The Buck Stops Here\\\" President, Truman, actually functioned. (Similarly, Hitler's \\\"signature was on no compromising document\\\" about the Holocaust, but, as I documented in my own 2000 WHY the Holocaust Happened, Hitler was the individual who ordered it \\u2014 that was an executive action from the very top. It wasn't any truer that Truman was a 'weak dictator' than that Hitler, whom some Hitler-supporters label with that phrase, was. However, there were important differences between them: Truman's impact turned out to shape subsequent history even more than Hitler's impact did. And, whereas Truman's vastly harmful impact resulted from his being the Deep State's fool and thus his starting the Cold War on 26 July 1945, Hitler's vastly harmful impact was from his own, very private and longstanding, personal and always secret obsession against \\\"blood-poisoning\\\" of pureblooded Christians or \\\"Aryans,\\\" by Jews, which had started obsessing him in him in 1919, twenty years before the war to impose this exterminationist goal upon the the entire world became publicly unveiled \\u2014 a war that he partly lost when WW II ended, whereas Truman's war already partly won in 1991, and continues on even now, with the U.S. regime still planning to go in for the final kill, if and when it ever can.)WHITEOUT also noted (p. 138) that,Furthermore,And (p. 225),So: that was the CIA's first coup, and it happened in 1948, to Thailand:Such Special Operations are crucial to the illegal, treasonous (anti-Constitutional), control over the U.S. Government, by the Deep State (the aristocrats \\u2014 America's hundreds of billionaires who finance the bulk of successful political campaigns for federal office; these are the individuals who determine who will and who won't be able to become a serious contender for Congress, the Presidency, and judgeships). Not all of the money to fund Special Operations comes from the billionaires. An unknown percentage of it comes also from organized criminals \\u2014 violators of laws, instead of writers of laws. America's billionaires (via their paid agents, including gangsters) are the ones who write the laws. Organized criminals aren't that powerful, because they can only violate the laws. And when a gangster serves a billionaire, only the billionaire is standing above the law. \\\"Putin's Grand Gas Project Makes Sense Now\\\" , by \\\"Opinion\\\" writer Leonid Bershidsky.Here, now, in, are the especially relevant excerpts from it which indicate Bloomberg's publication of propaganda that's against Russia, and for isolating Russia by overthrowing governments which (like Saddam Hussein's, Muammar Gaddafi's, Viktor Yanukovych's, Bashar Assad's, Nicol\\u00e1s Maduro's, and Evo Morales's) had (or have) friendly relations with Russia:This ignores that by no later than June of 2013, the U.S. regime was already at the early implementation stage of its planned take-over not only of all of Ukrainewhich since 1783 has been and still remains in Crimea (which from 1954 to 2014 was part of Ukraine). That was to become yet another U.S. naval base.So: that Bloomberg-published phrase \\\"the invader of Crimea\\\" belongs actually to Obama, instead of to Putin, who merely responded to that U.S. invasion of Ukraine in the way that was essential for the national security of Russia. In doing so, Russia's President Putin also was protecting the people who live in Crimea, which is why they passionately wanted this response from him.The Bloomberg-published phrase \\\"the armed conflict Russia has instigated in Ukraine's eastern regions\\\" refers actually to the Obama-installed new Ukrainian regime's ethnic cleansing in that region to eliminate as many of the residents there as possible, because 90+% of them had voted for the man whom Obama had just overthrown, Viktor Yanukovych; and, if those voters would still remain inside Ukraine, then Obama's new Ukrainian regime would easily be voted out of power and would thus quickly end. Obama's regime didn't want too many of those voters still to be living there if and when that area, called \\\"Donbass,\\\" would finally become restored to Ukraine and they would become Ukrainian voters again, because that would surely then lead to an end of America's control over Ukraine. The civilian population in Donbass were specifically targeted. Here's a map of the election in which Yanukovych became Ukraine's President, and as you can see there, the far-eastern dark purple area, where Yanukovych received at least 90% of the vote, is the \\\"eastern regions\\\" that refused to be ruled by the Obama-installed Ukrainian regime.The purpose of the newly installed Ukrainian Government's ethnic cleansing in that area wasn't only to kill as many people there as they could, but especially to force millions of them to flee across the border into Russia, so that, if and when that region would ever become restored again to Ukrainian control, as many voters as possible who had lived there would either have been killed or else become Russians and resettled in Russia.On 27 February 2006, David McClintick headlined a now-classic 20,000-word article in Institutional Investor magazine, \\\"How Harvard lost Russia\\\" , and he detailed there the rape of Russia in the early 1990s, by Lawrence Summers and his Harvard team of corrupt and deceiving economists, whom first Mikhail Gorbachev, and then Boris Yeltsin, naively brought in to guide Russia through the process of transforming from a communist to a capitalist economy. (Those two Russian leaders didn't understand fascism, and especially not its imperialistic type, such as Harvard and most of its ilk represent.) Basically, Summers, whose entire career has been spent assisting and helping America's billionaires, selected a team of advisors for this who when they weren't themselves outright corrupt, were nonetheless incredibly destructive in privatizing Russia's state-owned assets to Russia's most corrupt and well-connected insiders, who became billionaires in the process and secreted their newly gained wealth in London and elsewhere, so that the Russian Government's system of social-welfare benefits and of infrastructure were yanked out from under Russia's public.If you want to see in charts and graphs what the impact upon Russia has been from Putin's treating as criminals the most-corrupt of those Russian billionaires and his trying to get them to pay the taxes that they had avoided and hid abroad, click here . As is shown there,between 1990-2000 when Putin became President, who turned this around so that Russia has thrived under his leadership. Bershidsky wants to restore the pre-Putin type of leadership \\u2014 near-starvation to the Russian masses.Whereas Bloomberg 'News' pumps the lie about Putin's \\\"victims such as Ukraine,\\\" the clear and incontestable reality is that Barack Obama destroyed Ukraine in 2014, and that \\\"The Obama Regime's Plan to Seize the Russian Naval Base in Crimea\\\" started being implemented by the Obama Administration by no later than June 2013 \\u2014 well before his coup.The U.S. was backing an outright racist-fascist, or nazi, operation in Ukraine, as is clearly shown here and here . No one can reasonably assert that today's America isn't at least fascist, if not outright nazi (though predominantly anti-Russian instead of anti-Semitic, but any form of racist fascism is nazi ideology, and Obama's was a form of that: anti-Russian)., and those media \\u2014 as is exemplified well in this article from Bloomberg's Leonid Bershidsky \\u2014 base their international-'news' reporting, and analysis, on what is of benefit to America's billionaires, instead of to their victims, either at home or abroad. What type of fascists would produce such fascist propaganda? How is it not extreme? It's an extremist form of capitalism, of the most dangerous type: both racist and imperialist.Even most of the allegedly 'anti-war' or 'progressive' 'news'-media in America are actually pro-imperialistic , and the contrary front by them is itself part of their propaganda. Their function is to publish criticism of billionaires and of the Government, but nothing that would encourage any sort of revolution to eliminate the dictators (including their agents) and to replace them by a different system. In the United States, where the existing Constitution is democratic and the Government simply violates it routinely and the corrupt judges after 1970 have employed lies to label these clear violations 'constitutional', a revolution would need to eliminate the dictators but not the Constitution. In some other dictatorships, it would need to replace both, and replacing the system would thus have to be more drastic than merely replacing the existing rulers. Fortunately, that's not necessary in the United States; so, a bloodless revolution could restore America to democracy, though all post-1970 Constitutional rulings would need to be then reviewed by completely changed personnel in the U.S. Supreme Court, for possible reversal. In a bloodless revolution, changing all members would take decades; so, that process would have to start only after all other stages of such a revolution are already completed. It's possible, but unlikely. America will therefore probably remain a dictatorship by its richest. Though America's Founders sought not only to eliminate the British aristocracy here, but any subsequent aristocracy from ruling (even an American one) in the United States, America's richest did rise, after WW-II, to become America's aristocracy (now called America's \\\"Deep State\\\" ), and the U.S. Constitution will probably remain, and increasingly become, a dead letter here \\u2014 increasingly lied-about by America's top Court as it establishes more and more fraudulent precedents, which insult the consensus-intentions of the great men who wrote and signed the Constitution and each one of its Amendments.Even the Monroe Doctrine in 1823 (which is so often cited by American imperialists to 'justify' rapes and attempted rapes by the U.S. regime against countries in the Western Hemisphere such as Bolivia and Venezuela) was anti-imperialistic, and simply said that the United States opposed European countries' efforts to take over countries in the Western Hemisphere.\\u2014 yet another historical lie by the aristocracy. American fascism (especially of the imperialistic sort, which is commonly called now \\\"neoconservatism\\\") isrooted in the U.S. Constitution; itthe U.S. Constitution. Our current Government does not represent the United States of America (the U.S. Constitution \\u2014 \\\"We, the People ...\\\" \\u2014 and that's all Americans). But it does represent hundreds of today's Americans, the Deep State, which need to be eliminated and replaced so that this country becomes, again, a democracy.Other key sources, than the Cockburn-St.-Clair WHITEOUT , in order to understand today's U.S. Government, are:All of these describe the operation that agents of America's aristocrats carried out after FDR's 1945 death, in order, ultimately \\u2014 with the consciously planned ultimate aim being \\u2014 to surround Russia by enemies (transforming even its former allies into its enemies), and then to take control over both Russia and China, and thus to become dictators to the entire planet, nullifying U.S. President FDR's intention, which had been instead for an international democratic federal republic of nations emerging from the U.N. \\u2014 for the termination, instead of for the culmination, of all imperialisms.\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.sott.net/article/427994-Michael-Bloombergs-crew-of-journalists-propagandize-for-more-US-aggression\", \"published\": \"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 21:44:11 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580006651, \"collection_utc\": 1579999133}",News,1580006651

U.S. imperialism is commonly called \\\"neoconservatism,\\\" but it is basically the same as other imperialistic regimes throughout history \\u2014By means of these lies, the nation's public are made willing to fund these invasions in their taxes and can even think that it is their patriotic duty, instead of being a massively criminal enterprise that they've been fooled into supporting with their dollars and sometimes with their very bodies.First here will be essential historical background, in order for a reader to be able to understand typical U.S.-and-allied propaganda; and, then, will come a typical example which displays the results of that history and which thereby exposes the crucially implicit lies in that propaganda, and which cause it to be effective propaganda \\u2014 the sort of deceits that fool most of the public into favoring these invasions and other international aggressions, which aggressions routinely produce mass-murders, benefiting only the aggressor-nation's aristocracy and the aristocracies that are allied with them. This is the way that wealth in the U.S. has come to be so extremely narrowly held, so that, for example, a January 2018 study done for Deutsche Bank, \\\"US Income and Wealth Inequality\\\", reported (p. 9) that \\\"US: Top 0.1% owns as many assets as the bottom 90%\\\", and (p. 11) that, out of all the 34 OECD nations, America has the most unequal incomes \\u2014 the most extreme inequality, of them all.

(For example: Trump is outright refusing the demand by Iraq's sovereign Government for all U.S. forces to leave.) Mere gangsters cannot do any such things, and so they are much more under the gun than \\\"banksters\\\" (aristocrats and their agents) are.This is the difference between imperialistic operations versus organized-crime operations. Organized crime is lower-class because it doesn't control the government, but, when the anti-organized-crime Kennedy brothers were briefly in power in the U.S., organized crime did at least provide crucial assistance to eliminating the Kennedys; and, in that sense, organized crime was itself part of America's Establishment, at least at that time.

(Similarly, Hitler's \\\"signature was on no compromising document\\\" about the Holocaust, but, as I documented in my own 2000 WHY the Holocaust Happened, Hitler was the individual who ordered it \\u2014 that was an executive action from the very top. It wasn't any truer that Truman was a 'weak dictator' than that Hitler, whom some Hitler-supporters label with that phrase, was. However, there were important differences between them: Truman's impact turned out to shape subsequent history even more than Hitler's impact did. And, whereas Truman's vastly harmful impact resulted from his being the Deep State's fool and thus his starting the Cold War on 26 July 1945, Hitler's vastly harmful impact was from his own, very private and longstanding, personal and always secret obsession against \\\"blood-poisoning\\\" of pureblooded Christians or \\\"Aryans,\\\" by Jews, which had started obsessing him in him in 1919, twenty years before the war to impose this exterminationist goal upon the the entire world became publicly unveiled \\u2014 a war that he partly lost when WW II ended, whereas Truman's war already partly won in 1991, and continues on even now, with the U.S. regime still planning to go in for the final kill, if and when it ever can.)WHITEOUT also noted (p. 138) that,Furthermore,And (p. 225),So: that was the CIA's first coup, and it happened in 1948, to Thailand:Such Special Operations are crucial to the illegal, treasonous (anti-Constitutional), control over the U.S. Government, by the Deep State (the aristocrats \\u2014 America's hundreds of billionaires who finance the bulk of successful political campaigns for federal office; these are the individuals who determine who will and who won't be able to become a serious contender for Congress, the Presidency, and judgeships).

And when a gangster serves a billionaire, only the billionaire is standing above the law. \\\"Putin's Grand Gas Project Makes Sense Now\\\" , by \\\"Opinion\\\" writer Leonid Bershidsky.Here, now, in, are the especially relevant excerpts from it which indicate Bloomberg's publication of propaganda that's against Russia, and for isolating Russia by overthrowing governments which (like Saddam Hussein's, Muammar Gaddafi's, Viktor Yanukovych's, Bashar Assad's, Nicol\\u00e1s Maduro's, and Evo Morales's) had (or have) friendly relations with Russia:This ignores that by no later than June of 2013, the U.S. regime was already at the early implementation stage of its planned take-over not only of all of Ukrainewhich since 1783 has been and still remains in Crimea (which from 1954 to 2014 was part of Ukraine). That was to become yet another U.S. naval base.So: that Bloomberg-published phrase \\\"the invader of Crimea\\\" belongs actually to Obama, instead of to Putin, who merely responded to that U.S. invasion of Ukraine in the way that was essential for the national security of Russia. In doing so, Russia's President Putin also was protecting the people who live in Crimea, which is why they passionately wanted this response from him.The Bloomberg-published phrase \\\"the armed conflict Russia has instigated in Ukraine's eastern regions\\\" refers actually to the Obama-installed new Ukrainian regime's ethnic cleansing in that region to eliminate as many of the residents there as possible, because 90+% of them had voted for the man whom Obama had just overthrown, Viktor Yanukovych; and, if those voters would still remain inside Ukraine, then Obama's new Ukrainian regime would easily be voted out of power and would thus quickly end. Obama's regime didn't want too many of those voters still to be living there if and when that area, called \\\"Donbass,\\\" would finally become restored to Ukraine and they would become Ukrainian voters again, because that would surely then lead to an end of America's control over Ukraine. The civilian population in Donbass were specifically targeted. Here's a map of the election in which Yanukovych became Ukraine's President, and as you can see there, the far-eastern dark purple area, where Yanukovych received at least 90% of the vote, is the \\\"eastern regions\\\" that refused to be ruled by the Obama-installed Ukrainian regime.The purpose of the newly installed Ukrainian Government's ethnic cleansing in that area wasn't only to kill as many people there as they could, but especially to force millions of them to flee across the border into Russia, so that, if and when that region would ever become restored again to Ukrainian control, as many voters as possible who had lived there would either have been killed or else become Russians and resettled in Russia.On 27 February 2006, David McClintick headlined a now-classic 20,000-word article in Institutional Investor magazine, \\\"How Harvard lost Russia\\\" , and he detailed there the rape of Russia in the early 1990s, by Lawrence Summers and his Harvard team of corrupt and deceiving economists, whom first Mikhail Gorbachev, and then Boris Yeltsin, naively brought in to guide Russia through the process of transforming from a communist to a capitalist economy. (Those two Russian leaders didn't understand fascism, and especially not its imperialistic type, such as Harvard and most of its ilk represent.) Basically, Summers, whose entire career has been spent assisting and helping America's billionaires, selected a team of advisors for this who when they weren't themselves outright corrupt, were nonetheless incredibly destructive in privatizing Russia's state-owned assets to Russia's most corrupt and well-connected insiders, who became billionaires in the process and secreted their newly gained wealth in London and elsewhere, so that the Russian Government's system of social-welfare benefits and of infrastructure were yanked out from under Russia's public.If you want to see in charts and graphs what the impact upon Russia has been from Putin's treating as criminals the most-corrupt of those Russian billionaires and his trying to get them to pay the taxes that they had avoided and hid abroad, click here . As is shown there,between 1990-2000 when Putin became President, who turned this around so that Russia has thrived under his leadership. Bershidsky wants to restore the pre-Putin type of leadership \\u2014 near-starvation to the Russian masses.Whereas Bloomberg 'News' pumps the lie about Putin's \\\"victims such as Ukraine,\\\" the clear and incontestable reality is that Barack Obama destroyed Ukraine in 2014, and that \\\"The Obama Regime's Plan to Seize the Russian Naval Base in Crimea\\\" started being implemented by the Obama Administration by no later than June 2013 \\u2014 well before his coup.The U.S. was backing an outright racist-fascist, or nazi, operation in Ukraine, as is clearly shown here and here . No one can reasonably assert that today's America isn't at least fascist, if not outright nazi (though predominantly anti-Russian instead of anti-Semitic, but any form of racist fascism is nazi ideology, and Obama's was a form of that: anti-Russian)., and those media \\u2014 as is exemplified well in this article from Bloomberg's Leonid Bershidsky \\u2014 base their international-'news' reporting, and analysis, on what is of benefit to America's billionaires, instead of to their victims, either at home or abroad. What type of fascists would produce such fascist propaganda? How is it not extreme? It's an extremist form of capitalism, of the most dangerous type: both racist and imperialist.Even most of the allegedly 'anti-war' or 'progressive' 'news'-media in America are actually pro-imperialistic , and the contrary front by them is itself part of their propaganda. Their function is to publish criticism of billionaires and of the Government, but nothing that would encourage any sort of revolution to eliminate the dictators (including their agents) and to replace them by a different system. In the United States, where the existing Constitution is democratic and the Government simply violates it routinely and the corrupt judges after 1970 have employed lies to label these clear violations 'constitutional', a revolution would need to eliminate the dictators but not the Constitution. In some other dictatorships, it would need to replace both, and replacing the system would thus have to be more drastic than merely replacing the existing rulers. Fortunately, that's not necessary in the United States; so, a bloodless revolution could restore America to democracy, though all post-1970 Constitutional rulings would need to be then reviewed by completely changed personnel in the U.S. Supreme Court, for possible reversal. In a bloodless revolution, changing all members would take decades; so, that process would have to start only after all other stages of such a revolution are already completed. It's possible, but unlikely. America will therefore probably remain a dictatorship by its richest. Though America's Founders sought not only to eliminate the British aristocracy here, but any subsequent aristocracy from ruling (even an American one) in the United States, America's richest did rise, after WW-II, to become America's aristocracy (now called America's \\\"Deep State\\\" ), and the U.S. Constitution will probably remain, and increasingly become, a dead letter here \\u2014 increasingly lied-about by America's top Court as it establishes more and more fraudulent precedents, which insult the consensus-intentions of the great men who wrote and signed the Constitution and each one of its Amendments.Even the Monroe Doctrine in 1823 (which is so often cited by American imperialists to 'justify' rapes and attempted rapes by the U.S. regime against countries in the Western Hemisphere such as Bolivia and Venezuela) was anti-imperialistic, and simply said that the United States opposed European countries' efforts to take over countries in the Western Hemisphere.\\u2014 yet another historical lie by the aristocracy. American fascism (especially of the imperialistic sort, which is commonly called now \\\"neoconservatism\\\") isrooted in the U.S. Constitution; itthe U.S. Constitution. Our current Government does not represent the United States of America (the U.S. Constitution \\u2014 \\\"We, the People ...\\\" \\u2014 and that's all Americans). But it does represent hundreds of today's Americans, the Deep State, which need to be eliminated and replaced so that this country becomes, again, a democracy.Other key sources, than the Cockburn-St.-Clair WHITEOUT , in order to understand today's U.S. Government, are:All of these describe the operation that agents of America's aristocrats carried out after FDR's 1945 death, in order, ultimately \\u2014 with the consciously planned ultimate aim being \\u2014 to surround Russia by enemies (transforming even its former allies into its enemies), and then to take control over both Russia and China, and thus to become dictators to the entire planet, nullifying U.S. President FDR's intention, which had been instead for an international democratic federal republic of nations emerging from the U.N. \\u2014 for the termination, instead of for the culmination, of all imperialisms.\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.sott.net/article/427994-Michael-Bloombergs-crew-of-journalists-propagandize-for-more-US-aggression\", \"published\": \"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 21:44:11 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580006651, \"collection_utc\": 1579999133}",News,1580006651

That's propaganda favoring U.S. imperialism, which actually violates the intentions of America's Founders, and the spirit of the U.S. Constitution.The U.S. regime's propaganda doesn't come from the Government directly, but instead from the 607 billionaires who control the regime,financing their careers, and by their owning (and otherwise controlling) the regime's 'news'-media, which are privately owned and which carry the same propaganda as the Government's 'publicly owned' 'news'-media do \\u2014 all of America's mainstream 'news'-media being in favor of the U.S. Government's sanctioning (economic-blockading) and trying to overthrow by means of coup or sometimes outright invasion, countries (such as Iraq, Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Libya, etc.) that had never invaded, nor even threatened to invade, the United States. U.S. imperialism is commonly called \\\"neoconservatism,\\\" but it is basically the same as other imperialistic regimes throughout history \\u2014By means of these lies, the nation's public are made willing to fund these invasions in their taxes and can even think that it is their patriotic duty, instead of being a massively criminal enterprise that they've been fooled into supporting with their dollars and sometimes with their very bodies.First here will be essential historical background, in order for a reader to be able to understand typical U.S.-and-allied propaganda; and, then, will come a typical example which displays the results of that history and which thereby exposes the crucially implicit lies in that propaganda, and which cause it to be effective propaganda \\u2014 the sort of deceits that fool most of the public into favoring these invasions and other international aggressions, which aggressions routinely produce mass-murders, benefiting only the aggressor-nation's aristocracy and the aristocracies that are allied with them. This is the way that wealth in the U.S. has come to be so extremely narrowly held, so that, for example, a January 2018 study done for Deutsche Bank, \\\"US Income and Wealth Inequality\\\", reported (p. 9) that \\\"US: Top 0.1% owns as many assets as the bottom 90%\\\", and (p. 11) that, out of all the 34 OECD nations, America has the most unequal incomes \\u2014 the most extreme inequality, of them all. The billionaires and their agents say that this is okay because, as the wealthy economist Lawrence Summers once put it , \\\"we should accept inequality of results, recognizing that those who earn more are in a better position to contribute more to support society.\\\" (Rich people tend to believe that, and to reward economists such as Summer for teaching that. It's essential to their propaganda \\u2014 and they fool especially themselves into believing it.)The example to be dissected here will be from Wall Street's Michael Bloomberg. Though he doesn't deceive the public more than other billionaires do, he is running to become America's President in order to replace another deceptive billionaire, Donald Trump, and so his 'news'-operation provides a typical example of the mendacity of America's mainstream (that's to say, its billionaire-controlled) 'journalism' (virtually everything concerning international relations in U.S.-and-allied 'journalism' is propaganda: written so as to deceive).Washington DC and NYC both get their 'news' from such highly compromised, billionaires-owned-and-controlled, 'news'-media, as these. America's broadcast media then spread that 'news', nationally, and internationally.The individuals who report 'news' at a 'news'-medium such as Bloomberg 'News', do what the operation's owners and its advertisers want them to do, which is to propagandize for their aristocracy \\u2014 their own and allied billionaires' corporations' expansion so as to extend their empire into more countries and push aside the local aristocracy there, and, in this way, to concentrate the world's wealth into their own and allied corporations. An expansionist or \\\"imperialistic\\\" aristocracy's goals are analogous to gangland operations, except that. It creates laws within its own nation, and it creates laws also internationally via alliances and treaties, and it uses alliances and treaties against 'enemies', such as the military alliance and treaty organization NATO, in order to pump increased sales of their own nation's corporations' weaponry (such as from Raytheon Corporation), and it also uses those international laws via sanctions and secondary sanctions, which can become the preliminary phase of an outright military invasion of the targeted country after finally declaring the nation to be an 'enemy' and thus 'acceptable' to invade and take over, for 'us' against 'them'. (For example: Trump is outright refusing the demand by Iraq's sovereign Government for all U.S. forces to leave.) Mere gangsters cannot do any such things, and so they are much more under the gun than \\\"banksters\\\" (aristocrats and their agents) are.This is the difference between imperialistic operations versus organized-crime operations. Organized crime is lower-class because it doesn't control the government, but, when the anti-organized-crime Kennedy brothers were briefly in power in the U.S., organized crime did at least provide crucial assistance to eliminating the Kennedys; and, in that sense, organized crime was itself part of America's Establishment, at least at that time. Furthermore, as Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair documented in their classic 1998 WHITEOUT: The CIA, Drugs and the Press (p. 134),Organized crime is often essential to the CIA's \\\"Special Operations.\\\" Organizations such as the Mafia are valuable assets of the CIA. They are experts at getting things done secretly. And such operations are less likely than any other to ever be exposed as having been CIA operations. Organized crime is thus a terrific asset to international intelligence agencies \\u2014 especially to America's CIA, which promotes itself as representing a 'democracy', even though it represents, instead, a fascist-imperialist regime.Two years before the CIA got into protecting the heroin trade, U.S. President Harry S. Truman was, on 26 July 1945 , persuaded by his top general, Dwight David Eisenhower (hypocritical inventor of the PR phrase he used against the Establishment \\u2014 which he actually always supported \\u2014 \\\"military-industrial complex\\\") that if the United States wouldn't conquer the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union would conquer the United States, and so the suckered-by-Eisenhower Truman launched the Cold War on that date; and, on that basis, he turned America's most essential WW II ally, the Soviet Union, into an enemy, and the Cold War secretly remains U.S. policy till this very day. (This was exactly the opposite of what Truman's immediate predecessor, FDR, had intended.) The strategy, after U.S. President George Herbert Walker Bush (on 24 February 1990 ) secretly ordered America's leading vassals to continue the Cold War on the U.S.-and-allied side after the Soviet Union and its communism and their Warsaw-Pact mirror to America's NATO would all end the following year, has been to surround Russia with enemies (Russia-allied countries that would be flipped to become U.S.-allied countries, by means of CIA subversion coups , etc.), with the aim being ultimately to go in and conquer Russia . This plan requires a massive amount of propaganda , but it has been very successful, in ousting Russia-friendly governments such as in Yugoslavia in 1991-99, Iraq 2003, Libya 2011, and Ukraine 2014 , though not yet achieving its final destination, winning World War III (WW-III) by grabbing control over Russia itself The first CIA coup (these coups were done by their \\\"Special Operations\\\" division) was in Thailand in the second year of the CIA's existence, 1948, and it was done in order to take over the opium-heroin trade in southeast Asia (including Burma \\u2014 now Myanmar) and to use it for providing essential off-the-books finance to the CIA in order for the CIA to do its part of the job of conquering Russia, \\\"Special Operations.\\\" As WHITEOUT (p. 136) put it:That was how the \\\"The Buck Stops Here\\\" President, Truman, actually functioned. (Similarly, Hitler's \\\"signature was on no compromising document\\\" about the Holocaust, but, as I documented in my own 2000 WHY the Holocaust Happened, Hitler was the individual who ordered it \\u2014 that was an executive action from the very top. It wasn't any truer that Truman was a 'weak dictator' than that Hitler, whom some Hitler-supporters label with that phrase, was. However, there were important differences between them: Truman's impact turned out to shape subsequent history even more than Hitler's impact did. And, whereas Truman's vastly harmful impact resulted from his being the Deep State's fool and thus his starting the Cold War on 26 July 1945, Hitler's vastly harmful impact was from his own, very private and longstanding, personal and always secret obsession against \\\"blood-poisoning\\\" of pureblooded Christians or \\\"Aryans,\\\" by Jews, which had started obsessing him in him in 1919, twenty years before the war to impose this exterminationist goal upon the the entire world became publicly unveiled \\u2014 a war that he partly lost when WW II ended, whereas Truman's war already partly won in 1991, and continues on even now, with the U.S. regime still planning to go in for the final kill, if and when it ever can.)WHITEOUT also noted (p. 138) that,Furthermore,And (p. 225),So: that was the CIA's first coup, and it happened in 1948, to Thailand:Such Special Operations are crucial to the illegal, treasonous (anti-Constitutional), control over the U.S. Government, by the Deep State (the aristocrats \\u2014 America's hundreds of billionaires who finance the bulk of successful political campaigns for federal office; these are the individuals who determine who will and who won't be able to become a serious contender for Congress, the Presidency, and judgeships). Not all of the money to fund Special Operations comes from the billionaires. An unknown percentage of it comes also from organized criminals \\u2014 violators of laws, instead of writers of laws. America's billionaires (via their paid agents, including gangsters) are the ones who write the laws. Organized criminals aren't that powerful, because they can only violate the laws. And when a gangster serves a billionaire, only the billionaire is standing above the law. \\\"Putin's Grand Gas Project Makes Sense Now\\\" , by \\\"Opinion\\\" writer Leonid Bershidsky.Here, now, in, are the especially relevant excerpts from it which indicate Bloomberg's publication of propaganda that's against Russia, and for isolating Russia by overthrowing governments which (like Saddam Hussein's, Muammar Gaddafi's, Viktor Yanukovych's, Bashar Assad's, Nicol\\u00e1s Maduro's, and Evo Morales's) had (or have) friendly relations with Russia:This ignores that by no later than June of 2013, the U.S. regime was already at the early implementation stage of its planned take-over not only of all of Ukrainewhich since 1783 has been and still remains in Crimea (which from 1954 to 2014 was part of Ukraine).

The billionaires and their agents say that this is okay because, as the wealthy economist Lawrence Summers once put it , \\\"we should accept inequality of results, recognizing that those who earn more are in a better position to contribute more to support society.\\\" (Rich people tend to believe that, and to reward economists such as Summer for teaching that. It's essential to their propaganda \\u2014 and they fool especially themselves into believing it.)The example to be dissected here will be from Wall Street's Michael Bloomberg. Though he doesn't deceive the public more than other billionaires do, he is running to become America's President in order to replace another deceptive billionaire, Donald Trump, and so his 'news'-operation provides a typical example of the mendacity of America's mainstream (that's to say, its billionaire-controlled) 'journalism' (virtually everything concerning international relations in U.S.-and-allied 'journalism' is propaganda: written so as to deceive).Washington DC and NYC both get their 'news' from such highly compromised, billionaires-owned-and-controlled, 'news'-media, as these. America's broadcast media then spread that 'news', nationally, and internationally.The individuals who report 'news' at a 'news'-medium such as Bloomberg 'News', do what the operation's owners and its advertisers want them to do, which is to propagandize for their aristocracy \\u2014 their own and allied billionaires' corporations' expansion so as to extend their empire into more countries and push aside the local aristocracy there, and, in this way, to concentrate the world's wealth into their own and allied corporations. An expansionist or \\\"imperialistic\\\" aristocracy's goals are analogous to gangland operations, except that. It creates laws within its own nation, and it creates laws also internationally via alliances and treaties, and it uses alliances and treaties against 'enemies', such as the military alliance and treaty organization NATO, in order to pump increased sales of their own nation's corporations' weaponry (such as from Raytheon Corporation), and it also uses those international laws via sanctions and secondary sanctions, which can become the preliminary phase of an outright military invasion of the targeted country after finally declaring the nation to be an 'enemy' and thus 'acceptable' to invade and take over, for 'us' against 'them'. (For example: Trump is outright refusing the demand by Iraq's sovereign Government for all U.S. forces to leave.) Mere gangsters cannot do any such things, and so they are much more under the gun than \\\"banksters\\\" (aristocrats and their agents) are.This is the difference between imperialistic operations versus organized-crime operations. Organized crime is lower-class because it doesn't control the government, but, when the anti-organized-crime Kennedy brothers were briefly in power in the U.S., organized crime did at least provide crucial assistance to eliminating the Kennedys; and, in that sense, organized crime was itself part of America's Establishment, at least at that time. Furthermore, as Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair documented in their classic 1998 WHITEOUT: The CIA, Drugs and the Press (p. 134),Organized crime is often essential to the CIA's \\\"Special Operations.\\\" Organizations such as the Mafia are valuable assets of the CIA. They are experts at getting things done secretly. And such operations are less likely than any other to ever be exposed as having been CIA operations. Organized crime is thus a terrific asset to international intelligence agencies \\u2014 especially to America's CIA, which promotes itself as representing a 'democracy', even though it represents, instead, a fascist-imperialist regime.Two years before the CIA got into protecting the heroin trade, U.S. President Harry S. Truman was, on 26 July 1945 , persuaded by his top general, Dwight David Eisenhower (hypocritical inventor of the PR phrase he used against the Establishment \\u2014 which he actually always supported \\u2014 \\\"military-industrial complex\\\") that if the United States wouldn't conquer the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union would conquer the United States, and so the suckered-by-Eisenhower Truman launched the Cold War on that date; and, on that basis, he turned America's most essential WW II ally, the Soviet Union, into an enemy, and the Cold War secretly remains U.S. policy till this very day. (This was exactly the opposite of what Truman's immediate predecessor, FDR, had intended.) The strategy, after U.S. President George Herbert Walker Bush (on 24 February 1990 ) secretly ordered America's leading vassals to continue the Cold War on the U.S.-and-allied side after the Soviet Union and its communism and their Warsaw-Pact mirror to America's NATO would all end the following year, has been to surround Russia with enemies (Russia-allied countries that would be flipped to become U.S.-allied countries, by means of CIA subversion coups , etc.), with the aim being ultimately to go in and conquer Russia . This plan requires a massive amount of propaganda , but it has been very successful, in ousting Russia-friendly governments such as in Yugoslavia in 1991-99, Iraq 2003, Libya 2011, and Ukraine 2014 , though not yet achieving its final destination, winning World War III (WW-III) by grabbing control over Russia itself The first CIA coup (these coups were done by their \\\"Special Operations\\\" division) was in Thailand in the second year of the CIA's existence, 1948, and it was done in order to take over the opium-heroin trade in southeast Asia (including Burma \\u2014 now Myanmar) and to use it for providing essential off-the-books finance to the CIA in order for the CIA to do its part of the job of conquering Russia, \\\"Special Operations.\\\" As WHITEOUT (p. 136) put it:That was how the \\\"The Buck Stops Here\\\" President, Truman, actually functioned. (Similarly, Hitler's \\\"signature was on no compromising document\\\" about the Holocaust, but, as I documented in my own 2000 WHY the Holocaust Happened, Hitler was the individual who ordered it \\u2014 that was an executive action from the very top. It wasn't any truer that Truman was a 'weak dictator' than that Hitler, whom some Hitler-supporters label with that phrase, was. However, there were important differences between them: Truman's impact turned out to shape subsequent history even more than Hitler's impact did. And, whereas Truman's vastly harmful impact resulted from his being the Deep State's fool and thus his starting the Cold War on 26 July 1945, Hitler's vastly harmful impact was from his own, very private and longstanding, personal and always secret obsession against \\\"blood-poisoning\\\" of pureblooded Christians or \\\"Aryans,\\\" by Jews, which had started obsessing him in him in 1919, twenty years before the war to impose this exterminationist goal upon the the entire world became publicly unveiled \\u2014 a war that he partly lost when WW II ended, whereas Truman's war already partly won in 1991, and continues on even now, with the U.S. regime still planning to go in for the final kill, if and when it ever can.)WHITEOUT also noted (p. 138) that,Furthermore,And (p. 225),So: that was the CIA's first coup, and it happened in 1948, to Thailand:Such Special Operations are crucial to the illegal, treasonous (anti-Constitutional), control over the U.S. Government, by the Deep State (the aristocrats \\u2014 America's hundreds of billionaires who finance the bulk of successful political campaigns for federal office; these are the individuals who determine who will and who won't be able to become a serious contender for Congress, the Presidency, and judgeships). Not all of the money to fund Special Operations comes from the billionaires. An unknown percentage of it comes also from organized criminals \\u2014 violators of laws, instead of writers of laws. America's billionaires (via their paid agents, including gangsters) are the ones who write the laws. Organized criminals aren't that powerful, because they can only violate the laws. And when a gangster serves a billionaire, only the billionaire is standing above the law. \\\"Putin's Grand Gas Project Makes Sense Now\\\" , by \\\"Opinion\\\" writer Leonid Bershidsky.Here, now, in, are the especially relevant excerpts from it which indicate Bloomberg's publication of propaganda that's against Russia, and for isolating Russia by overthrowing governments which (like Saddam Hussein's, Muammar Gaddafi's, Viktor Yanukovych's, Bashar Assad's, Nicol\\u00e1s Maduro's, and Evo Morales's) had (or have) friendly relations with Russia:This ignores that by no later than June of 2013, the U.S. regime was already at the early implementation stage of its planned take-over not only of all of Ukrainewhich since 1783 has been and still remains in Crimea (which from 1954 to 2014 was part of Ukraine). That was to become yet another U.S. naval base.So: that Bloomberg-published phrase \\\"the invader of Crimea\\\" belongs actually to Obama, instead of to Putin, who merely responded to that U.S. invasion of Ukraine in the way that was essential for the national security of Russia. In doing so, Russia's President Putin also was protecting the people who live in Crimea, which is why they passionately wanted this response from him.The Bloomberg-published phrase \\\"the armed conflict Russia has instigated in Ukraine's eastern regions\\\" refers actually to the Obama-installed new Ukrainian regime's ethnic cleansing in that region to eliminate as many of the residents there as possible, because 90+% of them had voted for the man whom Obama had just overthrown, Viktor Yanukovych; and, if those voters would still remain inside Ukraine, then Obama's new Ukrainian regime would easily be voted out of power and would thus quickly end. Obama's regime didn't want too many of those voters still to be living there if and when that area, called \\\"Donbass,\\\" would finally become restored to Ukraine and they would become Ukrainian voters again, because that would surely then lead to an end of America's control over Ukraine. The civilian population in Donbass were specifically targeted. Here's a map of the election in which Yanukovych became Ukraine's President, and as you can see there, the far-eastern dark purple area, where Yanukovych received at least 90% of the vote, is the \\\"eastern regions\\\" that refused to be ruled by the Obama-installed Ukrainian regime.The purpose of the newly installed Ukrainian Government's ethnic cleansing in that area wasn't only to kill as many people there as they could, but especially to force millions of them to flee across the border into Russia, so that, if and when that region would ever become restored again to Ukrainian control, as many voters as possible who had lived there would either have been killed or else become Russians and resettled in Russia.On 27 February 2006, David McClintick headlined a now-classic 20,000-word article in Institutional Investor magazine, \\\"How Harvard lost Russia\\\" , and he detailed there the rape of Russia in the early 1990s, by Lawrence Summers and his Harvard team of corrupt and deceiving economists, whom first Mikhail Gorbachev, and then Boris Yeltsin, naively brought in to guide Russia through the process of transforming from a communist to a capitalist economy. (Those two Russian leaders didn't understand fascism, and especially not its imperialistic type, such as Harvard and most of its ilk represent.) Basically, Summers, whose entire career has been spent assisting and helping America's billionaires, selected a team of advisors for this who when they weren't themselves outright corrupt, were nonetheless incredibly destructive in privatizing Russia's state-owned assets to Russia's most corrupt and well-connected insiders, who became billionaires in the process and secreted their newly gained wealth in London and elsewhere, so that the Russian Government's system of social-welfare benefits and of infrastructure were yanked out from under Russia's public.If you want to see in charts and graphs what the impact upon Russia has been from Putin's treating as criminals the most-corrupt of those Russian billionaires and his trying to get them to pay the taxes that they had avoided and hid abroad, click here . As is shown there,between 1990-2000 when Putin became President, who turned this around so that Russia has thrived under his leadership. Bershidsky wants to restore the pre-Putin type of leadership \\u2014 near-starvation to the Russian masses.Whereas Bloomberg 'News' pumps the lie about Putin's \\\"victims such as Ukraine,\\\" the clear and incontestable reality is that Barack Obama destroyed Ukraine in 2014, and that \\\"The Obama Regime's Plan to Seize the Russian Naval Base in Crimea\\\" started being implemented by the Obama Administration by no later than June 2013 \\u2014 well before his coup.The U.S. was backing an outright racist-fascist, or nazi, operation in Ukraine, as is clearly shown here and here . No one can reasonably assert that today's America isn't at least fascist, if not outright nazi (though predominantly anti-Russian instead of anti-Semitic, but any form of racist fascism is nazi ideology, and Obama's was a form of that: anti-Russian)., and those media \\u2014 as is exemplified well in this article from Bloomberg's Leonid Bershidsky \\u2014 base their international-'news' reporting, and analysis, on what is of benefit to America's billionaires, instead of to their victims, either at home or abroad. What type of fascists would produce such fascist propaganda? How is it not extreme? It's an extremist form of capitalism, of the most dangerous type: both racist and imperialist.Even most of the allegedly 'anti-war' or 'progressive' 'news'-media in America are actually pro-imperialistic , and the contrary front by them is itself part of their propaganda. Their function is to publish criticism of billionaires and of the Government, but nothing that would encourage any sort of revolution to eliminate the dictators (including their agents) and to replace them by a different system. In the United States, where the existing Constitution is democratic and the Government simply violates it routinely and the corrupt judges after 1970 have employed lies to label these clear violations 'constitutional', a revolution would need to eliminate the dictators but not the Constitution. In some other dictatorships, it would need to replace both, and replacing the system would thus have to be more drastic than merely replacing the existing rulers. Fortunately, that's not necessary in the United States; so, a bloodless revolution could restore America to democracy, though all post-1970 Constitutional rulings would need to be then reviewed by completely changed personnel in the U.S. Supreme Court, for possible reversal. In a bloodless revolution, changing all members would take decades; so, that process would have to start only after all other stages of such a revolution are already completed. It's possible, but unlikely. America will therefore probably remain a dictatorship by its richest. Though America's Founders sought not only to eliminate the British aristocracy here, but any subsequent aristocracy from ruling (even an American one) in the United States, America's richest did rise, after WW-II, to become America's aristocracy (now called America's \\\"Deep State\\\" ), and the U.S. Constitution will probably remain, and increasingly become, a dead letter here \\u2014 increasingly lied-about by America's top Court as it establishes more and more fraudulent precedents, which insult the consensus-intentions of the great men who wrote and signed the Constitution and each one of its Amendments.Even the Monroe Doctrine in 1823 (which is so often cited by American imperialists to 'justify' rapes and attempted rapes by the U.S. regime against countries in the Western Hemisphere such as Bolivia and Venezuela) was anti-imperialistic, and simply said that the United States opposed European countries' efforts to take over countries in the Western Hemisphere.\\u2014 yet another historical lie by the aristocracy. American fascism (especially of the imperialistic sort, which is commonly called now \\\"neoconservatism\\\") isrooted in the U.S. Constitution; itthe U.S. Constitution. Our current Government does not represent the United States of America (the U.S. Constitution \\u2014 \\\"We, the People ...\\\" \\u2014 and that's all Americans). But it does represent hundreds of today's Americans, the Deep State, which need to be eliminated and replaced so that this country becomes, again, a democracy.Other key sources, than the Cockburn-St.-Clair WHITEOUT , in order to understand today's U.S. Government, are:All of these describe the operation that agents of America's aristocrats carried out after FDR's 1945 death, in order, ultimately \\u2014 with the consciously planned ultimate aim being \\u2014 to surround Russia by enemies (transforming even its former allies into its enemies), and then to take control over both Russia and China, and thus to become dictators to the entire planet, nullifying U.S. President FDR's intention, which had been instead for an international democratic federal republic of nations emerging from the U.N. \\u2014 for the termination, instead of for the culmination, of all imperialisms.\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.sott.net/article/427994-Michael-Bloombergs-crew-of-journalists-propagandize-for-more-US-aggression\", \"published\": \"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 21:44:11 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580006651, \"collection_utc\": 1579999133}",News,1580006651

That's propaganda favoring U.S. imperialism, which actually violates the intentions of America's Founders, and the spirit of the U.S. Constitution.The U.S. regime's propaganda doesn't come from the Government directly, but instead from the 607 billionaires who control the regime,financing their careers, and by their owning (and otherwise controlling) the regime's 'news'-media, which are privately owned and which carry the same propaganda as the Government's 'publicly owned' 'news'-media do \\u2014 all of America's mainstream 'news'-media being in favor of the U.S. Government's sanctioning (economic-blockading) and trying to overthrow by means of coup or sometimes outright invasion, countries (such as Iraq, Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Libya, etc.) that had never invaded, nor even threatened to invade, the United States. U.S. imperialism is commonly called \\\"neoconservatism,\\\" but it is basically the same as other imperialistic regimes throughout history \\u2014By means of these lies, the nation's public are made willing to fund these invasions in their taxes and can even think that it is their patriotic duty, instead of being a massively criminal enterprise that they've been fooled into supporting with their dollars and sometimes with their very bodies.First here will be essential historical background, in order for a reader to be able to understand typical U.S.-and-allied propaganda; and, then, will come a typical example which displays the results of that history and which thereby exposes the crucially implicit lies in that propaganda, and which cause it to be effective propaganda \\u2014 the sort of deceits that fool most of the public into favoring these invasions and other international aggressions, which aggressions routinely produce mass-murders, benefiting only the aggressor-nation's aristocracy and the aristocracies that are allied with them. This is the way that wealth in the U.S. has come to be so extremely narrowly held, so that, for example, a January 2018 study done for Deutsche Bank, \\\"US Income and Wealth Inequality\\\", reported (p. 9) that \\\"US: Top 0.1% owns as many assets as the bottom 90%\\\", and (p. 11) that, out of all the 34 OECD nations, America has the most unequal incomes \\u2014 the most extreme inequality, of them all. The billionaires and their agents say that this is okay because, as the wealthy economist Lawrence Summers once put it , \\\"we should accept inequality of results, recognizing that those who earn more are in a better position to contribute more to support society.\\\" (Rich people tend to believe that, and to reward economists such as Summer for teaching that. It's essential to their propaganda \\u2014 and they fool especially themselves into believing it.)The example to be dissected here will be from Wall Street's Michael Bloomberg. Though he doesn't deceive the public more than other billionaires do, he is running to become America's President in order to replace another deceptive billionaire, Donald Trump, and so his 'news'-operation provides a typical example of the mendacity of America's mainstream (that's to say, its billionaire-controlled) 'journalism' (virtually everything concerning international relations in U.S.-and-allied 'journalism' is propaganda: written so as to deceive).Washington DC and NYC both get their 'news' from such highly compromised, billionaires-owned-and-controlled, 'news'-media, as these. America's broadcast media then spread that 'news', nationally, and internationally.The individuals who report 'news' at a 'news'-medium such as Bloomberg 'News', do what the operation's owners and its advertisers want them to do, which is to propagandize for their aristocracy \\u2014 their own and allied billionaires' corporations' expansion so as to extend their empire into more countries and push aside the local aristocracy there, and, in this way, to concentrate the world's wealth into their own and allied corporations. An expansionist or \\\"imperialistic\\\" aristocracy's goals are analogous to gangland operations, except that. It creates laws within its own nation, and it creates laws also internationally via alliances and treaties, and it uses alliances and treaties against 'enemies', such as the military alliance and treaty organization NATO, in order to pump increased sales of their own nation's corporations' weaponry (such as from Raytheon Corporation), and it also uses those international laws via sanctions and secondary sanctions, which can become the preliminary phase of an outright military invasion of the targeted country after finally declaring the nation to be an 'enemy' and thus 'acceptable' to invade and take over, for 'us' against 'them'. (For example: Trump is outright refusing the demand by Iraq's sovereign Government for all U.S. forces to leave.) Mere gangsters cannot do any such things, and so they are much more under the gun than \\\"banksters\\\" (aristocrats and their agents) are.This is the difference between imperialistic operations versus organized-crime operations. Organized crime is lower-class because it doesn't control the government, but, when the anti-organized-crime Kennedy brothers were briefly in power in the U.S., organized crime did at least provide crucial assistance to eliminating the Kennedys; and, in that sense, organized crime was itself part of America's Establishment, at least at that time. Furthermore, as Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair documented in their classic 1998 WHITEOUT: The CIA, Drugs and the Press (p. 134),Organized crime is often essential to the CIA's \\\"Special Operations.\\\" Organizations such as the Mafia are valuable assets of the CIA. They are experts at getting things done secretly. And such operations are less likely than any other to ever be exposed as having been CIA operations. Organized crime is thus a terrific asset to international intelligence agencies \\u2014 especially to America's CIA, which promotes itself as representing a 'democracy', even though it represents, instead, a fascist-imperialist regime.Two years before the CIA got into protecting the heroin trade, U.S. President Harry S. Truman was, on 26 July 1945 , persuaded by his top general, Dwight David Eisenhower (hypocritical inventor of the PR phrase he used against the Establishment \\u2014 which he actually always supported \\u2014 \\\"military-industrial complex\\\") that if the United States wouldn't conquer the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union would conquer the United States, and so the suckered-by-Eisenhower Truman launched the Cold War on that date; and, on that basis, he turned America's most essential WW II ally, the Soviet Union, into an enemy, and the Cold War secretly remains U.S. policy till this very day. (This was exactly the opposite of what Truman's immediate predecessor, FDR, had intended.) The strategy, after U.S. President George Herbert Walker Bush (on 24 February 1990 ) secretly ordered America's leading vassals to continue the Cold War on the U.S.-and-allied side after the Soviet Union and its communism and their Warsaw-Pact mirror to America's NATO would all end the following year, has been to surround Russia with enemies (Russia-allied countries that would be flipped to become U.S.-allied countries, by means of CIA subversion coups , etc.), with the aim being ultimately to go in and conquer Russia . This plan requires a massive amount of propaganda , but it has been very successful, in ousting Russia-friendly governments such as in Yugoslavia in 1991-99, Iraq 2003, Libya 2011, and Ukraine 2014 , though not yet achieving its final destination, winning World War III (WW-III) by grabbing control over Russia itself The first CIA coup (these coups were done by their \\\"Special Operations\\\" division) was in Thailand in the second year of the CIA's existence, 1948, and it was done in order to take over the opium-heroin trade in southeast Asia (including Burma \\u2014 now Myanmar) and to use it for providing essential off-the-books finance to the CIA in order for the CIA to do its part of the job of conquering Russia, \\\"Special Operations.\\\" As WHITEOUT (p. 136) put it:That was how the \\\"The Buck Stops Here\\\" President, Truman, actually functioned. (Similarly, Hitler's \\\"signature was on no compromising document\\\" about the Holocaust, but, as I documented in my own 2000 WHY the Holocaust Happened, Hitler was the individual who ordered it \\u2014 that was an executive action from the very top. It wasn't any truer that Truman was a 'weak dictator' than that Hitler, whom some Hitler-supporters label with that phrase, was. However, there were important differences between them: Truman's impact turned out to shape subsequent history even more than Hitler's impact did. And, whereas Truman's vastly harmful impact resulted from his being the Deep State's fool and thus his starting the Cold War on 26 July 1945, Hitler's vastly harmful impact was from his own, very private and longstanding, personal and always secret obsession against \\\"blood-poisoning\\\" of pureblooded Christians or \\\"Aryans,\\\" by Jews, which had started obsessing him in him in 1919, twenty years before the war to impose this exterminationist goal upon the the entire world became publicly unveiled \\u2014 a war that he partly lost when WW II ended, whereas Truman's war already partly won in 1991, and continues on even now, with the U.S. regime still planning to go in for the final kill, if and when it ever can.)WHITEOUT also noted (p. 138) that,Furthermore,And (p. 225),So: that was the CIA's first coup, and it happened in 1948, to Thailand:Such Special Operations are crucial to the illegal, treasonous (anti-Constitutional), control over the U.S. Government, by the Deep State (the aristocrats \\u2014 America's hundreds of billionaires who finance the bulk of successful political campaigns for federal office; these are the individuals who determine who will and who won't be able to become a serious contender for Congress, the Presidency, and judgeships). Not all of the money to fund Special Operations comes from the billionaires. An unknown percentage of it comes also from organized criminals \\u2014 violators of laws, instead of writers of laws. America's billionaires (via their paid agents, including gangsters) are the ones who write the laws. Organized criminals aren't that powerful, because they can only violate the laws. And when a gangster serves a billionaire, only the billionaire is standing above the law. \\\"Putin's Grand Gas Project Makes Sense Now\\\" , by \\\"Opinion\\\" writer Leonid Bershidsky.Here, now, in, are the especially relevant excerpts from it which indicate Bloomberg's publication of propaganda that's against Russia, and for isolating Russia by overthrowing governments which (like Saddam Hussein's, Muammar Gaddafi's, Viktor Yanukovych's, Bashar Assad's, Nicol\\u00e1s Maduro's, and Evo Morales's) had (or have) friendly relations with Russia:This ignores that by no later than June of 2013, the U.S. regime was already at the early implementation stage of its planned take-over not only of all of Ukrainewhich since 1783 has been and still remains in Crimea (which from 1954 to 2014 was part of Ukraine). That was to become yet another U.S. naval base.So: that Bloomberg-published phrase \\\"the invader of Crimea\\\" belongs actually to Obama, instead of to Putin, who merely responded to that U.S. invasion of Ukraine in the way that was essential for the national security of Russia. In doing so, Russia's President Putin also was protecting the people who live in Crimea, which is why they passionately wanted this response from him.The Bloomberg-published phrase \\\"the armed conflict Russia has instigated in Ukraine's eastern regions\\\" refers actually to the Obama-installed new Ukrainian regime's ethnic cleansing in that region to eliminate as many of the residents there as possible, because 90+% of them had voted for the man whom Obama had just overthrown, Viktor Yanukovych; and, if those voters would still remain inside Ukraine, then Obama's new Ukrainian regime would easily be voted out of power and would thus quickly end. Obama's regime didn't want too many of those voters still to be living there if and when that area, called \\\"Donbass,\\\" would finally become restored to Ukraine and they would become Ukrainian voters again, because that would surely then lead to an end of America's control over Ukraine. The civilian population in Donbass were specifically targeted. Here's a map of the election in which Yanukovych became Ukraine's President, and as you can see there, the far-eastern dark purple area, where Yanukovych received at least 90% of the vote, is the \\\"eastern regions\\\" that refused to be ruled by the Obama-installed Ukrainian regime.The purpose of the newly installed Ukrainian Government's ethnic cleansing in that area wasn't only to kill as many people there as they could, but especially to force millions of them to flee across the border into Russia, so that, if and when that region would ever become restored again to Ukrainian control, as many voters as possible who had lived there would either have been killed or else become Russians and resettled in Russia.On 27 February 2006, David McClintick headlined a now-classic 20,000-word article in Institutional Investor magazine, \\\"How Harvard lost Russia\\\" , and he detailed there the rape of Russia in the early 1990s, by Lawrence Summers and his Harvard team of corrupt and deceiving economists, whom first Mikhail Gorbachev, and then Boris Yeltsin, naively brought in to guide Russia through the process of transforming from a communist to a capitalist economy. (Those two Russian leaders didn't understand fascism, and especially not its imperialistic type, such as Harvard and most of its ilk represent.) Basically, Summers, whose entire career has been spent assisting and helping America's billionaires, selected a team of advisors for this who when they weren't themselves outright corrupt, were nonetheless incredibly destructive in privatizing Russia's state-owned assets to Russia's most corrupt and well-connected insiders, who became billionaires in the process and secreted their newly gained wealth in London and elsewhere, so that the Russian Government's system of social-welfare benefits and of infrastructure were yanked out from under Russia's public.If you want to see in charts and graphs what the impact upon Russia has been from Putin's treating as criminals the most-corrupt of those Russian billionaires and his trying to get them to pay the taxes that they had avoided and hid abroad, click here . As is shown there,between 1990-2000 when Putin became President, who turned this around so that Russia has thrived under his leadership. Bershidsky wants to restore the pre-Putin type of leadership \\u2014 near-starvation to the Russian masses.Whereas Bloomberg 'News' pumps the lie about Putin's \\\"victims such as Ukraine,\\\" the clear and incontestable reality is that Barack Obama destroyed Ukraine in 2014, and that \\\"The Obama Regime's Plan to Seize the Russian Naval Base in Crimea\\\" started being implemented by the Obama Administration by no later than June 2013 \\u2014 well before his coup.The U.S. was backing an outright racist-fascist, or nazi, operation in Ukraine, as is clearly shown here and here . No one can reasonably assert that today's America isn't at least fascist, if not outright nazi (though predominantly anti-Russian instead of anti-Semitic, but any form of racist fascism is nazi ideology, and Obama's was a form of that: anti-Russian)., and those media \\u2014 as is exemplified well in this article from Bloomberg's Leonid Bershidsky \\u2014 base their international-'news' reporting, and analysis, on what is of benefit to America's billionaires, instead of to their victims, either at home or abroad. What type of fascists would produce such fascist propaganda? How is it not extreme? It's an extremist form of capitalism, of the most dangerous type: both racist and imperialist.Even most of the allegedly 'anti-war' or 'progressive' 'news'-media in America are actually pro-imperialistic , and the contrary front by them is itself part of their propaganda. Their function is to publish criticism of billionaires and of the Government, but nothing that would encourage any sort of revolution to eliminate the dictators (including their agents) and to replace them by a different system. In the United States, where the existing Constitution is democratic and the Government simply violates it routinely and the corrupt judges after 1970 have employed lies to label these clear violations 'constitutional', a revolution would need to eliminate the dictators but not the Constitution. In some other dictatorships, it would need to replace both, and replacing the system would thus have to be more drastic than merely replacing the existing rulers. Fortunately, that's not necessary in the United States; so, a bloodless revolution could restore America to democracy, though all post-1970 Constitutional rulings would need to be then reviewed by completely changed personnel in the U.S. Supreme Court, for possible reversal. In a bloodless revolution, changing all members would take decades; so, that process would have to start only after all other stages of such a revolution are already completed. It's possible, but unlikely. America will therefore probably remain a dictatorship by its richest. Though America's Founders sought not only to eliminate the British aristocracy here, but any subsequent aristocracy from ruling (even an American one) in the United States, America's richest did rise, after WW-II, to become America's aristocracy (now called America's \\\"Deep State\\\" ), and the U.S. Constitution will probably remain, and increasingly become, a dead letter here \\u2014 increasingly lied-about by America's top Court as it establishes more and more fraudulent precedents, which insult the consensus-intentions of the great men who wrote and signed the Constitution and each one of its Amendments.Even the Monroe Doctrine in 1823 (which is so often cited by American imperialists to 'justify' rapes and attempted rapes by the U.S. regime against countries in the Western Hemisphere such as Bolivia and Venezuela) was anti-imperialistic, and simply said that the United States opposed European countries' efforts to take over countries in the Western Hemisphere.\\u2014 yet another historical lie by the aristocracy. American fascism (especially of the imperialistic sort, which is commonly called now \\\"neoconservatism\\\") isrooted in the U.S. Constitution; itthe U.S. Constitution. Our current Government does not represent the United States of America (the U.S. Constitution \\u2014 \\\"We, the People ...\\\" \\u2014 and that's all Americans). But it does represent hundreds of today's Americans, the Deep State, which need to be eliminated and replaced so that this country becomes, again, a democracy.Other key sources, than the Cockburn-St.-Clair WHITEOUT , in order to understand today's U.S. Government, are:All of these describe the operation that agents of America's aristocrats carried out after FDR's 1945 death, in order, ultimately \\u2014 with the consciously planned ultimate aim being \\u2014 to surround Russia by enemies (transforming even its former allies into its enemies), and then to take control over both Russia and China, and thus to become dictators to the entire planet, nullifying U.S. President FDR's intention, which had been instead for an international democratic federal republic of nations emerging from the U.N. \\u2014 for the termination, instead of for the culmination, of all imperialisms.\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.sott.net/article/427994-Michael-Bloombergs-crew-of-journalists-propagandize-for-more-US-aggression\", \"published\": \"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 21:44:11 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580006651, \"collection_utc\": 1579999133}",News,1580006651

That's propaganda favoring U.S. imperialism, which actually violates the intentions of America's Founders, and the spirit of the U.S. Constitution.The U.S. regime's propaganda doesn't come from the Government directly, but instead from the 607 billionaires who control the regime,financing their careers, and by their owning (and otherwise controlling) the regime's 'news'-media, which are privately owned and which carry the same propaganda as the Government's 'publicly owned' 'news'-media do \\u2014 all of America's mainstream 'news'-media being in favor of the U.S. Government's sanctioning (economic-blockading) and trying to overthrow by means of coup or sometimes outright invasion, countries (such as Iraq, Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Libya, etc.) that had never invaded, nor even threatened to invade, the United States. U.S. imperialism is commonly called \\\"neoconservatism,\\\" but it is basically the same as other imperialistic regimes throughout history \\u2014By means of these lies, the nation's public are made willing to fund these invasions in their taxes and can even think that it is their patriotic duty, instead of being a massively criminal enterprise that they've been fooled into supporting with their dollars and sometimes with their very bodies.First here will be essential historical background, in order for a reader to be able to understand typical U.S.-and-allied propaganda; and, then, will come a typical example which displays the results of that history and which thereby exposes the crucially implicit lies in that propaganda, and which cause it to be effective propaganda \\u2014 the sort of deceits that fool most of the public into favoring these invasions and other international aggressions, which aggressions routinely produce mass-murders, benefiting only the aggressor-nation's aristocracy and the aristocracies that are allied with them. This is the way that wealth in the U.S. has come to be so extremely narrowly held, so that, for example, a January 2018 study done for Deutsche Bank, \\\"US Income and Wealth Inequality\\\", reported (p. 9) that \\\"US: Top 0.1% owns as many assets as the bottom 90%\\\", and (p. 11) that, out of all the 34 OECD nations, America has the most unequal incomes \\u2014 the most extreme inequality, of them all. The billionaires and their agents say that this is okay because, as the wealthy economist Lawrence Summers once put it , \\\"we should accept inequality of results, recognizing that those who earn more are in a better position to contribute more to support society.\\\" (Rich people tend to believe that, and to reward economists such as Summer for teaching that. It's essential to their propaganda \\u2014 and they fool especially themselves into believing it.)The example to be dissected here will be from Wall Street's Michael Bloomberg. Though he doesn't deceive the public more than other billionaires do, he is running to become America's President in order to replace another deceptive billionaire, Donald Trump, and so his 'news'-operation provides a typical example of the mendacity of America's mainstream (that's to say, its billionaire-controlled) 'journalism' (virtually everything concerning international relations in U.S.-and-allied 'journalism' is propaganda: written so as to deceive).Washington DC and NYC both get their 'news' from such highly compromised, billionaires-owned-and-controlled, 'news'-media, as these. America's broadcast media then spread that 'news', nationally, and internationally.The individuals who report 'news' at a 'news'-medium such as Bloomberg 'News', do what the operation's owners and its advertisers want them to do, which is to propagandize for their aristocracy \\u2014 their own and allied billionaires' corporations' expansion so as to extend their empire into more countries and push aside the local aristocracy there, and, in this way, to concentrate the world's wealth into their own and allied corporations. An expansionist or \\\"imperialistic\\\" aristocracy's goals are analogous to gangland operations, except that. It creates laws within its own nation, and it creates laws also internationally via alliances and treaties, and it uses alliances and treaties against 'enemies', such as the military alliance and treaty organization NATO, in order to pump increased sales of their own nation's corporations' weaponry (such as from Raytheon Corporation), and it also uses those international laws via sanctions and secondary sanctions, which can become the preliminary phase of an outright military invasion of the targeted country after finally declaring the nation to be an 'enemy' and thus 'acceptable' to invade and take over, for 'us' against 'them'. (For example: Trump is outright refusing the demand by Iraq's sovereign Government for all U.S. forces to leave.) Mere gangsters cannot do any such things, and so they are much more under the gun than \\\"banksters\\\" (aristocrats and their agents) are.This is the difference between imperialistic operations versus organized-crime operations. Organized crime is lower-class because it doesn't control the government, but, when the anti-organized-crime Kennedy brothers were briefly in power in the U.S., organized crime did at least provide crucial assistance to eliminating the Kennedys; and, in that sense, organized crime was itself part of America's Establishment, at least at that time. Furthermore, as Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair documented in their classic 1998 WHITEOUT: The CIA, Drugs and the Press (p. 134),Organized crime is often essential to the CIA's \\\"Special Operations.\\\" Organizations such as the Mafia are valuable assets of the CIA. They are experts at getting things done secretly. And such operations are less likely than any other to ever be exposed as having been CIA operations. Organized crime is thus a terrific asset to international intelligence agencies \\u2014 especially to America's CIA, which promotes itself as representing a 'democracy', even though it represents, instead, a fascist-imperialist regime.Two years before the CIA got into protecting the heroin trade, U.S. President Harry S. Truman was, on 26 July 1945 , persuaded by his top general, Dwight David Eisenhower (hypocritical inventor of the PR phrase he used against the Establishment \\u2014 which he actually always supported \\u2014 \\\"military-industrial complex\\\") that if the United States wouldn't conquer the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union would conquer the United States, and so the suckered-by-Eisenhower Truman launched the Cold War on that date; and, on that basis, he turned America's most essential WW II ally, the Soviet Union, into an enemy, and the Cold War secretly remains U.S. policy till this very day. (This was exactly the opposite of what Truman's immediate predecessor, FDR, had intended.) The strategy, after U.S. President George Herbert Walker Bush (on 24 February 1990 ) secretly ordered America's leading vassals to continue the Cold War on the U.S.-and-allied side after the Soviet Union and its communism and their Warsaw-Pact mirror to America's NATO would all end the following year, has been to surround Russia with enemies (Russia-allied countries that would be flipped to become U.S.-allied countries, by means of CIA subversion coups , etc.), with the aim being ultimately to go in and conquer Russia . This plan requires a massive amount of propaganda , but it has been very successful, in ousting Russia-friendly governments such as in Yugoslavia in 1991-99, Iraq 2003, Libya 2011, and Ukraine 2014 , though not yet achieving its final destination, winning World War III (WW-III) by grabbing control over Russia itself The first CIA coup (these coups were done by their \\\"Special Operations\\\" division) was in Thailand in the second year of the CIA's existence, 1948, and it was done in order to take over the opium-heroin trade in southeast Asia (including Burma \\u2014 now Myanmar) and to use it for providing essential off-the-books finance to the CIA in order for the CIA to do its part of the job of conquering Russia, \\\"Special Operations.\\\" As WHITEOUT (p. 136) put it:That was how the \\\"The Buck Stops Here\\\" President, Truman, actually functioned. (Similarly, Hitler's \\\"signature was on no compromising document\\\" about the Holocaust, but, as I documented in my own 2000 WHY the Holocaust Happened, Hitler was the individual who ordered it \\u2014 that was an executive action from the very top. It wasn't any truer that Truman was a 'weak dictator' than that Hitler, whom some Hitler-supporters label with that phrase, was. However, there were important differences between them: Truman's impact turned out to shape subsequent history even more than Hitler's impact did. And, whereas Truman's vastly harmful impact resulted from his being the Deep State's fool and thus his starting the Cold War on 26 July 1945, Hitler's vastly harmful impact was from his own, very private and longstanding, personal and always secret obsession against \\\"blood-poisoning\\\" of pureblooded Christians or \\\"Aryans,\\\" by Jews, which had started obsessing him in him in 1919, twenty years before the war to impose this exterminationist goal upon the the entire world became publicly unveiled \\u2014 a war that he partly lost when WW II ended, whereas Truman's war already partly won in 1991, and continues on even now, with the U.S. regime still planning to go in for the final kill, if and when it ever can.)WHITEOUT also noted (p. 138) that,Furthermore,And (p. 225),So: that was the CIA's first coup, and it happened in 1948, to Thailand:Such Special Operations are crucial to the illegal, treasonous (anti-Constitutional), control over the U.S. Government, by the Deep State (the aristocrats \\u2014 America's hundreds of billionaires who finance the bulk of successful political campaigns for federal office; these are the individuals who determine who will and who won't be able to become a serious contender for Congress, the Presidency, and judgeships). Not all of the money to fund Special Operations comes from the billionaires. An unknown percentage of it comes also from organized criminals \\u2014 violators of laws, instead of writers of laws. America's billionaires (via their paid agents, including gangsters) are the ones who write the laws. Organized criminals aren't that powerful, because they can only violate the laws. And when a gangster serves a billionaire, only the billionaire is standing above the law. \\\"Putin's Grand Gas Project Makes Sense Now\\\" , by \\\"Opinion\\\" writer Leonid Bershidsky.Here, now, in, are the especially relevant excerpts from it which indicate Bloomberg's publication of propaganda that's against Russia, and for isolating Russia by overthrowing governments which (like Saddam Hussein's, Muammar Gaddafi's, Viktor Yanukovych's, Bashar Assad's, Nicol\\u00e1s Maduro's, and Evo Morales's) had (or have) friendly relations with Russia:This ignores that by no later than June of 2013, the U.S. regime was already at the early implementation stage of its planned take-over not only of all of Ukrainewhich since 1783 has been and still remains in Crimea (which from 1954 to 2014 was part of Ukraine). That was to become yet another U.S. naval base.So: that Bloomberg-published phrase \\\"the invader of Crimea\\\" belongs actually to Obama, instead of to Putin, who merely responded to that U.S. invasion of Ukraine in the way that was essential for the national security of Russia. In doing so, Russia's President Putin also was protecting the people who live in Crimea, which is why they passionately wanted this response from him.The Bloomberg-published phrase \\\"the armed conflict Russia has instigated in Ukraine's eastern regions\\\" refers actually to the Obama-installed new Ukrainian regime's ethnic cleansing in that region to eliminate as many of the residents there as possible, because 90+% of them had voted for the man whom Obama had just overthrown, Viktor Yanukovych; and, if those voters would still remain inside Ukraine, then Obama's new Ukrainian regime would easily be voted out of power and would thus quickly end. Obama's regime didn't want too many of those voters still to be living there if and when that area, called \\\"Donbass,\\\" would finally become restored to Ukraine and they would become Ukrainian voters again, because that would surely then lead to an end of America's control over Ukraine. The civilian population in Donbass were specifically targeted. Here's a map of the election in which Yanukovych became Ukraine's President, and as you can see there, the far-eastern dark purple area, where Yanukovych received at least 90% of the vote, is the \\\"eastern regions\\\" that refused to be ruled by the Obama-installed Ukrainian regime.The purpose of the newly installed Ukrainian Government's ethnic cleansing in that area wasn't only to kill as many people there as they could, but especially to force millions of them to flee across the border into Russia, so that, if and when that region would ever become restored again to Ukrainian control, as many voters as possible who had lived there would either have been killed or else become Russians and resettled in Russia.On 27 February 2006, David McClintick headlined a now-classic 20,000-word article in Institutional Investor magazine, \\\"How Harvard lost Russia\\\" , and he detailed there the rape of Russia in the early 1990s, by Lawrence Summers and his Harvard team of corrupt and deceiving economists, whom first Mikhail Gorbachev, and then Boris Yeltsin, naively brought in to guide Russia through the process of transforming from a communist to a capitalist economy. (Those two Russian leaders didn't understand fascism, and especially not its imperialistic type, such as Harvard and most of its ilk represent.) Basically, Summers, whose entire career has been spent assisting and helping America's billionaires, selected a team of advisors for this who when they weren't themselves outright corrupt, were nonetheless incredibly destructive in privatizing Russia's state-owned assets to Russia's most corrupt and well-connected insiders, who became billionaires in the process and secreted their newly gained wealth in London and elsewhere, so that the Russian Government's system of social-welfare benefits and of infrastructure were yanked out from under Russia's public.If you want to see in charts and graphs what the impact upon Russia has been from Putin's treating as criminals the most-corrupt of those Russian billionaires and his trying to get them to pay the taxes that they had avoided and hid abroad, click here . As is shown there,between 1990-2000 when Putin became President, who turned this around so that Russia has thrived under his leadership. Bershidsky wants to restore the pre-Putin type of leadership \\u2014 near-starvation to the Russian masses.Whereas Bloomberg 'News' pumps the lie about Putin's \\\"victims such as Ukraine,\\\" the clear and incontestable reality is that Barack Obama destroyed Ukraine in 2014, and that \\\"The Obama Regime's Plan to Seize the Russian Naval Base in Crimea\\\" started being implemented by the Obama Administration by no later than June 2013 \\u2014 well before his coup.The U.S. was backing an outright racist-fascist, or nazi, operation in Ukraine, as is clearly shown here and here . No one can reasonably assert that today's America isn't at least fascist, if not outright nazi (though predominantly anti-Russian instead of anti-Semitic, but any form of racist fascism is nazi ideology, and Obama's was a form of that: anti-Russian)., and those media \\u2014 as is exemplified well in this article from Bloomberg's Leonid Bershidsky \\u2014 base their international-'news' reporting, and analysis, on what is of benefit to America's billionaires, instead of to their victims, either at home or abroad. What type of fascists would produce such fascist propaganda? How is it not extreme? It's an extremist form of capitalism, of the most dangerous type: both racist and imperialist.Even most of the allegedly 'anti-war' or 'progressive' 'news'-media in America are actually pro-imperialistic , and the contrary front by them is itself part of their propaganda. Their function is to publish criticism of billionaires and of the Government, but nothing that would encourage any sort of revolution to eliminate the dictators (including their agents) and to replace them by a different system. In the United States, where the existing Constitution is democratic and the Government simply violates it routinely and the corrupt judges after 1970 have employed lies to label these clear violations 'constitutional', a revolution would need to eliminate the dictators but not the Constitution. In some other dictatorships, it would need to replace both, and replacing the system would thus have to be more drastic than merely replacing the existing rulers. Fortunately, that's not necessary in the United States; so, a bloodless revolution could restore America to democracy, though all post-1970 Constitutional rulings would need to be then reviewed by completely changed personnel in the U.S. Supreme Court, for possible reversal. In a bloodless revolution, changing all members would take decades; so, that process would have to start only after all other stages of such a revolution are already completed. It's possible, but unlikely. America will therefore probably remain a dictatorship by its richest. Though America's Founders sought not only to eliminate the British aristocracy here, but any subsequent aristocracy from ruling (even an American one) in the United States, America's richest did rise, after WW-II, to become America's aristocracy (now called America's \\\"Deep State\\\" ), and the U.S. Constitution will probably remain, and increasingly become, a dead letter here \\u2014 increasingly lied-about by America's top Court as it establishes more and more fraudulent precedents, which insult the consensus-intentions of the great men who wrote and signed the Constitution and each one of its Amendments.Even the Monroe Doctrine in 1823 (which is so often cited by American imperialists to 'justify' rapes and attempted rapes by the U.S. regime against countries in the Western Hemisphere such as Bolivia and Venezuela) was anti-imperialistic, and simply said that the United States opposed European countries' efforts to take over countries in the Western Hemisphere.\\u2014 yet another historical lie by the aristocracy. American fascism (especially of the imperialistic sort, which is commonly called now \\\"neoconservatism\\\") isrooted in the U.S. Constitution; itthe U.S. Constitution. Our current Government does not represent the United States of America (the U.S. Constitution \\u2014 \\\"We, the People ...\\\" \\u2014 and that's all Americans). But it does represent hundreds of today's Americans, the Deep State, which need to be eliminated and replaced so that this country becomes, again, a democracy.Other key sources, than the Cockburn-St.-Clair WHITEOUT , in order to understand today's U.S. Government, are:All of these describe the operation that agents of America's aristocrats carried out after FDR's 1945 death, in order, ultimately \\u2014 with the consciously planned ultimate aim being \\u2014 to surround Russia by enemies (transforming even its former allies into its enemies), and then to take control over both Russia and China, and thus to become dictators to the entire planet, nullifying U.S. President FDR's intention, which had been instead for an international democratic federal republic of nations emerging from the U.N. \\u2014 for the termination, instead of for the culmination, of all imperialisms.\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.sott.net/article/427994-Michael-Bloombergs-crew-of-journalists-propagandize-for-more-US-aggression\", \"published\": \"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 21:44:11 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580006651, \"collection_utc\": 1579999133}",News,1580006651

CrisisFACTS-010-News-128-0,CrisisFACTS-010,"how to tell whats really happening with the wuhan virus how to tell whats really happening with the wuhan virus

its lunar new year usually a time of celebration in china but instead of heading into the streets to let off fireworks people are staying at home out of fear of contracting a fastspreading coronavirus","{\"id\": \"foreignpolicy--2020-01-25--How To Tell What\\u2019s Really Happening With the Wuhan Virus\", \"date\": \"2020-01-25\", \"source\": \"foreignpolicy\", \"title\": \"How To Tell What\\u2019s Really Happening With the Wuhan Virus\", \"content\": \"How To Tell What\\u2019s Really Happening With the Wuhan Virus\\n\\nIt\\u2019s Lunar New Year, usually a time of celebration in China, but instead of heading into the streets to let off fireworks, people are staying at home out of fear of contracting a fast-spreading coronavirus. The quarantine in China has now extended to nearly 50 million people, as sweeping restrictions on travel are expanding daily out from the epicenter of the outbreak in the city of Wuhan. These include bans on tour groups across the country, on long-distance travel in some cities, and on private transport in the center of Wuhan itself. The number of officially confirmed cases has reached 1,756, and continues to rise fast, with at least 54 dead, mostly elderly. China is struggling to cope with its worst health crisis since SARS in 2003, amid fears that Lunar New Year travel has already spread the infection far and wide. Every province and region in China, barring Tibet and Qinghai, both of which are geographically and politically isolated, has had cases of the virus. The United States has sent charter planes to evacuate its approximately 1,000 citizens and consular staff from the quarantine zone.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s too soon to tell, but quite probably not. The confirmed numbers may be just a fraction of the real total of infected victims, with many not yet diagnosed or even showing symptoms. But the biggest problem is that the long incubation period means hundreds of thousands of people left Wuhan long before the virus was seen as a major problem \\u2014especially as the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of people return to their families across China, was coming up. A lot now depends on where they ended up. The constant expansion of the quarantine zone, which now covers a huge chunk of the central Chinese province of Hubei, suggests that local transmission may have been fierce and fast, outrunning the authorities. Modeling by foreign scientists is producing disturbing results\\u2014250,000 or more infected inside Wuhan and large outbreaks elsewhere, with 60 percent or more of possible transmissions needing to be blocked to contain the outbreak.\\n\\nThe quarantine creates its own problems. Feeding and supplying the population inside, with regular logistical links severed, is a huge, though not impossible, task. China has exceptional logistics companies such as Alibaba, and they may be brought in, along with the military, to make sure shops stay supplied and people fed; long lines of trucks are heading into Wuhan to supply the population. That\\u2019s good, since Price gouging and shortages have already started.\\n\\nSo are we all going to die?\\n\\nProbably not. The coronavirus is highly worrying, but so far it lacks the pandemic properties of influenza and has a relatively low\\u2014experts believe\\u2014 mortality rate. The deaths so far have been mostly, but not exclusively, confined to older people, most of whom had preexisting conditions. The World Health Organization has declined to declare a global emergency, pointing to the relatively small number of cases outside China, although that could well change.\\n\\nThat said, many people remain in serious condition, and the virus has already mutated to pass from human to human\\u2014and could evolve further. At least one super-spreader\\u2014someone who passes the virus to an unusually high number of other victims\\u2014has already emerged in a Wuhan hospital.\\n\\nAnd while cases of infection appear to have been largely caught in foreign countries, thanks mostly to the victims being relatively well-off people who had access to health care resources, they\\u2019ve been popping up all over the place from Washington state to Malaysia. Given what seems to be a relatively long incubation period of seven to 12 days, during which victims can spread the virus without showing symptoms, it\\u2019s hard to tell just how far the virus has already reached.\\n\\nOn top of that, the range of symptoms is long, and some victims haven\\u2019t shown the most characteristic signs\\u2014and the ones being tested for\\u2014such as fever. The world could well see multiple outbreaks, especially if it reaches poorer and more vulnerable countries. Reports so far have been confined to developed nations like South Korea, France, and the United States, but it\\u2019s entirely possible that cases elsewhere have simply gone undetected.\\n\\nCan we trust the government figures right now?\\n\\nNo, for a variety of reasons. The first is that China has a record of concealing the numbers around disaster events for political reasons, from the initial cover-up around SARS to the regular underreporting of the number of dead from floods, landslides, industrial explosions, and other relatively routine disasters. In Wuhan\\u2019s case, it seems very likely that the leap to human-to-human transmission, and the sudden explosion in numbers, was concealed by local authorities keen not to risk the local economy or to disturb the smooth progress of the \\u201ctwo sessions,\\u201d important mid-January political meetings. The number of cases stayed at 41 for weeks and then suddenly jumped to more than 200 after the virus reached other countries a week ago. Meanwhile, Wuhan officials were scheduling large-scale public events right up until the quarantine was imposed.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s less reason for the central government to squash the numbers, and the enormous leap from 41 to more than 1300 cases this week may be the result of the sudden interest by Beijing in the epidemic. But government officials are also in the routine\\u2014and hard-to-break\\u2014habit of concealing information from the public, especially negative information. Huge amounts of resources are put into controlling and suppressing information in China, and doctors, reporters, and ordinary people have already been threatened or arrested for posting independently about the outbreak. A sudden flood of online posts today praised the government and criticized people for posting unauthorized information.\\n\\nChinese media is enjoying a short burst of relative freedom, with Caixin and other outlets producing some excellent and critical reporting. But that\\u2019s common in the aftermath of disaster in China; the sudden impetus of the news creates several days of comparative openness before the propaganda authorities decide and enforce new lines. (I saw it happen after the Sichuan earthquake and again after the Tianjin explosions when I worked in Chinese newsrooms.). Papers are already being forced to issue apologies if their reporters speak out of line. The internet might well be cut at some point, as happened in Xinjiang in 2009 after the riots there.\\n\\nEven if the government doesn\\u2019t want to distort data, its ability to gather information is also limited. Diagnostic test kits are in short supply, the population potentially affected is huge, and many poorer Chinese\\u2014those most affected\\u2014are out of reach for the state.\\n\\nThe scientific community in China is genuinely extremely concerned and attempting to share information as rapidly and transparently as it can with foreign counterparts. But it is also working within an environment where everything, even scientific research, is politicized. Since the ascent of Chinese President Xi Jinping to dictatorial status, many scientific papers begin with routine encomiums to Xi Jinping Thought, for instance.\\n\\nI keep seeing all these videos of dead bodies and people flooding Wuhan hospitals. What\\u2019s up with that?\\n\\nSeveral videos have emerged from Wuhan showing disturbing scenes at hospitals, such as bodies abandoned in corridors. But this doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re victims of the virus\\u2014except indirectly. Wuhan has 11 million people: Using the average mortality rate for China, that means approximately 213 people die there daily, as in any large city. Add in that it\\u2019s winter, and it\\u2019s flu season, and the conventional rate of death is even higher. Some of the videos are also mislabeled, or fakes; there\\u2019s a useful list being maintained here.\\n\\nNow remember that Wuhan\\u2019s health care system is completely flooded right now. Everyone with a cold is heading to the hospital to get checked, and medical staff are exhausted and overwhelmed. 150 army medical staff have been sent to help, and two emergency field hospital using prefabricated materials are being erected, but that\\u2019s unlikely to be enough. Those corpses are very likely people who died of regular causes but who simply haven\\u2019t been processed as they would in calmer times. As anyone who has been through Chinese health care knows, hospitals there are often chaotic places where patients regularly find themselves sitting with IVs in corridors, on the floor, or even in the parking lot; add in epidemic and quarantine, and everything falls apart. The regular medical number\\u2014120\\u2014is producing no response most of the time.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s one scary possibility here, though. Hospitals themselves could be becoming vectors for the virus. They\\u2019re already known to have infected at least 14 health care workers, and there are reports of widespread infection among medical staff who are running out of masks and gloves. Add to that patients crowding to get help, and even those whose symptoms are the result of ordinary colds rather than the virus might end up walking away infected.\\n\\nInside the quarantine zone, perhaps. A tremendous amount of fear is emerging in the patchy picture we get through social media. But there are no accounts of riots or disturbances or of clashes with police or attempts to escape the quarantine zone. That\\u2019s hopefully a good sign.\\n\\nOutside of Wuhan, people seem worried but calm. This is where some of China\\u2019s advantages, such as extensive networks of block workers and community centers, can come into play in keeping people informed without panic. There are runs on masks and hand sanitizer, which you\\u2019d expect. The most disturbing aspect may be the measures taken by some villages and townships, which are posting their own blockades to keep travelers out. That could get quite nasty, as anyone who has passed through a village gate late at night\\u2014where locals sometimes set up informal tollbooths, enforced by thugs\\u2014knows.\\n\\nThe control on information is probably helping to reduce potential panic and unjustified rumor, even as it may also be concealing vital facts. Chinese-language chat groups and forums in the United States, which lack those controls, seem far more panicked than those inside China itself, with extreme concern being shown over, for instance, visiting school groups from Wuhan and people warning others to stockpile medical supplies from CVS.\\n\\nThere are also widespread rumors among the Uighur diaspora\\u2014the Turkic minority persecuted by China in the Western region of Xinjiang; they\\u2019re expressing both fears that the original virus might have been a byproduct of Chinese bio-experimentation on Uighurs and more grounded worries that if the virus reaches the detention camps in which over a million Uighurs are held, the results could be a devastating infection.\\n\\nWhat about the political fallout?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s still very early days, but heads will almost certainly roll over the initial delay or cover-up. The central government has already made ominous noises. Given the usual pattern, this may well involve suddenly discovering that the Wuhan mayor, or local party leaders, was corrupt all along.\\n\\nIf the outbreak can be controlled, then this may be spun as a success for the system and a justification of authoritarian powers. If it isn\\u2019t, it\\u2019s a genuinely serious threat\\u2014not to Communist Party rule itself but to Xi. He\\u2019s already facing private dissent from members of the political-economic elite who believe he has mishandled national affairs. The disruption of a full-scale epidemic would be a perfect opportunity for his opponents to reveal themselves and move against him.\\n\\nThe top levels of the propaganda media\\u2014People\\u2019s Daily and the Xinwen Lianbo news broadcast\\u2014were still heavily downplaying the story until late in the week. People\\u2019s Daily hasn\\u2019t yet mentioned it on the front pages, which have been devoted entirely to praise of Xi and national prosperity; the story was buried on Page 4 on Wednesday, while it took the nightly news 22 minutes to reach the story. On Saturday, however, the broadcast led with a seven-minute meeting of the Central Committee, showing Xi in a leadership role.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s a contrast with previous disasters under Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, where the media led with images of national leadership and personal appearances. Wen, in particular, became sardonically nicknamed \\u201cthe best actor\\u201d for his kind but stern appearances in disaster zones, ordering local officials around and representing the paternal control of the party. Neither Xi nor premier Li Keqiang has visited Wuhan or announced plans to do so.\\n\\nThat might be simply because it\\u2019s far more difficult to protect a leader from a virus than from fire or flood. But it might also be a real fear that the epidemic will run out of control\\u2014and thus a desire to disassociate themselves from it as much as possible.\", \"author\": \"James Palmer\", \"url\": \"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/25/how-to-tell-whats-really-happening-with-the-wuhan-virus/\", \"published\": \"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 23:48:31 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580014111, \"collection_utc\": 1579999063}",News,1580014111
CrisisFACTS-010-News-128-1,CrisisFACTS-010,the quarantine in china has now extended to nearly 50 million people as sweeping restrictions on travel are expanding daily out from the epicenter of the outbreak in the city of wuhan,"{\"id\": \"foreignpolicy--2020-01-25--How To Tell What\\u2019s Really Happening With the Wuhan Virus\", \"date\": \"2020-01-25\", \"source\": \"foreignpolicy\", \"title\": \"How To Tell What\\u2019s Really Happening With the Wuhan Virus\", \"content\": \"How To Tell What\\u2019s Really Happening With the Wuhan Virus\\n\\nIt\\u2019s Lunar New Year, usually a time of celebration in China, but instead of heading into the streets to let off fireworks, people are staying at home out of fear of contracting a fast-spreading coronavirus. The quarantine in China has now extended to nearly 50 million people, as sweeping restrictions on travel are expanding daily out from the epicenter of the outbreak in the city of Wuhan. These include bans on tour groups across the country, on long-distance travel in some cities, and on private transport in the center of Wuhan itself. The number of officially confirmed cases has reached 1,756, and continues to rise fast, with at least 54 dead, mostly elderly. China is struggling to cope with its worst health crisis since SARS in 2003, amid fears that Lunar New Year travel has already spread the infection far and wide. Every province and region in China, barring Tibet and Qinghai, both of which are geographically and politically isolated, has had cases of the virus. The United States has sent charter planes to evacuate its approximately 1,000 citizens and consular staff from the quarantine zone.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s too soon to tell, but quite probably not. The confirmed numbers may be just a fraction of the real total of infected victims, with many not yet diagnosed or even showing symptoms. But the biggest problem is that the long incubation period means hundreds of thousands of people left Wuhan long before the virus was seen as a major problem \\u2014especially as the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of people return to their families across China, was coming up. A lot now depends on where they ended up. The constant expansion of the quarantine zone, which now covers a huge chunk of the central Chinese province of Hubei, suggests that local transmission may have been fierce and fast, outrunning the authorities. Modeling by foreign scientists is producing disturbing results\\u2014250,000 or more infected inside Wuhan and large outbreaks elsewhere, with 60 percent or more of possible transmissions needing to be blocked to contain the outbreak.\\n\\nThe quarantine creates its own problems. Feeding and supplying the population inside, with regular logistical links severed, is a huge, though not impossible, task. China has exceptional logistics companies such as Alibaba, and they may be brought in, along with the military, to make sure shops stay supplied and people fed; long lines of trucks are heading into Wuhan to supply the population. That\\u2019s good, since Price gouging and shortages have already started.\\n\\nSo are we all going to die?\\n\\nProbably not. The coronavirus is highly worrying, but so far it lacks the pandemic properties of influenza and has a relatively low\\u2014experts believe\\u2014 mortality rate. The deaths so far have been mostly, but not exclusively, confined to older people, most of whom had preexisting conditions. The World Health Organization has declined to declare a global emergency, pointing to the relatively small number of cases outside China, although that could well change.\\n\\nThat said, many people remain in serious condition, and the virus has already mutated to pass from human to human\\u2014and could evolve further. At least one super-spreader\\u2014someone who passes the virus to an unusually high number of other victims\\u2014has already emerged in a Wuhan hospital.\\n\\nAnd while cases of infection appear to have been largely caught in foreign countries, thanks mostly to the victims being relatively well-off people who had access to health care resources, they\\u2019ve been popping up all over the place from Washington state to Malaysia. Given what seems to be a relatively long incubation period of seven to 12 days, during which victims can spread the virus without showing symptoms, it\\u2019s hard to tell just how far the virus has already reached.\\n\\nOn top of that, the range of symptoms is long, and some victims haven\\u2019t shown the most characteristic signs\\u2014and the ones being tested for\\u2014such as fever. The world could well see multiple outbreaks, especially if it reaches poorer and more vulnerable countries. Reports so far have been confined to developed nations like South Korea, France, and the United States, but it\\u2019s entirely possible that cases elsewhere have simply gone undetected.\\n\\nCan we trust the government figures right now?\\n\\nNo, for a variety of reasons. The first is that China has a record of concealing the numbers around disaster events for political reasons, from the initial cover-up around SARS to the regular underreporting of the number of dead from floods, landslides, industrial explosions, and other relatively routine disasters.

The quarantine in China has now extended to nearly 50 million people, as sweeping restrictions on travel are expanding daily out from the epicenter of the outbreak in the city of Wuhan. These include bans on tour groups across the country, on long-distance travel in some cities, and on private transport in the center of Wuhan itself. The number of officially confirmed cases has reached 1,756, and continues to rise fast, with at least 54 dead, mostly elderly. China is struggling to cope with its worst health crisis since SARS in 2003, amid fears that Lunar New Year travel has already spread the infection far and wide. Every province and region in China, barring Tibet and Qinghai, both of which are geographically and politically isolated, has had cases of the virus. The United States has sent charter planes to evacuate its approximately 1,000 citizens and consular staff from the quarantine zone.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s too soon to tell, but quite probably not. The confirmed numbers may be just a fraction of the real total of infected victims, with many not yet diagnosed or even showing symptoms. But the biggest problem is that the long incubation period means hundreds of thousands of people left Wuhan long before the virus was seen as a major problem \\u2014especially as the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of people return to their families across China, was coming up. A lot now depends on where they ended up. The constant expansion of the quarantine zone, which now covers a huge chunk of the central Chinese province of Hubei, suggests that local transmission may have been fierce and fast, outrunning the authorities. Modeling by foreign scientists is producing disturbing results\\u2014250,000 or more infected inside Wuhan and large outbreaks elsewhere, with 60 percent or more of possible transmissions needing to be blocked to contain the outbreak.\\n\\nThe quarantine creates its own problems. Feeding and supplying the population inside, with regular logistical links severed, is a huge, though not impossible, task. China has exceptional logistics companies such as Alibaba, and they may be brought in, along with the military, to make sure shops stay supplied and people fed; long lines of trucks are heading into Wuhan to supply the population. That\\u2019s good, since Price gouging and shortages have already started.\\n\\nSo are we all going to die?\\n\\nProbably not. The coronavirus is highly worrying, but so far it lacks the pandemic properties of influenza and has a relatively low\\u2014experts believe\\u2014 mortality rate. The deaths so far have been mostly, but not exclusively, confined to older people, most of whom had preexisting conditions. The World Health Organization has declined to declare a global emergency, pointing to the relatively small number of cases outside China, although that could well change.\\n\\nThat said, many people remain in serious condition, and the virus has already mutated to pass from human to human\\u2014and could evolve further. At least one super-spreader\\u2014someone who passes the virus to an unusually high number of other victims\\u2014has already emerged in a Wuhan hospital.\\n\\nAnd while cases of infection appear to have been largely caught in foreign countries, thanks mostly to the victims being relatively well-off people who had access to health care resources, they\\u2019ve been popping up all over the place from Washington state to Malaysia. Given what seems to be a relatively long incubation period of seven to 12 days, during which victims can spread the virus without showing symptoms, it\\u2019s hard to tell just how far the virus has already reached.\\n\\nOn top of that, the range of symptoms is long, and some victims haven\\u2019t shown the most characteristic signs\\u2014and the ones being tested for\\u2014such as fever. The world could well see multiple outbreaks, especially if it reaches poorer and more vulnerable countries. Reports so far have been confined to developed nations like South Korea, France, and the United States, but it\\u2019s entirely possible that cases elsewhere have simply gone undetected.\\n\\nCan we trust the government figures right now?\\n\\nNo, for a variety of reasons. The first is that China has a record of concealing the numbers around disaster events for political reasons, from the initial cover-up around SARS to the regular underreporting of the number of dead from floods, landslides, industrial explosions, and other relatively routine disasters. In Wuhan\\u2019s case, it seems very likely that the leap to human-to-human transmission, and the sudden explosion in numbers, was concealed by local authorities keen not to risk the local economy or to disturb the smooth progress of the \\u201ctwo sessions,\\u201d important mid-January political meetings. The number of cases stayed at 41 for weeks and then suddenly jumped to more than 200 after the virus reached other countries a week ago. Meanwhile, Wuhan officials were scheduling large-scale public events right up until the quarantine was imposed.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s less reason for the central government to squash the numbers, and the enormous leap from 41 to more than 1300 cases this week may be the result of the sudden interest by Beijing in the epidemic. But government officials are also in the routine\\u2014and hard-to-break\\u2014habit of concealing information from the public, especially negative information. Huge amounts of resources are put into controlling and suppressing information in China, and doctors, reporters, and ordinary people have already been threatened or arrested for posting independently about the outbreak. A sudden flood of online posts today praised the government and criticized people for posting unauthorized information.\\n\\nChinese media is enjoying a short burst of relative freedom, with Caixin and other outlets producing some excellent and critical reporting. But that\\u2019s common in the aftermath of disaster in China; the sudden impetus of the news creates several days of comparative openness before the propaganda authorities decide and enforce new lines. (I saw it happen after the Sichuan earthquake and again after the Tianjin explosions when I worked in Chinese newsrooms.). Papers are already being forced to issue apologies if their reporters speak out of line. The internet might well be cut at some point, as happened in Xinjiang in 2009 after the riots there.\\n\\nEven if the government doesn\\u2019t want to distort data, its ability to gather information is also limited. Diagnostic test kits are in short supply, the population potentially affected is huge, and many poorer Chinese\\u2014those most affected\\u2014are out of reach for the state.\\n\\nThe scientific community in China is genuinely extremely concerned and attempting to share information as rapidly and transparently as it can with foreign counterparts. But it is also working within an environment where everything, even scientific research, is politicized. Since the ascent of Chinese President Xi Jinping to dictatorial status, many scientific papers begin with routine encomiums to Xi Jinping Thought, for instance.\\n\\nI keep seeing all these videos of dead bodies and people flooding Wuhan hospitals. What\\u2019s up with that?\\n\\nSeveral videos have emerged from Wuhan showing disturbing scenes at hospitals, such as bodies abandoned in corridors. But this doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re victims of the virus\\u2014except indirectly. Wuhan has 11 million people: Using the average mortality rate for China, that means approximately 213 people die there daily, as in any large city. Add in that it\\u2019s winter, and it\\u2019s flu season, and the conventional rate of death is even higher. Some of the videos are also mislabeled, or fakes; there\\u2019s a useful list being maintained here.\\n\\nNow remember that Wuhan\\u2019s health care system is completely flooded right now. Everyone with a cold is heading to the hospital to get checked, and medical staff are exhausted and overwhelmed. 150 army medical staff have been sent to help, and two emergency field hospital using prefabricated materials are being erected, but that\\u2019s unlikely to be enough. Those corpses are very likely people who died of regular causes but who simply haven\\u2019t been processed as they would in calmer times. As anyone who has been through Chinese health care knows, hospitals there are often chaotic places where patients regularly find themselves sitting with IVs in corridors, on the floor, or even in the parking lot; add in epidemic and quarantine, and everything falls apart. The regular medical number\\u2014120\\u2014is producing no response most of the time.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s one scary possibility here, though. Hospitals themselves could be becoming vectors for the virus. They\\u2019re already known to have infected at least 14 health care workers, and there are reports of widespread infection among medical staff who are running out of masks and gloves. Add to that patients crowding to get help, and even those whose symptoms are the result of ordinary colds rather than the virus might end up walking away infected.\\n\\nInside the quarantine zone, perhaps. A tremendous amount of fear is emerging in the patchy picture we get through social media. But there are no accounts of riots or disturbances or of clashes with police or attempts to escape the quarantine zone. That\\u2019s hopefully a good sign.\\n\\nOutside of Wuhan, people seem worried but calm. This is where some of China\\u2019s advantages, such as extensive networks of block workers and community centers, can come into play in keeping people informed without panic. There are runs on masks and hand sanitizer, which you\\u2019d expect. The most disturbing aspect may be the measures taken by some villages and townships, which are posting their own blockades to keep travelers out. That could get quite nasty, as anyone who has passed through a village gate late at night\\u2014where locals sometimes set up informal tollbooths, enforced by thugs\\u2014knows.\\n\\nThe control on information is probably helping to reduce potential panic and unjustified rumor, even as it may also be concealing vital facts.

Modeling by foreign scientists is producing disturbing results\\u2014250,000 or more infected inside Wuhan and large outbreaks elsewhere, with 60 percent or more of possible transmissions needing to be blocked to contain the outbreak.\\n\\nThe quarantine creates its own problems. Feeding and supplying the population inside, with regular logistical links severed, is a huge, though not impossible, task. China has exceptional logistics companies such as Alibaba, and they may be brought in, along with the military, to make sure shops stay supplied and people fed; long lines of trucks are heading into Wuhan to supply the population. That\\u2019s good, since Price gouging and shortages have already started.\\n\\nSo are we all going to die?\\n\\nProbably not. The coronavirus is highly worrying, but so far it lacks the pandemic properties of influenza and has a relatively low\\u2014experts believe\\u2014 mortality rate. The deaths so far have been mostly, but not exclusively, confined to older people, most of whom had preexisting conditions. The World Health Organization has declined to declare a global emergency, pointing to the relatively small number of cases outside China, although that could well change.\\n\\nThat said, many people remain in serious condition, and the virus has already mutated to pass from human to human\\u2014and could evolve further. At least one super-spreader\\u2014someone who passes the virus to an unusually high number of other victims\\u2014has already emerged in a Wuhan hospital.\\n\\nAnd while cases of infection appear to have been largely caught in foreign countries, thanks mostly to the victims being relatively well-off people who had access to health care resources, they\\u2019ve been popping up all over the place from Washington state to Malaysia. Given what seems to be a relatively long incubation period of seven to 12 days, during which victims can spread the virus without showing symptoms, it\\u2019s hard to tell just how far the virus has already reached.\\n\\nOn top of that, the range of symptoms is long, and some victims haven\\u2019t shown the most characteristic signs\\u2014and the ones being tested for\\u2014such as fever. The world could well see multiple outbreaks, especially if it reaches poorer and more vulnerable countries. Reports so far have been confined to developed nations like South Korea, France, and the United States, but it\\u2019s entirely possible that cases elsewhere have simply gone undetected.\\n\\nCan we trust the government figures right now?\\n\\nNo, for a variety of reasons. The first is that China has a record of concealing the numbers around disaster events for political reasons, from the initial cover-up around SARS to the regular underreporting of the number of dead from floods, landslides, industrial explosions, and other relatively routine disasters. In Wuhan\\u2019s case, it seems very likely that the leap to human-to-human transmission, and the sudden explosion in numbers, was concealed by local authorities keen not to risk the local economy or to disturb the smooth progress of the \\u201ctwo sessions,\\u201d important mid-January political meetings. The number of cases stayed at 41 for weeks and then suddenly jumped to more than 200 after the virus reached other countries a week ago. Meanwhile, Wuhan officials were scheduling large-scale public events right up until the quarantine was imposed.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s less reason for the central government to squash the numbers, and the enormous leap from 41 to more than 1300 cases this week may be the result of the sudden interest by Beijing in the epidemic. But government officials are also in the routine\\u2014and hard-to-break\\u2014habit of concealing information from the public, especially negative information. Huge amounts of resources are put into controlling and suppressing information in China, and doctors, reporters, and ordinary people have already been threatened or arrested for posting independently about the outbreak. A sudden flood of online posts today praised the government and criticized people for posting unauthorized information.\\n\\nChinese media is enjoying a short burst of relative freedom, with Caixin and other outlets producing some excellent and critical reporting. But that\\u2019s common in the aftermath of disaster in China; the sudden impetus of the news creates several days of comparative openness before the propaganda authorities decide and enforce new lines. (I saw it happen after the Sichuan earthquake and again after the Tianjin explosions when I worked in Chinese newsrooms.). Papers are already being forced to issue apologies if their reporters speak out of line. The internet might well be cut at some point, as happened in Xinjiang in 2009 after the riots there.\\n\\nEven if the government doesn\\u2019t want to distort data, its ability to gather information is also limited. Diagnostic test kits are in short supply, the population potentially affected is huge, and many poorer Chinese\\u2014those most affected\\u2014are out of reach for the state.\\n\\nThe scientific community in China is genuinely extremely concerned and attempting to share information as rapidly and transparently as it can with foreign counterparts. But it is also working within an environment where everything, even scientific research, is politicized. Since the ascent of Chinese President Xi Jinping to dictatorial status, many scientific papers begin with routine encomiums to Xi Jinping Thought, for instance.\\n\\nI keep seeing all these videos of dead bodies and people flooding Wuhan hospitals. What\\u2019s up with that?\\n\\nSeveral videos have emerged from Wuhan showing disturbing scenes at hospitals, such as bodies abandoned in corridors. But this doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re victims of the virus\\u2014except indirectly. Wuhan has 11 million people: Using the average mortality rate for China, that means approximately 213 people die there daily, as in any large city. Add in that it\\u2019s winter, and it\\u2019s flu season, and the conventional rate of death is even higher. Some of the videos are also mislabeled, or fakes; there\\u2019s a useful list being maintained here.\\n\\nNow remember that Wuhan\\u2019s health care system is completely flooded right now. Everyone with a cold is heading to the hospital to get checked, and medical staff are exhausted and overwhelmed. 150 army medical staff have been sent to help, and two emergency field hospital using prefabricated materials are being erected, but that\\u2019s unlikely to be enough. Those corpses are very likely people who died of regular causes but who simply haven\\u2019t been processed as they would in calmer times. As anyone who has been through Chinese health care knows, hospitals there are often chaotic places where patients regularly find themselves sitting with IVs in corridors, on the floor, or even in the parking lot; add in epidemic and quarantine, and everything falls apart. The regular medical number\\u2014120\\u2014is producing no response most of the time.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s one scary possibility here, though. Hospitals themselves could be becoming vectors for the virus. They\\u2019re already known to have infected at least 14 health care workers, and there are reports of widespread infection among medical staff who are running out of masks and gloves. Add to that patients crowding to get help, and even those whose symptoms are the result of ordinary colds rather than the virus might end up walking away infected.\\n\\nInside the quarantine zone, perhaps. A tremendous amount of fear is emerging in the patchy picture we get through social media. But there are no accounts of riots or disturbances or of clashes with police or attempts to escape the quarantine zone. That\\u2019s hopefully a good sign.\\n\\nOutside of Wuhan, people seem worried but calm. This is where some of China\\u2019s advantages, such as extensive networks of block workers and community centers, can come into play in keeping people informed without panic. There are runs on masks and hand sanitizer, which you\\u2019d expect. The most disturbing aspect may be the measures taken by some villages and townships, which are posting their own blockades to keep travelers out. That could get quite nasty, as anyone who has passed through a village gate late at night\\u2014where locals sometimes set up informal tollbooths, enforced by thugs\\u2014knows.\\n\\nThe control on information is probably helping to reduce potential panic and unjustified rumor, even as it may also be concealing vital facts. Chinese-language chat groups and forums in the United States, which lack those controls, seem far more panicked than those inside China itself, with extreme concern being shown over, for instance, visiting school groups from Wuhan and people warning others to stockpile medical supplies from CVS.\\n\\nThere are also widespread rumors among the Uighur diaspora\\u2014the Turkic minority persecuted by China in the Western region of Xinjiang; they\\u2019re expressing both fears that the original virus might have been a byproduct of Chinese bio-experimentation on Uighurs and more grounded worries that if the virus reaches the detention camps in which over a million Uighurs are held, the results could be a devastating infection.\\n\\nWhat about the political fallout?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s still very early days, but heads will almost certainly roll over the initial delay or cover-up. The central government has already made ominous noises. Given the usual pattern, this may well involve suddenly discovering that the Wuhan mayor, or local party leaders, was corrupt all along.\\n\\nIf the outbreak can be controlled, then this may be spun as a success for the system and a justification of authoritarian powers. If it isn\\u2019t, it\\u2019s a genuinely serious threat\\u2014not to Communist Party rule itself but to Xi. He\\u2019s already facing private dissent from members of the political-economic elite who believe he has mishandled national affairs. The disruption of a full-scale epidemic would be a perfect opportunity for his opponents to reveal themselves and move against him.\\n\\nThe top levels of the propaganda media\\u2014People\\u2019s Daily and the Xinwen Lianbo news broadcast\\u2014were still heavily downplaying the story until late in the week. People\\u2019s Daily hasn\\u2019t yet mentioned it on the front pages, which have been devoted entirely to praise of Xi and national prosperity; the story was buried on Page 4 on Wednesday, while it took the nightly news 22 minutes to reach the story. On Saturday, however, the broadcast led with a seven-minute meeting of the Central Committee, showing Xi in a leadership role.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s a contrast with previous disasters under Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, where the media led with images of national leadership and personal appearances. Wen, in particular, became sardonically nicknamed \\u201cthe best actor\\u201d for his kind but stern appearances in disaster zones, ordering local officials around and representing the paternal control of the party. Neither Xi nor premier Li Keqiang has visited Wuhan or announced plans to do so.\\n\\nThat might be simply because it\\u2019s far more difficult to protect a leader from a virus than from fire or flood. But it might also be a real fear that the epidemic will run out of control\\u2014and thus a desire to disassociate themselves from it as much as possible.\", \"author\": \"James Palmer\", \"url\": \"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/25/how-to-tell-whats-really-happening-with-the-wuhan-virus/\", \"published\": \"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 23:48:31 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580014111, \"collection_utc\": 1579999063}",News,1580014111

The quarantine in China has now extended to nearly 50 million people, as sweeping restrictions on travel are expanding daily out from the epicenter of the outbreak in the city of Wuhan.

China is struggling to cope with its worst health crisis since SARS in 2003, amid fears that Lunar New Year travel has already spread the infection far and wide.

The quarantine in China has now extended to nearly 50 million people, as sweeping restrictions on travel are expanding daily out from the epicenter of the outbreak in the city of Wuhan. These include bans on tour groups across the country, on long-distance travel in some cities, and on private transport in the center of Wuhan itself. The number of officially confirmed cases has reached 1,756, and continues to rise fast, with at least 54 dead, mostly elderly. China is struggling to cope with its worst health crisis since SARS in 2003, amid fears that Lunar New Year travel has already spread the infection far and wide. Every province and region in China, barring Tibet and Qinghai, both of which are geographically and politically isolated, has had cases of the virus. The United States has sent charter planes to evacuate its approximately 1,000 citizens and consular staff from the quarantine zone.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s too soon to tell, but quite probably not. The confirmed numbers may be just a fraction of the real total of infected victims, with many not yet diagnosed or even showing symptoms. But the biggest problem is that the long incubation period means hundreds of thousands of people left Wuhan long before the virus was seen as a major problem \\u2014especially as the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of people return to their families across China, was coming up. A lot now depends on where they ended up. The constant expansion of the quarantine zone, which now covers a huge chunk of the central Chinese province of Hubei, suggests that local transmission may have been fierce and fast, outrunning the authorities. Modeling by foreign scientists is producing disturbing results\\u2014250,000 or more infected inside Wuhan and large outbreaks elsewhere, with 60 percent or more of possible transmissions needing to be blocked to contain the outbreak.\\n\\nThe quarantine creates its own problems. Feeding and supplying the population inside, with regular logistical links severed, is a huge, though not impossible, task. China has exceptional logistics companies such as Alibaba, and they may be brought in, along with the military, to make sure shops stay supplied and people fed; long lines of trucks are heading into Wuhan to supply the population. That\\u2019s good, since Price gouging and shortages have already started.\\n\\nSo are we all going to die?\\n\\nProbably not. The coronavirus is highly worrying, but so far it lacks the pandemic properties of influenza and has a relatively low\\u2014experts believe\\u2014 mortality rate. The deaths so far have been mostly, but not exclusively, confined to older people, most of whom had preexisting conditions. The World Health Organization has declined to declare a global emergency, pointing to the relatively small number of cases outside China, although that could well change.\\n\\nThat said, many people remain in serious condition, and the virus has already mutated to pass from human to human\\u2014and could evolve further. At least one super-spreader\\u2014someone who passes the virus to an unusually high number of other victims\\u2014has already emerged in a Wuhan hospital.\\n\\nAnd while cases of infection appear to have been largely caught in foreign countries, thanks mostly to the victims being relatively well-off people who had access to health care resources, they\\u2019ve been popping up all over the place from Washington state to Malaysia. Given what seems to be a relatively long incubation period of seven to 12 days, during which victims can spread the virus without showing symptoms, it\\u2019s hard to tell just how far the virus has already reached.\\n\\nOn top of that, the range of symptoms is long, and some victims haven\\u2019t shown the most characteristic signs\\u2014and the ones being tested for\\u2014such as fever. The world could well see multiple outbreaks, especially if it reaches poorer and more vulnerable countries. Reports so far have been confined to developed nations like South Korea, France, and the United States, but it\\u2019s entirely possible that cases elsewhere have simply gone undetected.\\n\\nCan we trust the government figures right now?\\n\\nNo, for a variety of reasons. The first is that China has a record of concealing the numbers around disaster events for political reasons, from the initial cover-up around SARS to the regular underreporting of the number of dead from floods, landslides, industrial explosions, and other relatively routine disasters. In Wuhan\\u2019s case, it seems very likely that the leap to human-to-human transmission, and the sudden explosion in numbers, was concealed by local authorities keen not to risk the local economy or to disturb the smooth progress of the \\u201ctwo sessions,\\u201d important mid-January political meetings. The number of cases stayed at 41 for weeks and then suddenly jumped to more than 200 after the virus reached other countries a week ago. Meanwhile, Wuhan officials were scheduling large-scale public events right up until the quarantine was imposed.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s less reason for the central government to squash the numbers, and the enormous leap from 41 to more than 1300 cases this week may be the result of the sudden interest by Beijing in the epidemic. But government officials are also in the routine\\u2014and hard-to-break\\u2014habit of concealing information from the public, especially negative information. Huge amounts of resources are put into controlling and suppressing information in China, and doctors, reporters, and ordinary people have already been threatened or arrested for posting independently about the outbreak. A sudden flood of online posts today praised the government and criticized people for posting unauthorized information.\\n\\nChinese media is enjoying a short burst of relative freedom, with Caixin and other outlets producing some excellent and critical reporting. But that\\u2019s common in the aftermath of disaster in China; the sudden impetus of the news creates several days of comparative openness before the propaganda authorities decide and enforce new lines. (I saw it happen after the Sichuan earthquake and again after the Tianjin explosions when I worked in Chinese newsrooms.). Papers are already being forced to issue apologies if their reporters speak out of line. The internet might well be cut at some point, as happened in Xinjiang in 2009 after the riots there.\\n\\nEven if the government doesn\\u2019t want to distort data, its ability to gather information is also limited. Diagnostic test kits are in short supply, the population potentially affected is huge, and many poorer Chinese\\u2014those most affected\\u2014are out of reach for the state.\\n\\nThe scientific community in China is genuinely extremely concerned and attempting to share information as rapidly and transparently as it can with foreign counterparts. But it is also working within an environment where everything, even scientific research, is politicized. Since the ascent of Chinese President Xi Jinping to dictatorial status, many scientific papers begin with routine encomiums to Xi Jinping Thought, for instance.\\n\\nI keep seeing all these videos of dead bodies and people flooding Wuhan hospitals. What\\u2019s up with that?\\n\\nSeveral videos have emerged from Wuhan showing disturbing scenes at hospitals, such as bodies abandoned in corridors. But this doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re victims of the virus\\u2014except indirectly. Wuhan has 11 million people: Using the average mortality rate for China, that means approximately 213 people die there daily, as in any large city. Add in that it\\u2019s winter, and it\\u2019s flu season, and the conventional rate of death is even higher. Some of the videos are also mislabeled, or fakes; there\\u2019s a useful list being maintained here.\\n\\nNow remember that Wuhan\\u2019s health care system is completely flooded right now. Everyone with a cold is heading to the hospital to get checked, and medical staff are exhausted and overwhelmed. 150 army medical staff have been sent to help, and two emergency field hospital using prefabricated materials are being erected, but that\\u2019s unlikely to be enough.

The quarantine in China has now extended to nearly 50 million people, as sweeping restrictions on travel are expanding daily out from the epicenter of the outbreak in the city of Wuhan. These include bans on tour groups across the country, on long-distance travel in some cities, and on private transport in the center of Wuhan itself. The number of officially confirmed cases has reached 2,018, and continues to rise fast, with at least 56 dead, mostly elderly. China is struggling to cope with its worst health crisis since SARS in 2003, amid fears that Lunar New Year travel has already spread the infection far and wide. Every province and region in China, barring Tibet which is geographically and politically isolated, has had cases of the virus. The United States has sent charter planes to evacuate its approximately 1,000 citizens and consular staff from the quarantine zone.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s too soon to tell, but quite probably not. The confirmed numbers may be just a fraction of the real total of infected victims, with many not yet diagnosed or even showing symptoms. But the biggest problem is that the long incubation period means hundreds of thousands of people left Wuhan long before the virus was seen as a major problem\\u2014especially as the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of people return to their families across China, was coming up. A lot now depends on where they ended up. The constant expansion of the quarantine zone, which now covers a huge chunk of the central Chinese province of Hubei, suggests that local transmission may have been fierce and fast, outrunning the authorities. Modeling by foreign scientists is producing disturbing results\\u2014250,000 or more infected inside Wuhan and large outbreaks elsewhere, with 60 percent or more of possible transmissions needing to be blocked to contain the outbreak. [The authors of the original paper have since revised their estimations of the transmission rate down, though have not yet produced new figures for likely infections.]\\n\\nThe quarantine creates its own problems. Feeding and supplying the population inside, with regular logistical links severed, is a huge, though not impossible, task. China has exceptional logistics companies such as Alibaba, and they may be brought in, along with the military, to make sure shops stay supplied and people fed; long lines of trucks are heading into Wuhan to supply the population. That\\u2019s good, since price gouging and shortages have already started.\\n\\n[Monday, Jan. 27, at 11 a.m. ET\\u2014Join us for a timely FP Insider conference call on the Wuhan coronavirus.

Reserve your spot now.]\\n\\nSo are we all going to die?\\n\\nProbably not. The coronavirus is highly worrying, but so far it lacks the pandemic properties of influenza and has a relatively low\\u2014experts believe\\u2014mortality rate. The deaths so far have been mostly, but not exclusively, confined to older people, most of whom had preexisting conditions. The World Health Organization has declined to declare a global emergency, pointing to the relatively small number of cases outside China, although that could well change.\\n\\nThat said, many people remain in serious condition, and the virus has already mutated to pass from human to human\\u2014and could evolve further. At least one super-spreader\\u2014someone who passes the virus to an unusually high number of other victims\\u2014has already emerged in a Wuhan hospital.\\n\\nAnd while cases of infection appear to have been largely caught in foreign countries, thanks mostly to the victims being relatively well-off people who had access to health care resources, they\\u2019ve been popping up all over the place from Washington state to Malaysia. Given what seems to be a relatively long incubation period of seven to 12 days, during which victims can spread the virus without showing symptoms, it\\u2019s hard to tell just how far the virus has already reached.\\n\\nOn top of that, the range of symptoms is long, and some victims haven\\u2019t shown the most characteristic signs\\u2014and the ones being tested for\\u2014such as fever. The world could well see multiple outbreaks, especially if it reaches poorer and more vulnerable countries, as Laurie Garrett has highlighted. Reports so far have been confined to developed nations like South Korea, France, and the United States, but it\\u2019s entirely possible that cases elsewhere have simply gone undetected.\\n\\nCan we trust the government figures right now?\\n\\nNo, for a variety of reasons. The first is that China has a record of concealing the numbers around disaster events for political reasons, from the initial cover-up around SARS to the regular underreporting of the number of dead from floods, landslides, industrial explosions, and other relatively routine disasters. In Wuhan\\u2019s case, it seems very likely that the leap to human-to-human transmission, and the sudden explosion in numbers, was concealed by local authorities keen not to risk the local economy or to disturb the smooth progress of the \\u201ctwo sessions,\\u201d important mid-January political meetings. The number of cases stayed at 41 for weeks and then suddenly jumped to more than 200 after the virus reached other countries a week ago. Meanwhile, Wuhan officials were scheduling large-scale public events right up until the quarantine was imposed.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s less reason for the central government to squash the numbers, and the enormous leap from 41 to nearly 2,000 cases this week may be the result of the sudden interest by Beijing in the epidemic. But government officials are also in the routine\\u2014and hard-to-break\\u2014habit of concealing information from the public, especially negative information. Huge amounts of resources are put into controlling and suppressing information in China, and doctors, reporters, and ordinary people have already been threatened or arrested for posting independently about the outbreak. A sudden flood of online posts today praised the government and criticized people for posting unauthorized information.\\n\\nChinese media is enjoying a short burst of relative freedom, with Caixin and other outlets producing some excellent and critical reporting. But that\\u2019s common in the aftermath of disaster in China; the sudden impetus of the news creates several days of comparative openness before the propaganda authorities decide and enforce new lines. (I saw it happen after the Sichuan earthquake and again after the Tianjin explosions when I worked in Chinese newsrooms.). Papers are already being forced to issue apologies if their reporters speak out of line. The internet might well be cut at some point, as happened in Xinjiang in 2009 after the riots there.\\n\\nEven if the government doesn\\u2019t want to distort data, its ability to gather information is also limited. Diagnostic test kits are in short supply, the population potentially affected is huge, and many poorer Chinese\\u2014those most affected\\u2014are out of reach for the state.\\n\\nThe scientific community in China is genuinely extremely concerned and attempting to share information as rapidly and transparently as it can with foreign counterparts. But it is also working within an environment where everything, even scientific research, is politicized. Since the ascent of Chinese President Xi Jinping to dictatorial status, many scientific papers begin with routine encomiums to Xi Jinping Thought, for instance.\\n\\nI keep seeing all these videos of dead bodies and people flooding Wuhan hospitals. What\\u2019s up with that?\\n\\nSeveral videos have emerged from Wuhan showing disturbing scenes at hospitals, such as bodies abandoned in corridors. But this doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re victims of the virus\\u2014except indirectly. Wuhan has 11 million people: Using the average mortality rate for China, that means approximately 213 people die there daily, as in any large city. Add in that it\\u2019s winter, and it\\u2019s flu season, and the conventional rate of death is even higher. Some of the videos are also mislabeled, or fakes; there\\u2019s a useful list being maintained here.\\n\\nNow remember that Wuhan\\u2019s health care system is completely flooded right now. Everyone with a cold is heading to the hospital to get checked, and medical staff are exhausted and overwhelmed. 450 army medical staff have been sent to help, and two emergency field hospital using prefabricated materials are being erected, but that\\u2019s unlikely to be enough. Those corpses are very likely people who died of regular causes but who simply haven\\u2019t been processed as they would in calmer times. As anyone who has been through Chinese health care knows, hospitals there are often chaotic places where patients regularly find themselves sitting with IVs in corridors, on the floor, or even in the parking lot; add in epidemic and quarantine, and everything falls apart. The regular medical number\\u2014120\\u2014is producing no response most of the time.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s one scary possibility here, though. Hospitals themselves could be becoming vectors for the virus. They\\u2019re already known to have infected at least 14 health care workers, and there are reports of widespread infection among medical staff who are running out of masks and gloves. Add to that patients crowding to get help, and even those whose symptoms are the result of ordinary colds rather than the virus might end up walking away infected.\\n\\nInside the quarantine zone, perhaps. A tremendous amount of fear is emerging in the patchy picture we get through social media. But there are no accounts of riots or disturbances or of clashes with police or attempts to escape the quarantine zone. That\\u2019s hopefully a good sign.\\n\\nOutside of Wuhan, people seem worried but calm. This is where some of China\\u2019s advantages, such as extensive networks of block workers and community centers, can come into play in keeping people informed without panic. There are runs on masks and hand sanitizer, which you\\u2019d expect. The most disturbing aspect may be the measures taken by some villages and townships, which are posting their own blockades to keep travelers out. That could get quite nasty, as anyone who has passed through a village gate late at night\\u2014where locals sometimes set up informal tollbooths, enforced by thugs\\u2014knows.\\n\\nThe control on information is probably helping to reduce potential panic and unjustified rumor, even as it may also be concealing vital facts. Chinese-language chat groups and forums in the United States, which lack those controls, seem far more panicked than those inside China itself, with extreme concern being shown over, for instance, visiting school groups from Wuhan and people warning others to stockpile medical supplies from CVS.\\n\\nThere are also widespread rumors among the Uighur diaspora\\u2014the Turkic minority persecuted by China in the Western region of Xinjiang; they\\u2019re expressing both fears that the original virus might have been a byproduct of Chinese bio-experimentation on Uighurs and more grounded worries that if the virus reaches the detention camps in which over a million Uighurs are held, the results could be a devastating infection.\\n\\nWhat about the political fallout?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s still very early days, but heads will almost certainly roll over the initial delay or cover-up. The central government has already made ominous noises. Given the usual pattern, this may well involve suddenly discovering that the Wuhan mayor, or local party leaders, was corrupt all along.\\n\\nIf the outbreak can be controlled, then this may be spun as a success for the system and a justification of authoritarian powers. If it isn\\u2019t, it\\u2019s a genuinely serious threat\\u2014not to Communist Party rule itself but to Xi. He\\u2019s already facing private dissent from members of the political-economic elite who believe he has mishandled national affairs. The disruption of a full-scale epidemic would be a perfect opportunity for his opponents to reveal themselves and move against him.\\n\\nThe top levels of the propaganda media\\u2014People\\u2019s Daily and the Xinwen Lianbo news broadcast\\u2014were still heavily downplaying the story until late in the week. People\\u2019s Daily hasn\\u2019t yet mentioned it on the front pages, which have been devoted entirely to praise of Xi and national prosperity; the story was buried on Page 4 on Wednesday, while it took the nightly news 22 minutes to reach the story. On Saturday, however, the broadcast led with a seven-minute meeting of the Central Committee, showing Xi in a leadership role.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s a contrast with previous disasters under Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, where the media led with images of national leadership and personal appearances. Wen, in particular, became sardonically nicknamed \\u201cthe best actor\\u201d for his kind but stern appearances in disaster zones, ordering local officials around and representing the paternal control of the party. Neither Xi nor premier Li Keqiang has visited Wuhan or announced plans to do so.\\n\\nThat might be simply because it\\u2019s far more difficult to protect a leader from a virus than from fire or flood. But it might also be a real fear that the epidemic will run out of control\\u2014and thus a desire to disassociate themselves from it as much as possible.\", \"author\": \"James Palmer\", \"url\": \"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/25/how-to-tell-whats-really-happening-with-the-wuhan-virus/\", \"published\": \"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 23:48:31 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580014111, \"collection_utc\": 1580085147}",News,1580014111

The World Health Organization has declined to declare a global emergency, pointing to the relatively small number of cases outside China, although that could well change.\\n\\nThat said, many people remain in serious condition, and the virus has already mutated to pass from human to human\\u2014and could evolve further. At least one super-spreader\\u2014someone who passes the virus to an unusually high number of other victims\\u2014has already emerged in a Wuhan hospital.\\n\\nAnd while cases of infection appear to have been largely caught in foreign countries, thanks mostly to the victims being relatively well-off people who had access to health care resources, they\\u2019ve been popping up all over the place from Washington state to Malaysia. Given what seems to be a relatively long incubation period of seven to 12 days, during which victims can spread the virus without showing symptoms, it\\u2019s hard to tell just how far the virus has already reached.\\n\\nOn top of that, the range of symptoms is long, and some victims haven\\u2019t shown the most characteristic signs\\u2014and the ones being tested for\\u2014such as fever. The world could well see multiple outbreaks, especially if it reaches poorer and more vulnerable countries, as Laurie Garrett has highlighted. Reports so far have been confined to developed nations like South Korea, France, and the United States, but it\\u2019s entirely possible that cases elsewhere have simply gone undetected.\\n\\nCan we trust the government figures right now?\\n\\nNo, for a variety of reasons. The first is that China has a record of concealing the numbers around disaster events for political reasons, from the initial cover-up around SARS to the regular underreporting of the number of dead from floods, landslides, industrial explosions, and other relatively routine disasters. In Wuhan\\u2019s case, it seems very likely that the leap to human-to-human transmission, and the sudden explosion in numbers, was concealed by local authorities keen not to risk the local economy or to disturb the smooth progress of the \\u201ctwo sessions,\\u201d important mid-January political meetings. The number of cases stayed at 41 for weeks and then suddenly jumped to more than 200 after the virus reached other countries a week ago. Meanwhile, Wuhan officials were scheduling large-scale public events right up until the quarantine was imposed.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s less reason for the central government to squash the numbers, and the enormous leap from 41 to nearly 2,000 cases this week may be the result of the sudden interest by Beijing in the epidemic. But government officials are also in the routine\\u2014and hard-to-break\\u2014habit of concealing information from the public, especially negative information. Huge amounts of resources are put into controlling and suppressing information in China, and doctors, reporters, and ordinary people have already been threatened or arrested for posting independently about the outbreak. A sudden flood of online posts today praised the government and criticized people for posting unauthorized information.\\n\\nChinese media is enjoying a short burst of relative freedom, with Caixin and other outlets producing some excellent and critical reporting. But that\\u2019s common in the aftermath of disaster in China; the sudden impetus of the news creates several days of comparative openness before the propaganda authorities decide and enforce new lines. (I saw it happen after the Sichuan earthquake and again after the Tianjin explosions when I worked in Chinese newsrooms.). Papers are already being forced to issue apologies if their reporters speak out of line. The internet might well be cut at some point, as happened in Xinjiang in 2009 after the riots there.\\n\\nEven if the government doesn\\u2019t want to distort data, its ability to gather information is also limited. Diagnostic test kits are in short supply, the population potentially affected is huge, and many poorer Chinese\\u2014those most affected\\u2014are out of reach for the state.\\n\\nThe scientific community in China is genuinely extremely concerned and attempting to share information as rapidly and transparently as it can with foreign counterparts. But it is also working within an environment where everything, even scientific research, is politicized. Since the ascent of Chinese President Xi Jinping to dictatorial status, many scientific papers begin with routine encomiums to Xi Jinping Thought, for instance.\\n\\nI keep seeing all these videos of dead bodies and people flooding Wuhan hospitals. What\\u2019s up with that?\\n\\nSeveral videos have emerged from Wuhan showing disturbing scenes at hospitals, such as bodies abandoned in corridors. But this doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re victims of the virus\\u2014except indirectly. Wuhan has 11 million people: Using the average mortality rate for China, that means approximately 213 people die there daily, as in any large city. Add in that it\\u2019s winter, and it\\u2019s flu season, and the conventional rate of death is even higher. Some of the videos are also mislabeled, or fakes; there\\u2019s a useful list being maintained here.\\n\\nNow remember that Wuhan\\u2019s health care system is completely flooded right now. Everyone with a cold is heading to the hospital to get checked, and medical staff are exhausted and overwhelmed. 450 army medical staff have been sent to help, and two emergency field hospital using prefabricated materials are being erected, but that\\u2019s unlikely to be enough. Those corpses are very likely people who died of regular causes but who simply haven\\u2019t been processed as they would in calmer times. As anyone who has been through Chinese health care knows, hospitals there are often chaotic places where patients regularly find themselves sitting with IVs in corridors, on the floor, or even in the parking lot; add in epidemic and quarantine, and everything falls apart. The regular medical number\\u2014120\\u2014is producing no response most of the time.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s one scary possibility here, though. Hospitals themselves could be becoming vectors for the virus. They\\u2019re already known to have infected at least 14 health care workers, and there are reports of widespread infection among medical staff who are running out of masks and gloves. Add to that patients crowding to get help, and even those whose symptoms are the result of ordinary colds rather than the virus might end up walking away infected.\\n\\nInside the quarantine zone, perhaps. A tremendous amount of fear is emerging in the patchy picture we get through social media. But there are no accounts of riots or disturbances or of clashes with police or attempts to escape the quarantine zone. That\\u2019s hopefully a good sign.\\n\\nOutside of Wuhan, people seem worried but calm. This is where some of China\\u2019s advantages, such as extensive networks of block workers and community centers, can come into play in keeping people informed without panic. There are runs on masks and hand sanitizer, which you\\u2019d expect. The most disturbing aspect may be the measures taken by some villages and townships, which are posting their own blockades to keep travelers out. That could get quite nasty, as anyone who has passed through a village gate late at night\\u2014where locals sometimes set up informal tollbooths, enforced by thugs\\u2014knows.\\n\\nThe control on information is probably helping to reduce potential panic and unjustified rumor, even as it may also be concealing vital facts. Chinese-language chat groups and forums in the United States, which lack those controls, seem far more panicked than those inside China itself, with extreme concern being shown over, for instance, visiting school groups from Wuhan and people warning others to stockpile medical supplies from CVS.\\n\\nThere are also widespread rumors among the Uighur diaspora\\u2014the Turkic minority persecuted by China in the Western region of Xinjiang; they\\u2019re expressing both fears that the original virus might have been a byproduct of Chinese bio-experimentation on Uighurs and more grounded worries that if the virus reaches the detention camps in which over a million Uighurs are held, the results could be a devastating infection.\\n\\nWhat about the political fallout?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s still very early days, but heads will almost certainly roll over the initial delay or cover-up. The central government has already made ominous noises. Given the usual pattern, this may well involve suddenly discovering that the Wuhan mayor, or local party leaders, was corrupt all along.\\n\\nIf the outbreak can be controlled, then this may be spun as a success for the system and a justification of authoritarian powers. If it isn\\u2019t, it\\u2019s a genuinely serious threat\\u2014not to Communist Party rule itself but to Xi. He\\u2019s already facing private dissent from members of the political-economic elite who believe he has mishandled national affairs. The disruption of a full-scale epidemic would be a perfect opportunity for his opponents to reveal themselves and move against him.\\n\\nThe top levels of the propaganda media\\u2014People\\u2019s Daily and the Xinwen Lianbo news broadcast\\u2014were still heavily downplaying the story until late in the week. People\\u2019s Daily hasn\\u2019t yet mentioned it on the front pages, which have been devoted entirely to praise of Xi and national prosperity; the story was buried on Page 4 on Wednesday, while it took the nightly news 22 minutes to reach the story. On Saturday, however, the broadcast led with a seven-minute meeting of the Central Committee, showing Xi in a leadership role.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s a contrast with previous disasters under Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, where the media led with images of national leadership and personal appearances. Wen, in particular, became sardonically nicknamed \\u201cthe best actor\\u201d for his kind but stern appearances in disaster zones, ordering local officials around and representing the paternal control of the party. Neither Xi nor premier Li Keqiang has visited Wuhan or announced plans to do so.\\n\\nThat might be simply because it\\u2019s far more difficult to protect a leader from a virus than from fire or flood. But it might also be a real fear that the epidemic will run out of control\\u2014and thus a desire to disassociate themselves from it as much as possible.\", \"author\": \"James Palmer\", \"url\": \"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/25/how-to-tell-whats-really-happening-with-the-wuhan-virus/\", \"published\": \"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 23:48:31 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580014111, \"collection_utc\": 1580085147}",News,1580014111

Add in that it\\u2019s winter, and it\\u2019s flu season, and the conventional rate of death is even higher. Some of the videos are also mislabeled, or fakes; there\\u2019s a useful list being maintained here.\\n\\nNow remember that Wuhan\\u2019s health care system is completely flooded right now. Everyone with a cold is heading to the hospital to get checked, and medical staff are exhausted and overwhelmed. 450 army medical staff have been sent to help, and two emergency field hospital using prefabricated materials are being erected, but that\\u2019s unlikely to be enough. Those corpses are very likely people who died of regular causes but who simply haven\\u2019t been processed as they would in calmer times. As anyone who has been through Chinese health care knows, hospitals there are often chaotic places where patients regularly find themselves sitting with IVs in corridors, on the floor, or even in the parking lot; add in epidemic and quarantine, and everything falls apart. The regular medical number\\u2014120\\u2014is producing no response most of the time.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s one scary possibility here, though. Hospitals themselves could be becoming vectors for the virus. They\\u2019re already known to have infected at least 14 health care workers, and there are reports of widespread infection among medical staff who are running out of masks and gloves. Add to that patients crowding to get help, and even those whose symptoms are the result of ordinary colds rather than the virus might end up walking away infected.\\n\\nInside the quarantine zone, perhaps. A tremendous amount of fear is emerging in the patchy picture we get through social media. But there are no accounts of riots or disturbances or of clashes with police or attempts to escape the quarantine zone. That\\u2019s hopefully a good sign.\\n\\nOutside of Wuhan, people seem worried but calm. This is where some of China\\u2019s advantages, such as extensive networks of block workers and community centers, can come into play in keeping people informed without panic. There are runs on masks and hand sanitizer, which you\\u2019d expect. The most disturbing aspect may be the measures taken by some villages and townships, which are posting their own blockades to keep travelers out. That could get quite nasty, as anyone who has passed through a village gate late at night\\u2014where locals sometimes set up informal tollbooths, enforced by thugs\\u2014knows.\\n\\nThe control on information is probably helping to reduce potential panic and unjustified rumor, even as it may also be concealing vital facts. Chinese-language chat groups and forums in the United States, which lack those controls, seem far more panicked than those inside China itself, with extreme concern being shown over, for instance, visiting school groups from Wuhan and people warning others to stockpile medical supplies from CVS.\\n\\nThere are also widespread rumors among the Uighur diaspora\\u2014the Turkic minority persecuted by China in the Western region of Xinjiang; they\\u2019re expressing both fears that the original virus might have been a byproduct of Chinese bio-experimentation on Uighurs and more grounded worries that if the virus reaches the detention camps in which over a million Uighurs are held, the results could be a devastating infection.\\n\\nWhat about the political fallout?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s still very early days, but heads will almost certainly roll over the initial delay or cover-up. The central government has already made ominous noises. Given the usual pattern, this may well involve suddenly discovering that the Wuhan mayor, or local party leaders, was corrupt all along.\\n\\nIf the outbreak can be controlled, then this may be spun as a success for the system and a justification of authoritarian powers. If it isn\\u2019t, it\\u2019s a genuinely serious threat\\u2014not to Communist Party rule itself but to Xi. He\\u2019s already facing private dissent from members of the political-economic elite who believe he has mishandled national affairs. The disruption of a full-scale epidemic would be a perfect opportunity for his opponents to reveal themselves and move against him.\\n\\nThe top levels of the propaganda media\\u2014People\\u2019s Daily and the Xinwen Lianbo news broadcast\\u2014were still heavily downplaying the story until late in the week. People\\u2019s Daily hasn\\u2019t yet mentioned it on the front pages, which have been devoted entirely to praise of Xi and national prosperity; the story was buried on Page 4 on Wednesday, while it took the nightly news 22 minutes to reach the story. On Saturday, however, the broadcast led with a seven-minute meeting of the Central Committee, showing Xi in a leadership role.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s a contrast with previous disasters under Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, where the media led with images of national leadership and personal appearances. Wen, in particular, became sardonically nicknamed \\u201cthe best actor\\u201d for his kind but stern appearances in disaster zones, ordering local officials around and representing the paternal control of the party. Neither Xi nor premier Li Keqiang has visited Wuhan or announced plans to do so.\\n\\nThat might be simply because it\\u2019s far more difficult to protect a leader from a virus than from fire or flood. But it might also be a real fear that the epidemic will run out of control\\u2014and thus a desire to disassociate themselves from it as much as possible.\", \"author\": \"James Palmer\", \"url\": \"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/25/how-to-tell-whats-really-happening-with-the-wuhan-virus/\", \"published\": \"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 23:48:31 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580014111, \"collection_utc\": 1580085147}",News,1580014111

The quarantine in China has now extended to nearly 50 million people, as sweeping restrictions on travel are expanding daily out from the epicenter of the outbreak in the city of Wuhan. These include bans on tour groups across the country, on long-distance travel in some cities, and on private transport in the center of Wuhan itself. The number of officially confirmed cases has reached 2,018, and continues to rise fast, with at least 56 dead, mostly elderly. China is struggling to cope with its worst health crisis since SARS in 2003, amid fears that Lunar New Year travel has already spread the infection far and wide. Every province and region in China, barring Tibet which is geographically and politically isolated, has had cases of the virus. The United States has sent charter planes to evacuate its approximately 1,000 citizens and consular staff from the quarantine zone.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s too soon to tell, but quite probably not. The confirmed numbers may be just a fraction of the real total of infected victims, with many not yet diagnosed or even showing symptoms. But the biggest problem is that the long incubation period means hundreds of thousands of people left Wuhan long before the virus was seen as a major problem\\u2014especially as the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of people return to their families across China, was coming up. A lot now depends on where they ended up. The constant expansion of the quarantine zone, which now covers a huge chunk of the central Chinese province of Hubei, suggests that local transmission may have been fierce and fast, outrunning the authorities.

Reserve your spot now.]\\n\\nSo are we all going to die?\\n\\nProbably not. The coronavirus is highly worrying, but so far it lacks the pandemic properties of influenza and has a relatively low\\u2014experts believe\\u2014mortality rate. The deaths so far have been mostly, but not exclusively, confined to older people, most of whom had preexisting conditions. The World Health Organization has declined to declare a global emergency, pointing to the relatively small number of cases outside China, although that could well change.\\n\\nThat said, many people remain in serious condition, and the virus has already mutated to pass from human to human\\u2014and could evolve further. At least one super-spreader\\u2014someone who passes the virus to an unusually high number of other victims\\u2014has already emerged in a Wuhan hospital.\\n\\nAnd while cases of infection appear to have been largely caught in foreign countries, thanks mostly to the victims being relatively well-off people who had access to health care resources, they\\u2019ve been popping up all over the place from Washington state to Malaysia. Given what seems to be a relatively long incubation period of seven to 12 days, during which victims can spread the virus without showing symptoms, it\\u2019s hard to tell just how far the virus has already reached.\\n\\nOn top of that, the range of symptoms is long, and some victims haven\\u2019t shown the most characteristic signs\\u2014and the ones being tested for\\u2014such as fever. The world could well see multiple outbreaks, especially if it reaches poorer and more vulnerable countries, as Laurie Garrett has highlighted. Reports so far have been confined to developed nations like South Korea, France, and the United States, but it\\u2019s entirely possible that cases elsewhere have simply gone undetected.\\n\\nCan we trust the government figures right now?\\n\\nNo, for a variety of reasons. The first is that China has a record of concealing the numbers around disaster events for political reasons, from the initial cover-up around SARS to the regular underreporting of the number of dead from floods, landslides, industrial explosions, and other relatively routine disasters. In Wuhan\\u2019s case, it seems very likely that the leap to human-to-human transmission, and the sudden explosion in numbers, was concealed by local authorities keen not to risk the local economy or to disturb the smooth progress of the \\u201ctwo sessions,\\u201d important mid-January political meetings. The number of cases stayed at 41 for weeks and then suddenly jumped to more than 200 after the virus reached other countries a week ago. Meanwhile, Wuhan officials were scheduling large-scale public events right up until the quarantine was imposed.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s less reason for the central government to squash the numbers, and the enormous leap from 41 to nearly 2,000 cases this week may be the result of the sudden interest by Beijing in the epidemic. But government officials are also in the routine\\u2014and hard-to-break\\u2014habit of concealing information from the public, especially negative information. Huge amounts of resources are put into controlling and suppressing information in China, and doctors, reporters, and ordinary people have already been threatened or arrested for posting independently about the outbreak. A sudden flood of online posts today praised the government and criticized people for posting unauthorized information.\\n\\nChinese media is enjoying a short burst of relative freedom, with Caixin and other outlets producing some excellent and critical reporting. But that\\u2019s common in the aftermath of disaster in China; the sudden impetus of the news creates several days of comparative openness before the propaganda authorities decide and enforce new lines. (I saw it happen after the Sichuan earthquake and again after the Tianjin explosions when I worked in Chinese newsrooms.). Papers are already being forced to issue apologies if their reporters speak out of line. The internet might well be cut at some point, as happened in Xinjiang in 2009 after the riots there.\\n\\nEven if the government doesn\\u2019t want to distort data, its ability to gather information is also limited. Diagnostic test kits are in short supply, the population potentially affected is huge, and many poorer Chinese\\u2014those most affected\\u2014are out of reach for the state.\\n\\nThe scientific community in China is genuinely extremely concerned and attempting to share information as rapidly and transparently as it can with foreign counterparts. But it is also working within an environment where everything, even scientific research, is politicized. Since the ascent of Chinese President Xi Jinping to dictatorial status, many scientific papers begin with routine encomiums to Xi Jinping Thought, for instance.\\n\\nI keep seeing all these videos of dead bodies and people flooding Wuhan hospitals. What\\u2019s up with that?\\n\\nSeveral videos have emerged from Wuhan showing disturbing scenes at hospitals, such as bodies abandoned in corridors. But this doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re victims of the virus\\u2014except indirectly. Wuhan has 11 million people: Using the average mortality rate for China, that means approximately 213 people die there daily, as in any large city.

The quarantine in China has now extended to nearly 50 million people, as sweeping restrictions on travel are expanding daily out from the epicenter of the outbreak in the city of Wuhan. These include bans on tour groups across the country, on long-distance travel in some cities, and on private transport in the center of Wuhan itself. The number of officially confirmed cases has reached 2,018, and continues to rise fast, with at least 56 dead, mostly elderly. China is struggling to cope with its worst health crisis since SARS in 2003, amid fears that Lunar New Year travel has already spread the infection far and wide.

Reserve your spot now.]\\n\\nSo are we all going to die?\\n\\nProbably not. The coronavirus is highly worrying, but so far it lacks the pandemic properties of influenza and has a relatively low\\u2014experts believe\\u2014mortality rate. The deaths so far have been mostly, but not exclusively, confined to older people, most of whom had preexisting conditions. The World Health Organization has declined to declare a global emergency, pointing to the relatively small number of cases outside China, although that could well change.\\n\\nThat said, many people remain in serious condition, and the virus has already mutated to pass from human to human\\u2014and could evolve further. At least one super-spreader\\u2014someone who passes the virus to an unusually high number of other victims\\u2014has already emerged in a Wuhan hospital.\\n\\nAnd while cases of infection appear to have been largely caught in foreign countries, thanks mostly to the victims being relatively well-off people who had access to health care resources, they\\u2019ve been popping up all over the place from Washington state to Malaysia. Given what seems to be a relatively long incubation period of seven to 12 days, during which victims can spread the virus without showing symptoms, it\\u2019s hard to tell just how far the virus has already reached.\\n\\nOn top of that, the range of symptoms is long, and some victims haven\\u2019t shown the most characteristic signs\\u2014and the ones being tested for\\u2014such as fever. The world could well see multiple outbreaks, especially if it reaches poorer and more vulnerable countries, as Laurie Garrett has highlighted. Reports so far have been confined to developed nations like South Korea, France, and the United States, but it\\u2019s entirely possible that cases elsewhere have simply gone undetected.\\n\\nCan we trust the government figures right now?\\n\\nNo, for a variety of reasons. The first is that China has a record of concealing the numbers around disaster events for political reasons, from the initial cover-up around SARS to the regular underreporting of the number of dead from floods, landslides, industrial explosions, and other relatively routine disasters. In Wuhan\\u2019s case, it seems very likely that the leap to human-to-human transmission, and the sudden explosion in numbers, was concealed by local authorities keen not to risk the local economy or to disturb the smooth progress of the \\u201ctwo sessions,\\u201d important mid-January political meetings. The number of cases stayed at 41 for weeks and then suddenly jumped to more than 200 after the virus reached other countries a week ago. Meanwhile, Wuhan officials were scheduling large-scale public events right up until the quarantine was imposed.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s less reason for the central government to squash the numbers, and the enormous leap from 41 to nearly 2,000 cases this week may be the result of the sudden interest by Beijing in the epidemic. But government officials are also in the routine\\u2014and hard-to-break\\u2014habit of concealing information from the public, especially negative information. Huge amounts of resources are put into controlling and suppressing information in China, and doctors, reporters, and ordinary people have already been threatened or arrested for posting independently about the outbreak. A sudden flood of online posts today praised the government and criticized people for posting unauthorized information.\\n\\nChinese media is enjoying a short burst of relative freedom, with Caixin and other outlets producing some excellent and critical reporting. But that\\u2019s common in the aftermath of disaster in China; the sudden impetus of the news creates several days of comparative openness before the propaganda authorities decide and enforce new lines. (I saw it happen after the Sichuan earthquake and again after the Tianjin explosions when I worked in Chinese newsrooms.). Papers are already being forced to issue apologies if their reporters speak out of line. The internet might well be cut at some point, as happened in Xinjiang in 2009 after the riots there.\\n\\nEven if the government doesn\\u2019t want to distort data, its ability to gather information is also limited. Diagnostic test kits are in short supply, the population potentially affected is huge, and many poorer Chinese\\u2014those most affected\\u2014are out of reach for the state.\\n\\nThe scientific community in China is genuinely extremely concerned and attempting to share information as rapidly and transparently as it can with foreign counterparts. But it is also working within an environment where everything, even scientific research, is politicized. Since the ascent of Chinese President Xi Jinping to dictatorial status, many scientific papers begin with routine encomiums to Xi Jinping Thought, for instance.\\n\\nI keep seeing all these videos of dead bodies and people flooding Wuhan hospitals. What\\u2019s up with that?\\n\\nSeveral videos have emerged from Wuhan showing disturbing scenes at hospitals, such as bodies abandoned in corridors. But this doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re victims of the virus\\u2014except indirectly. Wuhan has 11 million people: Using the average mortality rate for China, that means approximately 213 people die there daily, as in any large city. Add in that it\\u2019s winter, and it\\u2019s flu season, and the conventional rate of death is even higher. Some of the videos are also mislabeled, or fakes; there\\u2019s a useful list being maintained here.\\n\\nNow remember that Wuhan\\u2019s health care system is completely flooded right now. Everyone with a cold is heading to the hospital to get checked, and medical staff are exhausted and overwhelmed. 450 army medical staff have been sent to help, and two emergency field hospital using prefabricated materials are being erected, but that\\u2019s unlikely to be enough. Those corpses are very likely people who died of regular causes but who simply haven\\u2019t been processed as they would in calmer times. As anyone who has been through Chinese health care knows, hospitals there are often chaotic places where patients regularly find themselves sitting with IVs in corridors, on the floor, or even in the parking lot; add in epidemic and quarantine, and everything falls apart. The regular medical number\\u2014120\\u2014is producing no response most of the time.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s one scary possibility here, though. Hospitals themselves could be becoming vectors for the virus. They\\u2019re already known to have infected at least 14 health care workers, and there are reports of widespread infection among medical staff who are running out of masks and gloves. Add to that patients crowding to get help, and even those whose symptoms are the result of ordinary colds rather than the virus might end up walking away infected.\\n\\nInside the quarantine zone, perhaps. A tremendous amount of fear is emerging in the patchy picture we get through social media. But there are no accounts of riots or disturbances or of clashes with police or attempts to escape the quarantine zone. That\\u2019s hopefully a good sign.\\n\\nOutside of Wuhan, people seem worried but calm. This is where some of China\\u2019s advantages, such as extensive networks of block workers and community centers, can come into play in keeping people informed without panic. There are runs on masks and hand sanitizer, which you\\u2019d expect. The most disturbing aspect may be the measures taken by some villages and townships, which are posting their own blockades to keep travelers out. That could get quite nasty, as anyone who has passed through a village gate late at night\\u2014where locals sometimes set up informal tollbooths, enforced by thugs\\u2014knows.\\n\\nThe control on information is probably helping to reduce potential panic and unjustified rumor, even as it may also be concealing vital facts. Chinese-language chat groups and forums in the United States, which lack those controls, seem far more panicked than those inside China itself, with extreme concern being shown over, for instance, visiting school groups from Wuhan and people warning others to stockpile medical supplies from CVS.\\n\\nThere are also widespread rumors among the Uighur diaspora\\u2014the Turkic minority persecuted by China in the Western region of Xinjiang; they\\u2019re expressing both fears that the original virus might have been a byproduct of Chinese bio-experimentation on Uighurs and more grounded worries that if the virus reaches the detention camps in which over a million Uighurs are held, the results could be a devastating infection.\\n\\nWhat about the political fallout?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s still very early days, but heads will almost certainly roll over the initial delay or cover-up. The central government has already made ominous noises. Given the usual pattern, this may well involve suddenly discovering that the Wuhan mayor, or local party leaders, was corrupt all along.\\n\\nIf the outbreak can be controlled, then this may be spun as a success for the system and a justification of authoritarian powers. If it isn\\u2019t, it\\u2019s a genuinely serious threat\\u2014not to Communist Party rule itself but to Xi. He\\u2019s already facing private dissent from members of the political-economic elite who believe he has mishandled national affairs. The disruption of a full-scale epidemic would be a perfect opportunity for his opponents to reveal themselves and move against him.\\n\\nThe top levels of the propaganda media\\u2014People\\u2019s Daily and the Xinwen Lianbo news broadcast\\u2014were still heavily downplaying the story until late in the week.

China has exceptional logistics companies such as Alibaba, and they may be brought in, along with the military, to make sure shops stay supplied and people fed; long lines of trucks are heading into Wuhan to supply the population. That\\u2019s good, since price gouging and shortages have already started.\\n\\n[Monday, Jan. 27, at 11 a.m. ET\\u2014Join us for a timely FP Insider conference call on the Wuhan coronavirus. What can be done to stop the epidemic? What are the business and political impacts? And how can regular people stay safe? FP managing editor Ravi Agrawal and expert guests Laurie Garrett, Pulitzer Prize-winning FP science columnist, and James Palmer, FP senior editor and China Brief newsletter author, will give answers and take your questions. Reserve your spot now.]\\n\\nSo are we all going to die?\\n\\nProbably not. The coronavirus is highly worrying, but so far it lacks the pandemic properties of influenza and has a relatively low\\u2014experts believe\\u2014mortality rate. The deaths so far have been mostly, but not exclusively, confined to older people, most of whom had preexisting conditions. The World Health Organization has declined to declare a global emergency, pointing to the relatively small number of cases outside China, although that could well change.\\n\\nThat said, many people remain in serious condition, and the virus has already mutated to pass from human to human\\u2014and could evolve further. At least one super-spreader\\u2014someone who passes the virus to an unusually high number of other victims\\u2014has already emerged in a Wuhan hospital.\\n\\nAnd while cases of infection appear to have been largely caught in foreign countries, thanks mostly to the victims being relatively well-off people who had access to health care resources, they\\u2019ve been popping up all over the place from Washington state to Malaysia. Given what seems to be a relatively long incubation period of seven to 12 days, during which victims can spread the virus without showing symptoms, it\\u2019s hard to tell just how far the virus has already reached.\\n\\nOn top of that, the range of symptoms is long, and some victims haven\\u2019t shown the most characteristic signs\\u2014and the ones being tested for\\u2014such as fever. The world could well see multiple outbreaks, especially if it reaches poorer and more vulnerable countries, as Laurie Garrett has highlighted. Reports so far have been confined to developed nations like South Korea, France, and the United States, but it\\u2019s entirely possible that cases elsewhere have simply gone undetected.\\n\\nCan we trust the government figures right now?\\n\\nNo, for a variety of reasons. The first is that China has a record of concealing the numbers around disaster events for political reasons, from the initial cover-up around SARS to the regular underreporting of the number of dead from floods, landslides, industrial explosions, and other relatively routine disasters. In Wuhan\\u2019s case, it seems very likely that the leap to human-to-human transmission, and the sudden explosion in numbers, was concealed by local authorities keen not to risk the local economy or to disturb the smooth progress of the \\u201ctwo sessions,\\u201d important mid-January political meetings. The number of cases stayed at 41 for weeks and then suddenly jumped to more than 200 after the virus reached other countries a week ago. Meanwhile, Wuhan officials were scheduling large-scale public events right up until the quarantine was imposed.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s less reason for the central government to squash the numbers, and the enormous leap from 41 to nearly 2,000 cases this week may be the result of the sudden interest by Beijing in the epidemic. But government officials are also in the routine\\u2014and hard-to-break\\u2014habit of concealing information from the public, especially negative information. Huge amounts of resources are put into controlling and suppressing information in China, and doctors, reporters, and ordinary people have already been threatened or arrested for posting independently about the outbreak. A sudden flood of online posts today praised the government and criticized people for posting unauthorized information.\\n\\nChinese media is enjoying a short burst of relative freedom, with Caixin and other outlets producing some excellent and critical reporting. But that\\u2019s common in the aftermath of disaster in China; the sudden impetus of the news creates several days of comparative openness before the propaganda authorities decide and enforce new lines. (I saw it happen after the Sichuan earthquake and again after the Tianjin explosions when I worked in Chinese newsrooms.). Papers are already being forced to issue apologies if their reporters speak out of line. The internet might well be cut at some point, as happened in Xinjiang in 2009 after the riots there.\\n\\nEven if the government doesn\\u2019t want to distort data, its ability to gather information is also limited. Diagnostic test kits are in short supply, the population potentially affected is huge, and many poorer Chinese\\u2014those most affected\\u2014are out of reach for the state.\\n\\nThe scientific community in China is genuinely extremely concerned and attempting to share information as rapidly and transparently as it can with foreign counterparts. But it is also working within an environment where everything, even scientific research, is politicized. Since the ascent of Chinese President Xi Jinping to dictatorial status, many scientific papers begin with routine encomiums to Xi Jinping Thought, for instance.\\n\\nI keep seeing all these videos of dead bodies and people flooding Wuhan hospitals. What\\u2019s up with that?\\n\\nSeveral videos have emerged from Wuhan showing disturbing scenes at hospitals, such as bodies abandoned in corridors. But this doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re victims of the virus\\u2014except indirectly. Wuhan has 11 million people: Using the average mortality rate for China, that means approximately 213 people die there daily, as in any large city. Add in that it\\u2019s winter, and it\\u2019s flu season, and the conventional rate of death is even higher. Some of the videos are also mislabeled, or fakes; there\\u2019s a useful list being maintained here.\\n\\nNow remember that Wuhan\\u2019s health care system is completely flooded right now. Everyone with a cold is heading to the hospital to get checked, and medical staff are exhausted and overwhelmed. 450 army medical staff have been sent to help, and two emergency field hospital using prefabricated materials are being erected, but that\\u2019s unlikely to be enough. Those corpses are very likely people who died of regular causes but who simply haven\\u2019t been processed as they would in calmer times. As anyone who has been through Chinese health care knows, hospitals there are often chaotic places where patients regularly find themselves sitting with IVs in corridors, on the floor, or even in the parking lot; add in epidemic and quarantine, and everything falls apart. The regular medical number\\u2014120\\u2014is producing no response most of the time.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s one scary possibility here, though. Hospitals themselves could be becoming vectors for the virus. They\\u2019re already known to have infected at least 14 health care workers, and there are reports of widespread infection among medical staff who are running out of masks and gloves. Add to that patients crowding to get help, and even those whose symptoms are the result of ordinary colds rather than the virus might end up walking away infected.\\n\\nInside the quarantine zone, perhaps. A tremendous amount of fear is emerging in the patchy picture we get through social media. But there are no accounts of riots or disturbances or of clashes with police or attempts to escape the quarantine zone. That\\u2019s hopefully a good sign.\\n\\nOutside of Wuhan, people seem worried but calm. This is where some of China\\u2019s advantages, such as extensive networks of block workers and community centers, can come into play in keeping people informed without panic. There are runs on masks and hand sanitizer, which you\\u2019d expect. The most disturbing aspect may be the measures taken by some villages and townships, which are posting their own blockades to keep travelers out. That could get quite nasty, as anyone who has passed through a village gate late at night\\u2014where locals sometimes set up informal tollbooths, enforced by thugs\\u2014knows.\\n\\nThe control on information is probably helping to reduce potential panic and unjustified rumor, even as it may also be concealing vital facts. Chinese-language chat groups and forums in the United States, which lack those controls, seem far more panicked than those inside China itself, with extreme concern being shown over, for instance, visiting school groups from Wuhan and people warning others to stockpile medical supplies from CVS.\\n\\nThere are also widespread rumors among the Uighur diaspora\\u2014the Turkic minority persecuted by China in the Western region of Xinjiang; they\\u2019re expressing both fears that the original virus might have been a byproduct of Chinese bio-experimentation on Uighurs and more grounded worries that if the virus reaches the detention camps in which over a million Uighurs are held, the results could be a devastating infection.\\n\\nWhat about the political fallout?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s still very early days, but heads will almost certainly roll over the initial delay or cover-up. The central government has already made ominous noises. Given the usual pattern, this may well involve suddenly discovering that the Wuhan mayor, or local party leaders, was corrupt all along.\\n\\nIf the outbreak can be controlled, then this may be spun as a success for the system and a justification of authoritarian powers. If it isn\\u2019t, it\\u2019s a genuinely serious threat\\u2014not to Communist Party rule itself but to Xi. He\\u2019s already facing private dissent from members of the political-economic elite who believe he has mishandled national affairs. The disruption of a full-scale epidemic would be a perfect opportunity for his opponents to reveal themselves and move against him.\\n\\nThe top levels of the propaganda media\\u2014People\\u2019s Daily and the Xinwen Lianbo news broadcast\\u2014were still heavily downplaying the story until late in the week. People\\u2019s Daily hasn\\u2019t yet mentioned it on the front pages, which have been devoted entirely to praise of Xi and national prosperity; the story was buried on Page 4 on Wednesday, while it took the nightly news 22 minutes to reach the story. On Saturday, however, the broadcast led with a seven-minute meeting of the Central Committee, showing Xi in a leadership role.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s a contrast with previous disasters under Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, where the media led with images of national leadership and personal appearances. Wen, in particular, became sardonically nicknamed \\u201cthe best actor\\u201d for his kind but stern appearances in disaster zones, ordering local officials around and representing the paternal control of the party. Neither Xi nor premier Li Keqiang has visited Wuhan or announced plans to do so.\\n\\nThat might be simply because it\\u2019s far more difficult to protect a leader from a virus than from fire or flood. But it might also be a real fear that the epidemic will run out of control\\u2014and thus a desire to disassociate themselves from it as much as possible.\", \"author\": \"James Palmer\", \"url\": \"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/25/how-to-tell-whats-really-happening-with-the-wuhan-virus/\", \"published\": \"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 23:48:31 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580014111, \"collection_utc\": 1580085147}",News,1580014111

The Protectionists Are Right And The Free Traders Are Wrong?\", \"content\": \"Submitted by Michael Every of Rabobank\\n\\nWhat if... the protectionists are right and the free traders are wrong?\\n\\n2020 starts with markets feeling optimistic due to a US-China trade deal and a reworked NAFTA in the form of the USMCA. However, the tide towards protectionism may still be coming in, not going out.\\n\\nThe intellectual appeal of the basis for free trade, Ricardo\\u2019s theory of comparative advantage, where Portugal specializes in wine, and the UK in cloth, is still clearly there. Moreover, trade has always been a beneficial and enriching part of human culture. Yet the fact is that for the majority of the last 5,000 years global trade has been highly-politicized and heavily-regulated. Indeed, global free-trade only began following the abolition of the UK Corn Laws in 1846, which reduced British agricultural tariffs, brought in European wheat and corn, and allowed the UK to maximize its comparative advantage in industry. Yet it took until 1860 for the UK to fully embrace free trade, and even then the unpalatable historical record is that during this \\u2018golden age\\u2019, the British:\\n\\nDestroyed the Indian textile industry to benefit their own cloth manufacturers;\\n\\u2022 Started the Opium Wars to balance UK-China trade by selling China addictive drugs;\\n\\u2022 Ignored the Irish Potato Famine and continued to allow Irish wheat exports;\\n\\u2022 Forced Siam (Thailand) to open up its economy to trade with gunboats (as the US did with Japan); and\\n\\u2022 Colonized much of Africa and Asia.\\n\\nAs we showed back in \\u2018Currency and Wars\\u2019, after an initial embrace of free trade, the major European powers and Japan saw that their relative comparative advantage meant they remained at the bottom of the development ladder as agricultural producers, an area where prices were also being depressed by huge US output; meanwhile, the UK sold industrial goods, ran a huge trade surplus, and ruled the waves militarily. This was politically unsustainable even though the UK vigorously backed the intellectual concept of free trade given it was such a winner from it.\\n\\nRegardless, the first flowering of free trade collapsed back into nationalism and protectionism - bloodily so in 1914. Free trade was tried again from 1919 - but burned-out even more bloodily in the 1930s and 1940s. After WW2, most developed countries had moderately free trade - but most developing countries did not. We only started to reembrace global free trade from the 1990s onwards when the Cold War ended \\u2013 and here it is under stress again. In short, only around 100 years in a total of 5,000 years of civilization has seen real global free trade, it has failed twice already, and it is once again coming under pressure.\\n\\nWhat are we getting wrong? Perhaps that Ricardo\\u2019s theory has major flaws that don\\u2019t get included in our textbooks, as summarized in this overlooked quote\\n\\n\\u201cIt would undoubtedly be advantageous to the capitalists of England\\u2026[that] the wine and cloth should both be made in Portugal [and that] the capital and labour of England employed in making cloth should be removed to Portugal for that purpose.\\u201d Which is pretty much what happens today! However, Ricardo adds that this won\\u2019t happen because \\u201cMost men of property [will be] satisfied with a low rate of profits in their own country, rather than seek a more advantageous employment for their wealth in foreign nations,\\u201d which is simply not true at all! In other words, his premise is flawed in that:\\n\\u2022 It is atemporal in assuming countries move to their comparative advantage painlessly and instantly;\\n\\u2022 It assumes full employment when if there is unemployment a country is better off producing at home to reduce it, regardless of higher cost;\\n\\u2022 It assumes capital between countries is immobile, i.e., investors don\\u2019t shift money and technology abroad. (Which Adam Smith\\u2019s \\u2018Wealth of Nations\\u2019, Book IV, Chapter II also assumes doesn\\u2019t happen, as an \\u201cinvisible hand\\u201d keeps money invested in one\\u2019s home country\\u2019s industry and not abroad: we don\\u2019t read him correctly either.);\\n\\u2022 It assumes trade balances under free trade - but since when has this been true? Rather we see large deficits and inverse capital flows, and so debts steadily increasing in deficit countries;\\n\\u2022 It assumes all goods are equal as in Ricardo\\u2019s example, cloth produced in the UK and wine produced in Portugal are equivalent. Yet some sectors provide well-paid and others badly-paid employment: why only produce the latter?\\n\\nAs Ricardo\\u2019s theory requires key conditions that are not met in reality most of the time, why are we surprised that most of reality fails to produce idealised free trade most of the time? Several past US presidents before Donald Trump made exactly that point. Munroe (1817-25) argued: \\u201cThe conditions necessary for Free Trade\\u2019s success - reciprocity and international peace - have never occurred and cannot be expected\\u201d. Grant (1869-77) noted \\u201cWithin 200 years, when America has gotten out of protection all that it can offer, it too will adopt free trade\\u201d.\\n\\nYet arguably we are better, not worse, off regardless of these sentiments \\u2013 so hooray! How so? Well, did you know that Adam Smith, who we equate with free markets, and who created the term \\u201cmercantile system\\u201d to describe the national-protectionist policies opposed to it, argued the US should remain an agricultural producer and buy its industrial goods from the UK? It was Founding Father Alexander Hamilton who rejected this approach, and his \\u201cinfant industry\\u201d policy of industrialization and infrastructure spending saw the US emerge as the world\\u2019s leading economy instead. That was the same development model that, with tweaks, was then adopted by pre-WW1 Japan, France, and Germany to successfully rival the UK; and then post-WW2 by Japan (again) and South Korea; and then more recently by China, that key global growth driver. Would we really be better off if the US was still mainly growing cotton and wheat, China rice and apples, and the UK was making most of the world\\u2019s consumer goods? Thank the lack of free trade if you think otherwise!\\n\\nYet look at the examples above and there is a further argument for more protectionism ahead. Ricardo assumes a benign global political environment for free trade. Yet what if the UK and Portugal are rivals or enemies? What if the choice is between steel and wine? You can\\u2019t invade neighbours armed with wine as you can with steel! A large part of the trade tension between China and the US, just as between pre-WW1 Germany and the UK, is not about trade per se: for both sides, it is about who produces key inputs with national security implications - and hence is about relative power. This is why we hear US hawks underlining that they don\\u2019t want to export their highest technology to China, or to specialize only in agricultural exports to it as China moves up the value-chain. It also helps underline why for most of the past 5,000 years trade has not been free. Indeed, this argument also holds true for the other claimed benefit of free trade: the cross-flow of ideas and technology. That is great for friends, but not for those less trusted.\\n\\nOf course, this doesn\\u2019t mean liked-minded groups of countries with similar-enough or sympathetic-enough economies and politics should avoid free trade: clearly for some states it can work out nicely - even if within the EU one could argue there are also underlying strains. However, it is a huge stretch to assume a one-size-fits-all free trade policy will always work best for all countries, as some would have it. That is a fairy tale. History shows it wasn\\u2019t the case; national security concerns show it can never always be the case; and Ricardo argues this logically won\\u2019t be the case.\\n\\nYet we need not despair. The track record also shows that global growth can continue even despite protectionism, and in some cases can benefit from it. That being said, should the US resort to more Hamiltonian policies versus everyone, not just China, then we are in for real financial market turbulence ahead given the role the US Dollar plays today compared to the role gold played for Smith and Ricardo!

Yet it took until 1860 for the UK to fully embrace free trade, and even then the unpalatable historical record is that during this \\u2018golden age\\u2019, the British:\\n\\nDestroyed the Indian textile industry to benefit their own cloth manufacturers;\\n\\u2022 Started the Opium Wars to balance UK-China trade by selling China addictive drugs;\\n\\u2022 Ignored the Irish Potato Famine and continued to allow Irish wheat exports;\\n\\u2022 Forced Siam (Thailand) to open up its economy to trade with gunboats (as the US did with Japan); and\\n\\u2022 Colonized much of Africa and Asia.\\n\\nAs we showed back in \\u2018Currency and Wars\\u2019, after an initial embrace of free trade, the major European powers and Japan saw that their relative comparative advantage meant they remained at the bottom of the development ladder as agricultural producers, an area where prices were also being depressed by huge US output; meanwhile, the UK sold industrial goods, ran a huge trade surplus, and ruled the waves militarily. This was politically unsustainable even though the UK vigorously backed the intellectual concept of free trade given it was such a winner from it.\\n\\nRegardless, the first flowering of free trade collapsed back into nationalism and protectionism - bloodily so in 1914. Free trade was tried again from 1919 - but burned-out even more bloodily in the 1930s and 1940s. After WW2, most developed countries had moderately free trade - but most developing countries did not. We only started to reembrace global free trade from the 1990s onwards when the Cold War ended \\u2013 and here it is under stress again. In short, only around 100 years in a total of 5,000 years of civilization has seen real global free trade, it has failed twice already, and it is once again coming under pressure.\\n\\nWhat are we getting wrong? Perhaps that Ricardo\\u2019s theory has major flaws that don\\u2019t get included in our textbooks, as summarized in this overlooked quote\\n\\n\\u201cIt would undoubtedly be advantageous to the capitalists of England\\u2026[that] the wine and cloth should both be made in Portugal [and that] the capital and labour of England employed in making cloth should be removed to Portugal for that purpose.\\u201d Which is pretty much what happens today! However, Ricardo adds that this won\\u2019t happen because \\u201cMost men of property [will be] satisfied with a low rate of profits in their own country, rather than seek a more advantageous employment for their wealth in foreign nations,\\u201d which is simply not true at all! In other words, his premise is flawed in that:\\n\\u2022 It is atemporal in assuming countries move to their comparative advantage painlessly and instantly;\\n\\u2022 It assumes full employment when if there is unemployment a country is better off producing at home to reduce it, regardless of higher cost;\\n\\u2022 It assumes capital between countries is immobile, i.e., investors don\\u2019t shift money and technology abroad. (Which Adam Smith\\u2019s \\u2018Wealth of Nations\\u2019, Book IV, Chapter II also assumes doesn\\u2019t happen, as an \\u201cinvisible hand\\u201d keeps money invested in one\\u2019s home country\\u2019s industry and not abroad: we don\\u2019t read him correctly either.);\\n\\u2022 It assumes trade balances under free trade - but since when has this been true? Rather we see large deficits and inverse capital flows, and so debts steadily increasing in deficit countries;\\n\\u2022 It assumes all goods are equal as in Ricardo\\u2019s example, cloth produced in the UK and wine produced in Portugal are equivalent. Yet some sectors provide well-paid and others badly-paid employment: why only produce the latter?\\n\\nAs Ricardo\\u2019s theory requires key conditions that are not met in reality most of the time, why are we surprised that most of reality fails to produce idealised free trade most of the time? Several past US presidents before Donald Trump made exactly that point. Munroe (1817-25) argued: \\u201cThe conditions necessary for Free Trade\\u2019s success - reciprocity and international peace - have never occurred and cannot be expected\\u201d. Grant (1869-77) noted \\u201cWithin 200 years, when America has gotten out of protection all that it can offer, it too will adopt free trade\\u201d.\\n\\nYet arguably we are better, not worse, off regardless of these sentiments \\u2013 so hooray! How so? Well, did you know that Adam Smith, who we equate with free markets, and who created the term \\u201cmercantile system\\u201d to describe the national-protectionist policies opposed to it, argued the US should remain an agricultural producer and buy its industrial goods from the UK? It was Founding Father Alexander Hamilton who rejected this approach, and his \\u201cinfant industry\\u201d policy of industrialization and infrastructure spending saw the US emerge as the world\\u2019s leading economy instead. That was the same development model that, with tweaks, was then adopted by pre-WW1 Japan, France, and Germany to successfully rival the UK; and then post-WW2 by Japan (again) and South Korea; and then more recently by China, that key global growth driver. Would we really be better off if the US was still mainly growing cotton and wheat, China rice and apples, and the UK was making most of the world\\u2019s consumer goods? Thank the lack of free trade if you think otherwise!\\n\\nYet look at the examples above and there is a further argument for more protectionism ahead. Ricardo assumes a benign global political environment for free trade. Yet what if the UK and Portugal are rivals or enemies? What if the choice is between steel and wine? You can\\u2019t invade neighbours armed with wine as you can with steel! A large part of the trade tension between China and the US, just as between pre-WW1 Germany and the UK, is not about trade per se: for both sides, it is about who produces key inputs with national security implications - and hence is about relative power. This is why we hear US hawks underlining that they don\\u2019t want to export their highest technology to China, or to specialize only in agricultural exports to it as China moves up the value-chain. It also helps underline why for most of the past 5,000 years trade has not been free. Indeed, this argument also holds true for the other claimed benefit of free trade: the cross-flow of ideas and technology. That is great for friends, but not for those less trusted.\\n\\nOf course, this doesn\\u2019t mean liked-minded groups of countries with similar-enough or sympathetic-enough economies and politics should avoid free trade: clearly for some states it can work out nicely - even if within the EU one could argue there are also underlying strains. However, it is a huge stretch to assume a one-size-fits-all free trade policy will always work best for all countries, as some would have it. That is a fairy tale. History shows it wasn\\u2019t the case; national security concerns show it can never always be the case; and Ricardo argues this logically won\\u2019t be the case.\\n\\nYet we need not despair. The track record also shows that global growth can continue even despite protectionism, and in some cases can benefit from it. That being said, should the US resort to more Hamiltonian policies versus everyone, not just China, then we are in for real financial market turbulence ahead given the role the US Dollar plays today compared to the role gold played for Smith and Ricardo!

Moreover, trade has always been a beneficial and enriching part of human culture. Yet the fact is that for the majority of the last 5,000 years global trade has been highly-politicized and heavily-regulated. Indeed, global free-trade only began following the abolition of the UK Corn Laws in 1846, which reduced British agricultural tariffs, brought in European wheat and corn, and allowed the UK to maximize its comparative advantage in industry. Yet it took until 1860 for the UK to fully embrace free trade, and even then the unpalatable historical record is that during this \\u2018golden age\\u2019, the British:\\n\\nDestroyed the Indian textile industry to benefit their own cloth manufacturers;\\n\\u2022 Started the Opium Wars to balance UK-China trade by selling China addictive drugs;\\n\\u2022 Ignored the Irish Potato Famine and continued to allow Irish wheat exports;\\n\\u2022 Forced Siam (Thailand) to open up its economy to trade with gunboats (as the US did with Japan); and\\n\\u2022 Colonized much of Africa and Asia.\\n\\nAs we showed back in \\u2018Currency and Wars\\u2019, after an initial embrace of free trade, the major European powers and Japan saw that their relative comparative advantage meant they remained at the bottom of the development ladder as agricultural producers, an area where prices were also being depressed by huge US output; meanwhile, the UK sold industrial goods, ran a huge trade surplus, and ruled the waves militarily. This was politically unsustainable even though the UK vigorously backed the intellectual concept of free trade given it was such a winner from it.\\n\\nRegardless, the first flowering of free trade collapsed back into nationalism and protectionism - bloodily so in 1914. Free trade was tried again from 1919 - but burned-out even more bloodily in the 1930s and 1940s. After WW2, most developed countries had moderately free trade - but most developing countries did not.

That is great for friends, but not for those less trusted.\\n\\nOf course, this doesn\\u2019t mean liked-minded groups of countries with similar-enough or sympathetic-enough economies and politics should avoid free trade: clearly for some states it can work out nicely - even if within the EU one could argue there are also underlying strains. However, it is a huge stretch to assume a one-size-fits-all free trade policy will always work best for all countries, as some would have it. That is a fairy tale. History shows it wasn\\u2019t the case; national security concerns show it can never always be the case; and Ricardo argues this logically won\\u2019t be the case.\\n\\nYet we need not despair. The track record also shows that global growth can continue even despite protectionism, and in some cases can benefit from it. That being said, should the US resort to more Hamiltonian policies versus everyone, not just China, then we are in for real financial market turbulence ahead given the role the US Dollar plays today compared to the role gold played for Smith and Ricardo!

The USSR\\u2019s tried to answer through raw weight, both in terms of size and number of boats.\\n\\nHistory\\u2019s three great submarine campaigns include the First Battle of the Atlantic, the Second Battle of the Atlantic, and the US Navy\\u2019s (USN) war against Japanese commerce in World War II. The contestants fought these campaigns through asymmetrical means, with submarines doing battle against aircraft and surface escorts.\\n\\nBut the greatest true submarine campaign never (or only intermittently) went \\u201chot.\\u201d Waged with advanced, streamlined submarines, hunting each other from the polar ice cap to the Eastern seaboard, the Cold War undersea \\u201cgame\\u201d lasted for over three decades. In case of real war, these submarines would safeguard (or destroy) NATO\\u2019s trans-Atlantic lifeline, and would protect (or sink) much of the nuclear deterrent of America, Russia, Britain, and France.\\n\\nSo what were the best submarines of the Cold War era? For the purposes of this list, we\\u2019re excluding ballistic missiles submarines or boomers, which have an entirely different mission from attack boats, built for different requirements. Instead, this list will focus on submarines optimized for killing surface ships or other submarines. The criteria should be familiar from previous lists; to what extent did the vessels perform its strategic mission at a price that its nation could afford?\\n\\nCost: Submarines compete with other providers of national security. If they break the bank, they risk crowding out the other capabilities that a nation requires for its defense.\\n\\nReliability: When submarines have accidents, the results can be catastrophic. And showing up is half the battle; boats stuck in port can\\u2019t fulfill national objectives.\\n\\nEffectiveness: Could the submarine do the job? How did it stack up against its contemporaries?\\n\\nLarge, fast, and quiet, the Permit class set that standard for American and British submarines for the rest of the Cold War. Developed with a series of innovations that set them apart from their predecessors, the Skipjack class, the Permits immediately became state of the undersea art. These innovations included powerful bow sonar, a streamlined, deep-dive capable hull, and advanced quieting technology. Among the first submarines conceived an optimized for an anti-submarine mission, the Permits could threaten not only the Soviet deterrent, but also the Russian capacity for disrupting the trans-Atlantic lifeline.\\n\\nThe first of fourteen Permits entered service in 1961, the last in 1968. Most of the boats served through the end of the Cold War. Displacing 4200 tons, the Permits could make 28 knots, and could fire both advanced torpedoes and Harpoon anti-ship missiles.\\n\\nThe lead ship of the Permit class was Thresher, commissioned in 1961. On April 10, 1963, she was lost with all hands while conducting a diving test. The tragic loss of Thresher, which imploded after a still-disputed systems failure, overshadowed the long careers of the rest of the class. However, that loss was critical to developing the safety standards that would prevent future accidents. The loss of Thresher, in a very important sense, led to the long history of safety success in the USN\\u2019s submarine fleet.\\n\\nThe United States and the Soviet Union were the main players in the Cold War submarine campaign, but were hardly the only entrants. The Royal Navy, initially with some US assistance, developed a series of lethal nuclear submarine designs, eventually making a more than creditable contribution to NATO\\u2019s undersea posture. One submarine, HMS Conqueror, remains the only nuclear submarine to have destroyed an enemy ship in anger.\\n\\nFollowing up on the Churchill class, the Swiftsures were of innovative design, both in terms of hull technology and propulsion. They were the first full class of submarines to employ pump jet technology, which made propulsion more efficient while reducing noise. The enlarged but simplified hull redistributed machinery allowed a much deeper diving depth than previous Royal Navy subs.\\n\\nDisplacing 5000 tons submerged, the Swiftsures could make some 30 knots submerged. They carried standard torpedoes, as well as Harpoon and (in some boats) Tomahawk cruise missiles. The six Swiftsures entered service between 1973 and 1981, with the last decommissioning in 2010.\\n\\nThe Swiftsures had their problems, including a series of bizarre accidental collisions, some structural failures, and some minor reactor troubles. Nevertheless, they served the Royal Navy very effectively against the Soviets, and would have won victories in the Falklands if the politics had played out differently.\\n\\nNot every navy can afford an advanced nuclear attack submarine. Nevertheless, submarines solve strategic problems, and not every great submarine needs to be a Porsche. The German Type 209, first built in 1971, served as the strategic answer for a great many navies in the Cold War, and continues to serve today.\\n\\nFor obvious reasons, German submarine development stalled at the end of World War II. Although the Type XXI set the standard for post-war boats, legal restrictions prevented both East and West Germany from building any submarines in the first decade of the Cold War. After a series of designs that ran from non-to-moderately successful, HDW developed the Type 209 class for export.\\n\\nA diesel-electric, the Type 209 displaces between 1200 and 1800 tons (depending on variant), and can make 23 knots submerged. It can launch both torpedoes and anti-ship weapons, such as the Harpoon. The basic hull design has proven remarkably flexible, spawning a series of variants specialized for different tasks. The Type 209 gives small navies a viable anti-submarine option, as well as the capacity to threaten the surface forces of much larger, more powerful fleets.\\n\\nSince 1971, 61 Type 209s have entered service with thirteen navies. 59 of those boats remain in service, with two more scheduled for delivery to Egypt in 2016. The ability of the Type 209 to remain in service in so many different fleets, often in widely varying maintenance conditions, attests to the robust nature of the initial design.\\n\\nThe Oscars were the apogee of the Soviet cruise missile submarine, a type that began with the Echo and continued with the Charlie. The first Oscars entered service in 1981,and immediately presented a serious challenge for Western naval planners. Designed specifically for anti-shipping attacks, these subs could strike NATO carrier groups with P-700 Granit missiles from a range of up to 300 miles. This widened the area that American anti-submarine vessels needed to patrol, and meant that attacks could come from unexpected vectors. Equipped with a conventional warhead, the Granit could easily cause a mission kill. With a nuclear warhead, it could give a carrier battle group a very bad day.\\n\\nAnd the Oscars were huge. Displacing 16500 tons, they could make 32 knots submerged. They carried 24 Granit missiles, in addition to a bevy of torpedo launched weapons.\\n\\nThe United States and the United Kingdom would eventually adopt the same practice as the Russians, although instead of dedicating specific sub types to cruise missile launches they would focus on converting missiles for launch from conventionally designed nuclear attack subs. Later boats in the Los Angeles class would carry dedicated cruise missile silos, technically making them SSGNs instead of SSNs, although the designation never changed in practice (until the conversion of four Ohio class boomers to the cruise missile mission). The real utility of cruise missiles has been land attack rather than naval attack, as cruise missiles launched from US subs have proven quite effective in several recent conflicts.\\n\\nThe Soviets completed only five Oscars before the end of the Cold War, and another eight after. One, the Kursk, was lost in one of the most horrific accidents in submarine history. Several others, however, remain in service with the Russian Navy.\\n\\nThe United States enjoyed technology and designs advantages for most of the Cold War that allowed its submarines to operate much more quietly than their Soviet counterparts. US technological innovation and industrial practice made it possible for the USN to develop and maintain submarines with advanced noise-suppression technology. The USSR\\u2019s tried to answer through raw weight, both in terms of size and number of boats.\\n\\nSoviet espionage also tried to even the score. The fruits of the Walker spy ring and the Toshiba-Konigsberg scandal spread across several classes of Soviet submarine, but the Akulas benefitted most of all. The Akula\\u2019s were the first Soviet submarines to compete with American submarines on noise, reportedly matching the Los Angeles class at most speeds. Displacing 8000 tons, the Akulas could both outrun and outgun the American Los Angeles class, making up to 35 knots and carrying a larger array of torpedoes and cruise missiles.\\n\\nSteel hulled (unlike their Sierra and Alfa predecessors), the Akulas also achieved cost-savings while improving mission capability, a rare feat for a modern weapon system.

If they break the bank, they risk crowding out the other capabilities that a nation requires for its defense.\\n\\nReliability: When submarines have accidents, the results can be catastrophic. And showing up is half the battle; boats stuck in port can\\u2019t fulfill national objectives.\\n\\nEffectiveness: Could the submarine do the job? How did it stack up against its contemporaries?\\n\\nLarge, fast, and quiet, the Permit class set that standard for American and British submarines for the rest of the Cold War. Developed with a series of innovations that set them apart from their predecessors, the Skipjack class, the Permits immediately became state of the undersea art. These innovations included powerful bow sonar, a streamlined, deep-dive capable hull, and advanced quieting technology. Among the first submarines conceived an optimized for an anti-submarine mission, the Permits could threaten not only the Soviet deterrent, but also the Russian capacity for disrupting the trans-Atlantic lifeline.\\n\\nThe first of fourteen Permits entered service in 1961, the last in 1968. Most of the boats served through the end of the Cold War. Displacing 4200 tons, the Permits could make 28 knots, and could fire both advanced torpedoes and Harpoon anti-ship missiles.\\n\\nThe lead ship of the Permit class was Thresher, commissioned in 1961. On April 10, 1963, she was lost with all hands while conducting a diving test. The tragic loss of Thresher, which imploded after a still-disputed systems failure, overshadowed the long careers of the rest of the class. However, that loss was critical to developing the safety standards that would prevent future accidents. The loss of Thresher, in a very important sense, led to the long history of safety success in the USN\\u2019s submarine fleet.\\n\\nThe United States and the Soviet Union were the main players in the Cold War submarine campaign, but were hardly the only entrants. The Royal Navy, initially with some US assistance, developed a series of lethal nuclear submarine designs, eventually making a more than creditable contribution to NATO\\u2019s undersea posture. One submarine, HMS Conqueror, remains the only nuclear submarine to have destroyed an enemy ship in anger.\\n\\nFollowing up on the Churchill class, the Swiftsures were of innovative design, both in terms of hull technology and propulsion. They were the first full class of submarines to employ pump jet technology, which made propulsion more efficient while reducing noise. The enlarged but simplified hull redistributed machinery allowed a much deeper diving depth than previous Royal Navy subs.\\n\\nDisplacing 5000 tons submerged, the Swiftsures could make some 30 knots submerged. They carried standard torpedoes, as well as Harpoon and (in some boats) Tomahawk cruise missiles. The six Swiftsures entered service between 1973 and 1981, with the last decommissioning in 2010.\\n\\nThe Swiftsures had their problems, including a series of bizarre accidental collisions, some structural failures, and some minor reactor troubles. Nevertheless, they served the Royal Navy very effectively against the Soviets, and would have won victories in the Falklands if the politics had played out differently.\\n\\nNot every navy can afford an advanced nuclear attack submarine. Nevertheless, submarines solve strategic problems, and not every great submarine needs to be a Porsche. The German Type 209, first built in 1971, served as the strategic answer for a great many navies in the Cold War, and continues to serve today.\\n\\nFor obvious reasons, German submarine development stalled at the end of World War II. Although the Type XXI set the standard for post-war boats, legal restrictions prevented both East and West Germany from building any submarines in the first decade of the Cold War. After a series of designs that ran from non-to-moderately successful, HDW developed the Type 209 class for export.\\n\\nA diesel-electric, the Type 209 displaces between 1200 and 1800 tons (depending on variant), and can make 23 knots submerged. It can launch both torpedoes and anti-ship weapons, such as the Harpoon. The basic hull design has proven remarkably flexible, spawning a series of variants specialized for different tasks. The Type 209 gives small navies a viable anti-submarine option, as well as the capacity to threaten the surface forces of much larger, more powerful fleets.\\n\\nSince 1971, 61 Type 209s have entered service with thirteen navies. 59 of those boats remain in service, with two more scheduled for delivery to Egypt in 2016. The ability of the Type 209 to remain in service in so many different fleets, often in widely varying maintenance conditions, attests to the robust nature of the initial design.\\n\\nThe Oscars were the apogee of the Soviet cruise missile submarine, a type that began with the Echo and continued with the Charlie. The first Oscars entered service in 1981,and immediately presented a serious challenge for Western naval planners. Designed specifically for anti-shipping attacks, these subs could strike NATO carrier groups with P-700 Granit missiles from a range of up to 300 miles. This widened the area that American anti-submarine vessels needed to patrol, and meant that attacks could come from unexpected vectors. Equipped with a conventional warhead, the Granit could easily cause a mission kill. With a nuclear warhead, it could give a carrier battle group a very bad day.\\n\\nAnd the Oscars were huge. Displacing 16500 tons, they could make 32 knots submerged. They carried 24 Granit missiles, in addition to a bevy of torpedo launched weapons.\\n\\nThe United States and the United Kingdom would eventually adopt the same practice as the Russians, although instead of dedicating specific sub types to cruise missile launches they would focus on converting missiles for launch from conventionally designed nuclear attack subs. Later boats in the Los Angeles class would carry dedicated cruise missile silos, technically making them SSGNs instead of SSNs, although the designation never changed in practice (until the conversion of four Ohio class boomers to the cruise missile mission). The real utility of cruise missiles has been land attack rather than naval attack, as cruise missiles launched from US subs have proven quite effective in several recent conflicts.\\n\\nThe Soviets completed only five Oscars before the end of the Cold War, and another eight after. One, the Kursk, was lost in one of the most horrific accidents in submarine history. Several others, however, remain in service with the Russian Navy.\\n\\nThe United States enjoyed technology and designs advantages for most of the Cold War that allowed its submarines to operate much more quietly than their Soviet counterparts. US technological innovation and industrial practice made it possible for the USN to develop and maintain submarines with advanced noise-suppression technology. The USSR\\u2019s tried to answer through raw weight, both in terms of size and number of boats.\\n\\nSoviet espionage also tried to even the score. The fruits of the Walker spy ring and the Toshiba-Konigsberg scandal spread across several classes of Soviet submarine, but the Akulas benefitted most of all. The Akula\\u2019s were the first Soviet submarines to compete with American submarines on noise, reportedly matching the Los Angeles class at most speeds. Displacing 8000 tons, the Akulas could both outrun and outgun the American Los Angeles class, making up to 35 knots and carrying a larger array of torpedoes and cruise missiles.\\n\\nSteel hulled (unlike their Sierra and Alfa predecessors), the Akulas also achieved cost-savings while improving mission capability, a rare feat for a modern weapon system. Five Akulas entered service before the Cold War ended, with a total of fifteen eventually entering service. Nine remain in Russian service, with another on loan to the Indian Navy.\", \"author\": \"Robert Farley\", \"url\": \"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/death-deep-five-best-cold-war-submarines-116941\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 00:00 EST\", \"published_utc\": 1580014800, \"collection_utc\": 1580042634}",News,1580014800

It can launch both torpedoes and anti-ship weapons, such as the Harpoon. The basic hull design has proven remarkably flexible, spawning a series of variants specialized for different tasks. The Type 209 gives small navies a viable anti-submarine option, as well as the capacity to threaten the surface forces of much larger, more powerful fleets.\\n\\nSince 1971, 61 Type 209s have entered service with thirteen navies. 59 of those boats remain in service, with two more scheduled for delivery to Egypt in 2016. The ability of the Type 209 to remain in service in so many different fleets, often in widely varying maintenance conditions, attests to the robust nature of the initial design.\\n\\nThe Oscars were the apogee of the Soviet cruise missile submarine, a type that began with the Echo and continued with the Charlie. The first Oscars entered service in 1981,and immediately presented a serious challenge for Western naval planners. Designed specifically for anti-shipping attacks, these subs could strike NATO carrier groups with P-700 Granit missiles from a range of up to 300 miles. This widened the area that American anti-submarine vessels needed to patrol, and meant that attacks could come from unexpected vectors. Equipped with a conventional warhead, the Granit could easily cause a mission kill. With a nuclear warhead, it could give a carrier battle group a very bad day.\\n\\nAnd the Oscars were huge. Displacing 16500 tons, they could make 32 knots submerged. They carried 24 Granit missiles, in addition to a bevy of torpedo launched weapons.\\n\\nThe United States and the United Kingdom would eventually adopt the same practice as the Russians, although instead of dedicating specific sub types to cruise missile launches they would focus on converting missiles for launch from conventionally designed nuclear attack subs. Later boats in the Los Angeles class would carry dedicated cruise missile silos, technically making them SSGNs instead of SSNs, although the designation never changed in practice (until the conversion of four Ohio class boomers to the cruise missile mission). The real utility of cruise missiles has been land attack rather than naval attack, as cruise missiles launched from US subs have proven quite effective in several recent conflicts.\\n\\nThe Soviets completed only five Oscars before the end of the Cold War, and another eight after. One, the Kursk, was lost in one of the most horrific accidents in submarine history. Several others, however, remain in service with the Russian Navy.\\n\\nThe United States enjoyed technology and designs advantages for most of the Cold War that allowed its submarines to operate much more quietly than their Soviet counterparts.

The contestants fought these campaigns through asymmetrical means, with submarines doing battle against aircraft and surface escorts.\\n\\nBut the greatest true submarine campaign never (or only intermittently) went \\u201chot.\\u201d Waged with advanced, streamlined submarines, hunting each other from the polar ice cap to the Eastern seaboard, the Cold War undersea \\u201cgame\\u201d lasted for over three decades. In case of real war, these submarines would safeguard (or destroy) NATO\\u2019s trans-Atlantic lifeline, and would protect (or sink) much of the nuclear deterrent of America, Russia, Britain, and France.\\n\\nSo what were the best submarines of the Cold War era? For the purposes of this list, we\\u2019re excluding ballistic missiles submarines or boomers, which have an entirely different mission from attack boats, built for different requirements. Instead, this list will focus on submarines optimized for killing surface ships or other submarines. The criteria should be familiar from previous lists; to what extent did the vessels perform its strategic mission at a price that its nation could afford?\\n\\nCost: Submarines compete with other providers of national security. If they break the bank, they risk crowding out the other capabilities that a nation requires for its defense.\\n\\nReliability: When submarines have accidents, the results can be catastrophic. And showing up is half the battle; boats stuck in port can\\u2019t fulfill national objectives.\\n\\nEffectiveness: Could the submarine do the job? How did it stack up against its contemporaries?\\n\\nLarge, fast, and quiet, the Permit class set that standard for American and British submarines for the rest of the Cold War. Developed with a series of innovations that set them apart from their predecessors, the Skipjack class, the Permits immediately became state of the undersea art. These innovations included powerful bow sonar, a streamlined, deep-dive capable hull, and advanced quieting technology. Among the first submarines conceived an optimized for an anti-submarine mission, the Permits could threaten not only the Soviet deterrent, but also the Russian capacity for disrupting the trans-Atlantic lifeline.\\n\\nThe first of fourteen Permits entered service in 1961, the last in 1968. Most of the boats served through the end of the Cold War. Displacing 4200 tons, the Permits could make 28 knots, and could fire both advanced torpedoes and Harpoon anti-ship missiles.\\n\\nThe lead ship of the Permit class was Thresher, commissioned in 1961. On April 10, 1963, she was lost with all hands while conducting a diving test. The tragic loss of Thresher, which imploded after a still-disputed systems failure, overshadowed the long careers of the rest of the class. However, that loss was critical to developing the safety standards that would prevent future accidents. The loss of Thresher, in a very important sense, led to the long history of safety success in the USN\\u2019s submarine fleet.\\n\\nThe United States and the Soviet Union were the main players in the Cold War submarine campaign, but were hardly the only entrants. The Royal Navy, initially with some US assistance, developed a series of lethal nuclear submarine designs, eventually making a more than creditable contribution to NATO\\u2019s undersea posture. One submarine, HMS Conqueror, remains the only nuclear submarine to have destroyed an enemy ship in anger.\\n\\nFollowing up on the Churchill class, the Swiftsures were of innovative design, both in terms of hull technology and propulsion. They were the first full class of submarines to employ pump jet technology, which made propulsion more efficient while reducing noise. The enlarged but simplified hull redistributed machinery allowed a much deeper diving depth than previous Royal Navy subs.\\n\\nDisplacing 5000 tons submerged, the Swiftsures could make some 30 knots submerged. They carried standard torpedoes, as well as Harpoon and (in some boats) Tomahawk cruise missiles. The six Swiftsures entered service between 1973 and 1981, with the last decommissioning in 2010.\\n\\nThe Swiftsures had their problems, including a series of bizarre accidental collisions, some structural failures, and some minor reactor troubles. Nevertheless, they served the Royal Navy very effectively against the Soviets, and would have won victories in the Falklands if the politics had played out differently.\\n\\nNot every navy can afford an advanced nuclear attack submarine. Nevertheless, submarines solve strategic problems, and not every great submarine needs to be a Porsche. The German Type 209, first built in 1971, served as the strategic answer for a great many navies in the Cold War, and continues to serve today.\\n\\nFor obvious reasons, German submarine development stalled at the end of World War II.

The USSR\\u2019s tried to answer through raw weight, both in terms of size and number of boats.\\n\\nHistory\\u2019s three great submarine campaigns include the First Battle of the Atlantic, the Second Battle of the Atlantic, and the US Navy\\u2019s (USN) war against Japanese commerce in World War II. The contestants fought these campaigns through asymmetrical means, with submarines doing battle against aircraft and surface escorts.\\n\\nBut the greatest true submarine campaign never (or only intermittently) went \\u201chot.\\u201d Waged with advanced, streamlined submarines, hunting each other from the polar ice cap to the Eastern seaboard, the Cold War undersea \\u201cgame\\u201d lasted for over three decades. In case of real war, these submarines would safeguard (or destroy) NATO\\u2019s trans-Atlantic lifeline, and would protect (or sink) much of the nuclear deterrent of America, Russia, Britain, and France.\\n\\nSo what were the best submarines of the Cold War era? For the purposes of this list, we\\u2019re excluding ballistic missiles submarines or boomers, which have an entirely different mission from attack boats, built for different requirements. Instead, this list will focus on submarines optimized for killing surface ships or other submarines. The criteria should be familiar from previous lists; to what extent did the vessels perform its strategic mission at a price that its nation could afford?\\n\\nCost: Submarines compete with other providers of national security. If they break the bank, they risk crowding out the other capabilities that a nation requires for its defense.\\n\\nReliability: When submarines have accidents, the results can be catastrophic. And showing up is half the battle; boats stuck in port can\\u2019t fulfill national objectives.\\n\\nEffectiveness: Could the submarine do the job? How did it stack up against its contemporaries?\\n\\nLarge, fast, and quiet, the Permit class set that standard for American and British submarines for the rest of the Cold War. Developed with a series of innovations that set them apart from their predecessors, the Skipjack class, the Permits immediately became state of the undersea art. These innovations included powerful bow sonar, a streamlined, deep-dive capable hull, and advanced quieting technology. Among the first submarines conceived an optimized for an anti-submarine mission, the Permits could threaten not only the Soviet deterrent, but also the Russian capacity for disrupting the trans-Atlantic lifeline.\\n\\nThe first of fourteen Permits entered service in 1961, the last in 1968. Most of the boats served through the end of the Cold War. Displacing 4200 tons, the Permits could make 28 knots, and could fire both advanced torpedoes and Harpoon anti-ship missiles.\\n\\nThe lead ship of the Permit class was Thresher, commissioned in 1961. On April 10, 1963, she was lost with all hands while conducting a diving test. The tragic loss of Thresher, which imploded after a still-disputed systems failure, overshadowed the long careers of the rest of the class. However, that loss was critical to developing the safety standards that would prevent future accidents. The loss of Thresher, in a very important sense, led to the long history of safety success in the USN\\u2019s submarine fleet.\\n\\nThe United States and the Soviet Union were the main players in the Cold War submarine campaign, but were hardly the only entrants. The Royal Navy, initially with some US assistance, developed a series of lethal nuclear submarine designs, eventually making a more than creditable contribution to NATO\\u2019s undersea posture. One submarine, HMS Conqueror, remains the only nuclear submarine to have destroyed an enemy ship in anger.\\n\\nFollowing up on the Churchill class, the Swiftsures were of innovative design, both in terms of hull technology and propulsion. They were the first full class of submarines to employ pump jet technology, which made propulsion more efficient while reducing noise. The enlarged but simplified hull redistributed machinery allowed a much deeper diving depth than previous Royal Navy subs.\\n\\nDisplacing 5000 tons submerged, the Swiftsures could make some 30 knots submerged. They carried standard torpedoes, as well as Harpoon and (in some boats) Tomahawk cruise missiles. The six Swiftsures entered service between 1973 and 1981, with the last decommissioning in 2010.\\n\\nThe Swiftsures had their problems, including a series of bizarre accidental collisions, some structural failures, and some minor reactor troubles. Nevertheless, they served the Royal Navy very effectively against the Soviets, and would have won victories in the Falklands if the politics had played out differently.\\n\\nNot every navy can afford an advanced nuclear attack submarine. Nevertheless, submarines solve strategic problems, and not every great submarine needs to be a Porsche. The German Type 209, first built in 1971, served as the strategic answer for a great many navies in the Cold War, and continues to serve today.\\n\\nFor obvious reasons, German submarine development stalled at the end of World War II. Although the Type XXI set the standard for post-war boats, legal restrictions prevented both East and West Germany from building any submarines in the first decade of the Cold War. After a series of designs that ran from non-to-moderately successful, HDW developed the Type 209 class for export.\\n\\nA diesel-electric, the Type 209 displaces between 1200 and 1800 tons (depending on variant), and can make 23 knots submerged. It can launch both torpedoes and anti-ship weapons, such as the Harpoon. The basic hull design has proven remarkably flexible, spawning a series of variants specialized for different tasks. The Type 209 gives small navies a viable anti-submarine option, as well as the capacity to threaten the surface forces of much larger, more powerful fleets.\\n\\nSince 1971, 61 Type 209s have entered service with thirteen navies. 59 of those boats remain in service, with two more scheduled for delivery to Egypt in 2016. The ability of the Type 209 to remain in service in so many different fleets, often in widely varying maintenance conditions, attests to the robust nature of the initial design.\\n\\nThe Oscars were the apogee of the Soviet cruise missile submarine, a type that began with the Echo and continued with the Charlie. The first Oscars entered service in 1981,and immediately presented a serious challenge for Western naval planners. Designed specifically for anti-shipping attacks, these subs could strike NATO carrier groups with P-700 Granit missiles from a range of up to 300 miles. This widened the area that American anti-submarine vessels needed to patrol, and meant that attacks could come from unexpected vectors. Equipped with a conventional warhead, the Granit could easily cause a mission kill. With a nuclear warhead, it could give a carrier battle group a very bad day.\\n\\nAnd the Oscars were huge. Displacing 16500 tons, they could make 32 knots submerged. They carried 24 Granit missiles, in addition to a bevy of torpedo launched weapons.\\n\\nThe United States and the United Kingdom would eventually adopt the same practice as the Russians, although instead of dedicating specific sub types to cruise missile launches they would focus on converting missiles for launch from conventionally designed nuclear attack subs. Later boats in the Los Angeles class would carry dedicated cruise missile silos, technically making them SSGNs instead of SSNs, although the designation never changed in practice (until the conversion of four Ohio class boomers to the cruise missile mission). The real utility of cruise missiles has been land attack rather than naval attack, as cruise missiles launched from US subs have proven quite effective in several recent conflicts.\\n\\nThe Soviets completed only five Oscars before the end of the Cold War, and another eight after. One, the Kursk, was lost in one of the most horrific accidents in submarine history. Several others, however, remain in service with the Russian Navy.\\n\\nThe United States enjoyed technology and designs advantages for most of the Cold War that allowed its submarines to operate much more quietly than their Soviet counterparts. US technological innovation and industrial practice made it possible for the USN to develop and maintain submarines with advanced noise-suppression technology. The USSR\\u2019s tried to answer through raw weight, both in terms of size and number of boats.\\n\\nSoviet espionage also tried to even the score. The fruits of the Walker spy ring and the Toshiba-Konigsberg scandal spread across several classes of Soviet submarine, but the Akulas benefitted most of all. The Akula\\u2019s were the first Soviet submarines to compete with American submarines on noise, reportedly matching the Los Angeles class at most speeds. Displacing 8000 tons, the Akulas could both outrun and outgun the American Los Angeles class, making up to 35 knots and carrying a larger array of torpedoes and cruise missiles.\\n\\nSteel hulled (unlike their Sierra and Alfa predecessors), the Akulas also achieved cost-savings while improving mission capability, a rare feat for a modern weapon system. Five Akulas entered service before the Cold War ended, with a total of fifteen eventually entering service. Nine remain in Russian service, with another on loan to the Indian Navy.\", \"author\": \"Robert Farley\", \"url\": \"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/death-deep-five-best-cold-war-submarines-116941\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 00:00 EST\", \"published_utc\": 1580014800, \"collection_utc\": 1580042634}",News,1580014800
