Since the beginning of the year, the American side has moved to the tactics of blocking the movements of Russian troops on the strategically important M4 highway (Aleppo \\u2013 Rakka \\u2013 Hasake), demonstrating with all its appearance that the United States is still too early to write off at the Syrian military-political theater. Russia responds with a consistent strengthening of its position in the north-east of the SAR, where more recently, overseas \\u201cpartners\\u201d reigned supreme.\\n\\nThe competitive approach of Russia and the United States in Syria began in the skies of an Arab country, to this day moving into the ground phase. A hotline between the military of the two world powers was established with the aim of eliminating incidents in the airspace. It still operates with varying success, but on land the interaction to avoid collisions was clearly not set. The Pentagon followed agreements on the aerial component of deconfliction very selectively. There are several cases where the US Air Force operations in the Syrian sky, which affected the interests of Russia, its military group in the SAR was not made known. The Americans kept their hands free in the Syrian sky right up to the climax of the \\u201clead\\u201d of their Russian colleagues in October last year,Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi . The hunt for him was conducted by the VKS, as well as the Special Operations Forces of the RF Armed Forces. Having \\u201clost\\u201d the leader of the Ishilovites to the Americans, the Russian military immediately \\u201crecouped\\u201d on the ground. Moreover, they succeeded with the direct participation of Turkey \\u2013 the so-called US ally in NATO.\\n\\nAnkara puzzled Washington with the launch of Operation Source of Peace in northeast Syria against American wards in the face of the Kurdish People\\u2019s Self-Defense Forces (YPG). It was so perplexing that before the invasion of the Turkish army on October 9, Donald Trump gave the order to withdraw all American troops from the north-east of the Arab Republic. But then he changed his mind and returned a part of the contingent retiring to neighboring Iraq.\\n\\nIt turned out to be a very paradoxical situation, which, as we can safely assume, to the current stage led the Americans to use the tactics of ground blocking of the Russian military. The fact is that the Turkish \\u201cSource of Peace\\u201d was stopped precisely by the Americans after eight days from the start of the operation \\u2013 October 17. On that day, a second person arrived at Ankara with a special mission in the White House \\u2013 Vice President Michael Pence . The fighting in Syria was essentially stopped by the Americans, but the Russian side took advantage of the pause of the \\u201cSource of Peace\\u201d. On October 22, the head of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Sochi to negotiate with Vladimir Putin and agreed to sign a memorandum on northeast Syria.\\n\\nAccording to the agreement, Russia undertook to ensure the withdrawal of Kurdish YPGs from the Turkish \\u201csecurity zone\\u201d \\u2013 a 120-kilometer-long and 30-kilometer-deep section of the territory between the Syrian cities of Tel Abyad (Rakka province) and Ras al-Ain (Hasake ave. ) Another point of the Russian-Turkish agreement was the deployment of joint patrols on the territory \\u201ccleared\\u201d of Kurds to the west and east of the \\u201csecurity zone\\u201d. It so happened that Moscow took on the mission that Washington had successfully failed at one time, for Ankara was pushing for Washington to withdraw the Kurdish militia from the Syrian regions bordering with Turkey. Moreover, a joint patrol mechanism was launched, which meant a very simple thing \\u2013 Turkey actually brought Russia by hand to that part of Syria.\\n\\nResentment against the NATO ally and anger at a potential Russian enemy, the US military began to take out the same blocking of roads. Yielding to emotions, the Americans hastily left several bases and strongholds in the north and east of Syria in the first half of October. The resulting \\u201cvacuum\\u201d filled the Russian command. Closer to the Syrian-Iraqi border, tactical aircraft of the Russian Air Force, units of the army special forces and military police were deployed. In the Arab media, there were even reports about the deployment by Russia near Iraq of several batteries of anti-aircraft missile systems (SAM) S-400, allegedly deployed from the Khmeimim air base in Syrian Latakia.\\n\\nWhether the \\u201cvacuum\\u201d was created due to the feverish movement of the Americans across the border of the two Arab countries, including the new deployment of the S-400 air defense system, seems dubious. But full of publications about the Russian rush to the east of Syria, to the places of the former US-based, the Arab press is pretty annoyed with the American warriors. And they answered in a peculiar way, having transformed for a while from the Marines into a harsh \\u201croad patrol service\\u201d along the M4 highway.\\n\\nRecall that the US military since the beginning of the year has shown great aggressiveness towards the Russian presence in northeastern Syria. So, on January 21, they again blocked the movement of two Russian military convoys to checkpoints under the control of government forces in the Arab Republic. According to local military sources, the first Russian convoy was blocked by the Americans at a fork in the village of Tel Baidar, located in the northern part of Hasak province, near the city of Kamyshly (the capital of the Syrian Kurdistan, which was removed from the framework of the Sochi memorandum of October 22). The second Russian convoy was blocked by a division of the US Armed Forces near the city of Malikiya in the same province.\\n\\nSince the beginning of this year, the US military has become increasingly hostile to Russian and Syrian \\u201ccolleagues\\u201d in the north-eastern part of the SAR, Arab media say. The epicenter of it all is the M4 highway. The reason why the US impedes the movement of the Russian and Syrian military is not officially explained by the Pentagon. However , veiled signals from the US Department of Defense have previously appeared in the American media that, in this way, \\u201cRussian capture of oil fields in northeast Syria\\u201d is being prevented.\\n\\nOn January 15, a Russian military convoy was stopped on its way to one of the oil fields in the Rumeilan region, where the US air base is located. A Russian convoy of 60 vehicles advanced from the base in the Tel Tamra area. The task of the military of the Russian Federation included the creation of a checkpoint in this region of Syria.\\n\\nUS Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced October 21 last year that the Donald Trump administration would leave part of the US military in the oil field in eastern Syria, where the Kurdish \\u201cSyrian Democratic Forces\\u201d are located. The Russian Ministry of Defense issued a statement in which it indicated that the United States is engaged in \\u201crobbery on a state scale\\u201d in Syria, carrying out industrial mining in illegally seized areas of the country. This is evidenced by published satellite images of the Russian Ministry of Defense, which depicts the process of oil extraction by the Americans on Syrian territory and its subsequent export. As recalled by the military department, Syrian oil, both before and after the victory over the IS in Zaevfraty, was \\u201cactively extracted by the reliable guard of the US military.\\u201d\\n\\nIt is hard to say how long the lawlessness of the American DPS in Syria will last. There is a noteworthy assumption that the Americans will quickly \\u201ctire\\u201d of obstructing the Russian military on Syrian roads and will move on to the old and relatively effective tactic of \\u201cdeterring Russians\\u201d. This is a demonstration of even greater freedom of hands in the sky of the SAR, with a hint of a possible rejection of the airborne component of deconfliction, if the Russian military continues to squeeze the \\u201cpartners\\u201d in Zaevfrati, systematically narrowing their operational space on the ground. Therefore, one should most seriously prepare for the provocations of the US Air Force in the form of \\u201caccidental strikes\\u201d on the Syrian government forces, which could also hurt Russian troops. Good, Americans for such provocations have an \\u201calibi\\u201d in the form of a \\u201cterrorist target\\u201d they have chosen everywhere in the Middle East \\u2014 the Iranian special forces \\u201cKods\\u201d as part of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). There are not so many Iranians in northeast Syria, but this may not particularly concern Americans. That\\u2019s the \\u201caccident\\u201d when you allegedly aim at one, but you fall into another. In the one who was the real goal.\\n\\n* U.S. President Donald Trump first gave the command in December 2018 to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria. But then he decided to leave a \\u201climited contingent\\u201d of 400 US soldiers and officers (at the end of last year, about 2,200 US troops were in the SAR). In October, Trump again ordered the complete withdrawal of troops from northeastern Syria (about 1 thousand US troops) before Turkey launched Operation Source of Peace against Kurdish militias in this part of the Arab Republic. However, then the White House and the Pentagon again outplayed their previous plans, saying they were now ready to leave 500 to 600 US troops to protect its oil fields from IS fighters.\", \"author\": \"Guest Author\", \"url\": \"https://www.fort-russ.com/2020/01/syria-russian-us-forces-close-to-open-conflict-in-depth/\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 16:22:05 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580073725, \"collection_utc\": 1580083465}",News,1580073725

He would not confirm who had died until all the next of kin have been notified, he said.\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s death stunned Los Angeles and the sports world, which mourned one of basketball\\u2019s greatest players. Sources said the helicopter took off from Orange County, where Bryant lived.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas. Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby. Responders included 56 fire personnel \\u2014 firefighters, a helicopter with paramedics, hand crews \\u2014 and sheriff\\u2019s deputies.\\n\\n\\u201cOur firefighters hiked into the accident site with their medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the stubborn fire as it included the brush fire \\u2026 and the helicopter,\\u201d Osby said during a news conference Sunday afternoon. \\u201cThe fire also included magnesium, which is very hard for firefighters to extinguish because magnesium reacts with oxygen and water.\\u201d\\n\\nFirefighter-paramedics were hoisted into the crash zone early on to look for survivors, Osby said. All nine people on board had died, Villanueva said at the news conference. The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash, and the Los Angeles County coroner\\u2019s office is working on retrieving the bodies and identifying the victims.\\n\\nOrange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli was among those who died in the crash, the college confirmed. As a mentor and coach for 27 years, he helped students earn scholarships to play at four-year colleges and treated players like family, the statement said.\\n\\n\\u201cCoach Altobelli was a giant on our campus \\u2014 a beloved teacher, coach, colleague and friend. This is a tremendous loss for our campus community,\\u201d OCC President Angelica Suarez said in a statement.\\n\\nThe Times is offering coverage of Kobe Bryant\\u2019s death for free today. Please consider a subscription to support our journalism.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene inside Staples Center around noon Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place, as word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena. Crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring the former NBA star.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase the skills that made him a top candidate for rookie of the year. Those skills were also on display when Bryant won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\n\\u201cKobe Bryant was a giant who inspired, amazed, and thrilled people everywhere with his incomparable skill on the court \\u2014 and awed us with his intellect and humility as a father, husband, creative genius, and ambassador for the game he loved,\\u201d L.A.

Please consider a subscription to support our journalism.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene inside Staples Center around noon Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place, as word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena. Crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring the former NBA star.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase the skills that made him a top candidate for rookie of the year. Those skills were also on display when Bryant won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring.

But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\n\\u201cKobe Bryant was a giant who inspired, amazed, and thrilled people everywhere with his incomparable skill on the court \\u2014 and awed us with his intellect and humility as a father, husband, creative genius, and ambassador for the game he loved,\\u201d L.A.

The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene inside Staples Center around noon Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place, as word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena. Crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring the former NBA star.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase the skills that made him a top candidate for rookie of the year.

The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene inside Staples Center around noon Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place, as word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena. Crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring the former NBA star.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase the skills that made him a top candidate for rookie of the year. Those skills were also on display when Bryant won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\n\\u201cKobe Bryant was a giant who inspired, amazed, and thrilled people everywhere with his incomparable skill on the court \\u2014 and awed us with his intellect and humility as a father, husband, creative genius, and ambassador for the game he loved,\\u201d L.A.

But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\n\\u201cKobe Bryant was a giant who inspired, amazed, and thrilled people everywhere with his incomparable skill on the court \\u2014 and awed us with his intellect and humility as a father, husband, creative genius, and ambassador for the game he loved,\\u201d L.A.

The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene inside Staples Center around noon Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place, as word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena. Crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring the former NBA star.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase the skills that made him a top candidate for rookie of the year. Those skills were also on display when Bryant won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December.

Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\n\\u201cKobe Bryant was a giant who inspired, amazed, and thrilled people everywhere with his incomparable skill on the court \\u2014 and awed us with his intellect and humility as a father, husband, creative genius, and ambassador for the game he loved,\\u201d L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a news statement Sunday afternoon. \\u201cHe will live forever in the heart of Los Angeles, and will be remembered through the ages as one of our greatest heroes.\\u201d\\n\\nTimes staff writers Nathan Fenno, David Carrillo, Michael DiGiovanna, Chris Erskine, Alex Wigglesworth, Broderick Turner, Cindy Carcamo and Gustavo Arellano contributed to this report.\", \"author\": \"Richard Winton, Dan Woike, Sonali Kohli, Tania Ganguli\", \"url\": \"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 19:03:42 -0500\", \"published_utc\": 1580083422, \"collection_utc\": 1580085073}",News,1580083422

Sources said the helicopter took off from Orange County, where Bryant lived.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas. Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby.

Please consider a subscription to support our journalism.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene inside Staples Center around noon Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place, as word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena. Crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring the former NBA star.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase the skills that made him a top candidate for rookie of the year. Those skills were also on display when Bryant won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title.

The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene inside Staples Center around noon Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place, as word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena. Crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring the former NBA star.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase the skills that made him a top candidate for rookie of the year. Those skills were also on display when Bryant won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\n\\u201cKobe Bryant was a giant who inspired, amazed, and thrilled people everywhere with his incomparable skill on the court \\u2014 and awed us with his intellect and humility as a father, husband, creative genius, and ambassador for the game he loved,\\u201d L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a news statement Sunday afternoon. \\u201cHe will live forever in the heart of Los Angeles, and will be remembered through the ages as one of our greatest heroes.\\u201d\\n\\nTimes staff writers Nathan Fenno, David Carrillo, Michael DiGiovanna, Chris Erskine, Alex Wigglesworth, Broderick Turner, Cindy Carcamo and Gustavo Arellano contributed to this report.\", \"author\": \"Richard Winton, Dan Woike, Sonali Kohli, Tania Ganguli\", \"url\": \"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 19:03:42 -0500\", \"published_utc\": 1580083422, \"collection_utc\": 1580085073}",News,1580083422

The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\n\\u201cKobe Bryant was a giant who inspired, amazed, and thrilled people everywhere with his incomparable skill on the court \\u2014 and awed us with his intellect and humility as a father, husband, creative genius, and ambassador for the game he loved,\\u201d L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a news statement Sunday afternoon. \\u201cHe will live forever in the heart of Los Angeles, and will be remembered through the ages as one of our greatest heroes.\\u201d\\n\\nTimes staff writers Nathan Fenno, David Carrillo, Michael DiGiovanna, Chris Erskine, Alex Wigglesworth, Broderick Turner, Cindy Carcamo and Gustavo Arellano contributed to this report.\", \"author\": \"Richard Winton, Dan Woike, Sonali Kohli, Tania Ganguli\", \"url\": \"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 19:03:42 -0500\", \"published_utc\": 1580083422, \"collection_utc\": 1580085073}",News,1580083422

At the same time, the employment rate among Hispanics is at historic highs.At this point, the Democrats will invariably mention Trump's promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, a promise that arguably won the real estate developer the White House in 2016.

The far more logical explanation for this massive change in political sentiment is that Trump's plan to remedy America's dangerously porous borders, thereby enhancing the security of all Americans, regardless of skin color, was a welcomed idea across the board.Nevertheless, the real danger is that the Democrats, entranced by the cult of political correctness and an out-of-control cancel culture, will attempt by some extreme measures to identify and ban so-called 'racist Trump supporters' who are just regular Americans looking for a leader who will provide them with a well-guarded country that protects the rights of all its citizens regardless of skin color. Banning undesirable Trump voters from the ballet box may eventually become as easy as censoring right-leaning Twitter users.- to quote Hillary Clinton - and have only worsened their present position by calling these same voters, many of them former Obama supporters, \\\"racist.\\\" Such a gross simplification and misunderstanding of the current American political realities goes far at explaining why the Democrats stand very little chance of beating Trump at the ballot box.\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.sott.net/article/428049-NBC-hack-Noah-Berlatsky-says-racist-Trump-supporters-should-lose-their-vote-Guess-who-decides-they-re-racist\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 20:05:44 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580087144, \"collection_utc\": 1580085228}",News,1580087144

In fact, while emissions growth from oil has been fairly steady over the past decade at 1.4% a year, emissions from natural gas have grown almost twice as fast at 2.4% a year, and are estimated to further accelerate to 2.6% in 2019. Natural gas is the single largest contributor to this year\\u2019s increase in global CO\\u2082 emissions.\\n\\nThis uptick in natural gas consumption is driven by a range of factors. New, \\u201cunconventional\\u201d methods of extracting natural gas in the US have increased production. This boom is in part replacing coal for electricity generation.\\n\\nRead more: How to answer the argument that Australia's emissions are too small to make a difference\\n\\nIn Japan, natural gas is filling the void left by nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster. In most of the rest of the world, new natural gas capacity is primarily filling new energy demand.\\n\\nOil emissions, on the other hand, are largely being driven by the rapidly growing transport sector. This is increasing across land, sea and air, but is dominated by road transport.\\n\\nAustralia\\u2019s emissions have also seen significant reductions from coal sources over the past decade, while emissions from oil and natural gas have grown rapidly and are driving the country\\u2019s overall growth in fossil CO\\u2082 emissions.\\n\\nCO\\u2082 emissions from fossil fuels in Australia (in million tonnes). Data Source: UNFCCC, CDIAC, BP, USGS \\n\\n\\n\\nPreliminary estimates for 2019 show that global emissions from deforestation, fires and other land-use changes reached 6 billion tonnes of CO\\u2082 \\u2013 about 0.8 billion tonnes above 2018 levels. The additional emissions largely come from elevated fire and deforestation activity in the Amazon and Southeast Asia.\\n\\nThe accelerated loss of forests in 2019 not only leads to higher emissions, but reduces the capacity of vegetation to act as a \\u201csink\\u201d removing CO\\u2082 from the atmosphere. This is deeply concerning, as the world\\u2019s oceans and plants absorb about half of all CO\\u2082 emissions from human activities. They are one of our most effective buffers against even higher CO\\u2082 concentrations in the atmosphere, and must be safeguarded.\\n\\nFires and deforestation in the Amazon and Southeast Asia drove a new record high in land-related emissions. Global Carbon Project 2019\\n\\nNot all sinks can be managed by people \\u2013 the open ocean sink being an example \\u2013 but land-based sinks can be actively protected by preventing deforestation and degradation, and further enhanced by ecosystem restoration and reforestation.\\n\\nFor every year in which global emissions grow, the goals of the Paris Agreement are one step further removed from being achievable. We know many ways to decarbonise economies that are good for people and the environment. Some countries are showing it is possible. It is time for the rest of the world to join them.\\n\\nCorinne Le Qu\\u00e9r\\u00e9 receives funding from the European Commission (Horizon 2020), the UK Research Councils, the Royal Society.

He was 41.\\n\\nBryant was on board the helicopter along with eight others when it crashed at 10am local time near Calabasas, 30 miles north-west of downtown Los Angeles, in foggy weather. The crash ignited brushfires, making it hard for rescue crews to get close to the site. There were no reported survivors, and although authorities did not confirm the identity of any of the victims, Bryant\\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, is also believed to have died in the crash. Bryant had lived in the area for most of his life and often used helicopters to beat Los Angeles\\u2019s heavy traffic.\\n\\n\\u201cWe received a call just before 10am this morning of an aircraft down in the Malibu area, right off of Las Vergenes, essentially Calabasas,\\u201d Tony Imbrenda of the Los Angeles county fire department, told reporters at the scene. \\u201cSome folks were out here mountain biking this morning, they saw an aircraft in distress, they went down into the hillside. This was a helicopter, it\\u2019s been confirmed it was an S-76 Sikorsky helicopter and unfortunately there were no survivors.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board said they will investigate the accident.\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s talent was obvious from an early age, and he was already attracting national attention while still in high school. Unlike most NBA players, he went straight from school to the NBA, foregoing a college career. He played his entire, 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers, where he won five championships with the team and was named an All-Star on 18 occasions. He retired in 2016 as the NBA\\u2019s third-highest all-time scorer. He also won gold medals with Team USA at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics.\\n\\n\\u201cThe NBA family is devastated by the tragic passing of Kobe Bryantand his daughter, Gianna,\\u201d the NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, said in a statement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cFor 20 seasons, Kobe showed us what is possible when remarkable talent blends with an absolute devotion to winning. He was one of the most extraordinary players in the history of our game with accomplishments that are legendary: five NBA championships, an NBA MVP award, 18 NBA All-Star selections, and two Olympic gold medals. But he will be remembered most for inspiring people around the world to pick up a basketball and compete to the very best of their ability.\\n\\n\\u201cHe was generous with the wisdom he acquired and saw it as his mission to share it with future generations of players, taking special delight in passing down his love of the game to Gianna.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant moved into the media following his retirement and in 2018 he won an Oscar for best animated short for a film called Dear Basketball, based on a poem he wrote about his retirement from the game.\\n\\nHowever, Bryant\\u2019s reputation was tarnished after he was arrested in 2003 over accusations he had raped a teenager at a hotel in Colorado. Bryant denied the allegations, saying the encounter had been consensual. The case was dropped after the alleged victim refused to testify at trial. Bryant later apologised to the woman, saying \\u201cI recognise now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did\\u201d. Bryant and the woman later settled a separate civil suit out of court.\\n\\nOn Saturday night another NBA legend, LeBron James, had paid tribute to Bryant after passing him to become the third-highest scorer in the league\\u2019s history.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is someone that I used as inspiration. It was like, wow. Seeing a kid, 17 years old, come into the NBA and trying to make an impact on a franchise, I used it as motivation,\\u201d said James.\\n\\nAnother of Bryant\\u2019s fellow Los Angeles Lakers greats, Magic Johnson, gave his thoughts on Sunday\\u2019s news. \\u201cMy friend, a legend, husband, father, son, brother, Oscar winner and greatest Laker of all-time is gone,\\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to accept. Kobe was a leader of our game, a mentor to both male and female players.\\u201d\\n\\nFigures outside of basketball also reacted to the news. \\u201cAs I tweet through my tears, I am so hurt,\\u201d wrote civil rights activist Jesse Jackson. \\u201cI cannot stop crying. Kobe was instrumental to so many people. There is a hole in the basketball world and there will be for a long time.

Bryant had lived in the area for most of his life and often used helicopters to beat Los Angeles\\u2019s heavy traffic.\\n\\n\\u201cWe received a call just before 10am this morning of an aircraft down in the Malibu area, right off of Las Vergenes, essentially Calabasas,\\u201d Tony Imbrenda of the Los Angeles county fire department, told reporters at the scene. \\u201cSome folks were out here mountain biking this morning, they saw an aircraft in distress, they went down into the hillside. This was a helicopter, it\\u2019s been confirmed it was an S-76 Sikorsky helicopter and unfortunately there were no survivors.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board said they will investigate the accident.\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s talent was obvious from an early age, and he was already attracting national attention while still in high school. Unlike most NBA players, he went straight from school to the NBA, foregoing a college career. He played his entire, 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers, where he won five championships with the team and was named an All-Star on 18 occasions. He retired in 2016 as the NBA\\u2019s third-highest all-time scorer. He also won gold medals with Team USA at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics.\\n\\n\\u201cThe NBA family is devastated by the tragic passing of Kobe Bryantand his daughter, Gianna,\\u201d the NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, said in a statement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cFor 20 seasons, Kobe showed us what is possible when remarkable talent blends with an absolute devotion to winning. He was one of the most extraordinary players in the history of our game with accomplishments that are legendary: five NBA championships, an NBA MVP award, 18 NBA All-Star selections, and two Olympic gold medals. But he will be remembered most for inspiring people around the world to pick up a basketball and compete to the very best of their ability.\\n\\n\\u201cHe was generous with the wisdom he acquired and saw it as his mission to share it with future generations of players, taking special delight in passing down his love of the game to Gianna.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant moved into the media following his retirement and in 2018 he won an Oscar for best animated short for a film called Dear Basketball, based on a poem he wrote about his retirement from the game.\\n\\nHowever, Bryant\\u2019s reputation was tarnished after he was arrested in 2003 over accusations he had raped a teenager at a hotel in Colorado. Bryant denied the allegations, saying the encounter had been consensual. The case was dropped after the alleged victim refused to testify at trial. Bryant later apologised to the woman, saying \\u201cI recognise now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did\\u201d. Bryant and the woman later settled a separate civil suit out of court.\\n\\nOn Saturday night another NBA legend, LeBron James, had paid tribute to Bryant after passing him to become the third-highest scorer in the league\\u2019s history.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is someone that I used as inspiration. It was like, wow. Seeing a kid, 17 years old, come into the NBA and trying to make an impact on a franchise, I used it as motivation,\\u201d said James.\\n\\nAnother of Bryant\\u2019s fellow Los Angeles Lakers greats, Magic Johnson, gave his thoughts on Sunday\\u2019s news. \\u201cMy friend, a legend, husband, father, son, brother, Oscar winner and greatest Laker of all-time is gone,\\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to accept. Kobe was a leader of our game, a mentor to both male and female players.\\u201d\\n\\nFigures outside of basketball also reacted to the news. \\u201cAs I tweet through my tears, I am so hurt,\\u201d wrote civil rights activist Jesse Jackson. \\u201cI cannot stop crying. Kobe was instrumental to so many people. There is a hole in the basketball world and there will be for a long time. Rest in heavenly peace.\\u201d\\n\\nPlayers and fans observed a minute\\u2019s silence at the first scheduled NBA game on Sunday, an encounter between the Denver Nuggets and the Houston Rockets. Bryant\\u2019s name was chanted at the NFL\\u2019s annual Pro Bowl game, which took place in Orlando on Sunday as news of his death broke.\\n\\nThe Lakers\\u2019 next game is on Tuesday at their home arena, the Staples Center, against their cross-city rivals, the Clippers. Fans gathered outside the arena on Sunday, many wearing jerseys bearing Bryant\\u2019s name. \\u201cThe city is bleeding right now,\\u201d said one fan, Edgar Ruiz. \\u201cI always felt the energy when he was in the building. That was my idol. Fans were inspired by his work ethic ... it\\u2019s hard to take in because he had such a big impact in our community, he did so many great things in LA.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant was married to Vanessa, with whom he had four daughters, including Gianna. His father, Joe, also played in the NBA.\", \"author\": \"Tom Lutz in New York\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/26/kobe-bryant-helicopter-crash-death-nba-los-angeles-lakers\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 23:38:24 GMT\", \"published_utc\": 1580099904, \"collection_utc\": 1580084657}",News,1580099904

Please consider a subscription to support our journalism.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene inside Staples Center around noon Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place, as word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena. Crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring the former NBA star.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase the skills that made him a top candidate for rookie of the year. Those skills were also on display when Bryant won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\n\\u201cKobe Bryant was a giant who inspired, amazed, and thrilled people everywhere with his incomparable skill on the court \\u2014 and awed us with his intellect and humility as a father, husband, creative genius, and ambassador for the game he loved,\\u201d L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a news statement Sunday afternoon. \\u201cHe will live forever in the heart of Los Angeles, and will be remembered through the ages as one of our greatest heroes.\\u201d\\n\\nTimes staff writers Nathan Fenno, Michael DiGiovanna, Chris Erskine, Alex Wigglesworth, Broderick Turner, Cindy Carcamo and Gustavo Arellano contributed to this report.\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DrudgeReportFeed/~3/BPK_QLdHink/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 00:16:37 GMT\", \"published_utc\": 1580102197, \"collection_utc\": 1580084356}",News,1580102197

Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase the skills that made him a top candidate for rookie of the year. Those skills were also on display when Bryant won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\n\\u201cKobe Bryant was a giant who inspired, amazed, and thrilled people everywhere with his incomparable skill on the court \\u2014 and awed us with his intellect and humility as a father, husband, creative genius, and ambassador for the game he loved,\\u201d L.A.

NBA officials confirmed that Bryant and his daughter were on the aircraft, and Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said nine people were on board \\u2014 a pilot and eight passengers. He would not confirm who had died until all the next of kin have been notified, he said.\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s death stunned Los Angeles and the sports world, which mourned one of basketball\\u2019s greatest players. Sources said the helicopter took off from Orange County, where Bryant lived.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas. Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby. Responders included 56 fire personnel \\u2014 firefighters, a helicopter with paramedics, hand crews \\u2014 and sheriff\\u2019s deputies.\\n\\n\\u201cOur firefighters hiked into the accident site with their medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the stubborn fire as it included the brush fire \\u2026 and the helicopter,\\u201d Osby said during a news conference Sunday afternoon. \\u201cThe fire also included magnesium, which is very hard for firefighters to extinguish because magnesium reacts with oxygen and water.\\u201d\\n\\nFirefighter-paramedics were hoisted into the crash zone early on to look for survivors, Osby said. All nine people on board had died, Villanueva said at the news conference. The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash, and the Los Angeles County coroner\\u2019s office is working on retrieving the bodies and identifying the victims.\\n\\nOrange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli was among those who died in the crash, the college confirmed.

The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene inside Staples Center around noon Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place, as word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena. Crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring the former NBA star.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register.

Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby.

The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash, and the Los Angeles County coroner\\u2019s office is working on retrieving the bodies and identifying the victims.\\n\\nOrange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli was among those who died in the crash, the college confirmed.

Please consider a subscription to support our journalism.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene inside Staples Center around noon Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place, as word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena. Crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring the former NBA star.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase the skills that made him a top candidate for rookie of the year. Those skills were also on display when Bryant won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\n\\u201cKobe Bryant was a giant who inspired, amazed, and thrilled people everywhere with his incomparable skill on the court \\u2014 and awed us with his intellect and humility as a father, husband, creative genius, and ambassador for the game he loved,\\u201d L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a news statement Sunday afternoon. \\u201cHe will live forever in the heart of Los Angeles, and will be remembered through the ages as one of our greatest heroes.\\u201d\\n\\nTimes staff writers Nathan Fenno, Michael DiGiovanna, Chris Erskine, Alex Wigglesworth, Broderick Turner, Cindy Carcamo and Gustavo Arellano contributed to this report.\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DrudgeReportFeed/~3/BPK_QLdHink/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 00:16:37 GMT\", \"published_utc\": 1580102197, \"collection_utc\": 1580084356}",News,1580102197

He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\n\\u201cKobe Bryant was a giant who inspired, amazed, and thrilled people everywhere with his incomparable skill on the court \\u2014 and awed us with his intellect and humility as a father, husband, creative genius, and ambassador for the game he loved,\\u201d L.A.

The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene inside Staples Center around noon Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place, as word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena. Crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring the former NBA star.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase the skills that made him a top candidate for rookie of the year. Those skills were also on display when Bryant won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative.

He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase the skills that made him a top candidate for rookie of the year. Those skills were also on display when Bryant won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\n\\u201cKobe Bryant was a giant who inspired, amazed, and thrilled people everywhere with his incomparable skill on the court \\u2014 and awed us with his intellect and humility as a father, husband, creative genius, and ambassador for the game he loved,\\u201d L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a news statement Sunday afternoon. \\u201cHe will live forever in the heart of Los Angeles, and will be remembered through the ages as one of our greatest heroes.\\u201d\\n\\nTimes staff writers Nathan Fenno, Michael DiGiovanna, Chris Erskine, Alex Wigglesworth, Broderick Turner, Cindy Carcamo and Gustavo Arellano contributed to this report.\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DrudgeReportFeed/~3/BPK_QLdHink/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 00:16:37 GMT\", \"published_utc\": 1580102197, \"collection_utc\": 1580084356}",News,1580102197

He would not confirm who had died until all the next of kin have been notified, he said.\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s death stunned Los Angeles and the sports world, which mourned one of basketball\\u2019s greatest players. Sources said the helicopter took off from Orange County, where Bryant lived.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas.

The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents.

Crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring the former NBA star.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person.

His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova.

Please consider a subscription to support our journalism.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene inside Staples Center around noon Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place, as word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena. Crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring the former NBA star.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase the skills that made him a top candidate for rookie of the year. Those skills were also on display when Bryant won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\n\\u201cKobe Bryant was a giant who inspired, amazed, and thrilled people everywhere with his incomparable skill on the court \\u2014 and awed us with his intellect and humility as a father, husband, creative genius, and ambassador for the game he loved,\\u201d L.A.

The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\n\\u201cKobe Bryant was a giant who inspired, amazed, and thrilled people everywhere with his incomparable skill on the court \\u2014 and awed us with his intellect and humility as a father, husband, creative genius, and ambassador for the game he loved,\\u201d L.A.

NBA officials confirmed that Bryant and his daughter were on the aircraft, and Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said nine people were on board \\u2014 a pilot and eight passengers. He would not confirm who had died until all the next of kin have been notified, he said.\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s death stunned Los Angeles and the sports world, which mourned one of basketball\\u2019s greatest players. Sources said the helicopter took off from Orange County, where Bryant lived.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas. Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby.

All nine people on board had died, Villanueva said at the news conference. The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash, and the Los Angeles County coroner\\u2019s office is working on retrieving the bodies and identifying the victims.\\n\\nOrange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli was among those who died in the crash, the college confirmed.

The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene inside Staples Center around noon Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place, as word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena. Crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring the former NBA star.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase the skills that made him a top candidate for rookie of the year. Those skills were also on display when Bryant won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals.

He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title.

As the UK government announced on June 11 that it had committed to a net zero emissions target for 2050, the French parliament is currently working on a draft energy and climate bill that has the same target for 2050.\\n\\nIn both cases, the net zero objective ramps up earlier targets. In France, it would replace one set by a 2015 energy transition law, which targeted a 75% cut in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. In the UK, net zero for 2050 replaces a previous target of an 80% reduction over the same period; it was introduced in the law on June 12. The increased ambition is the result of advice from the UK\\u2019s Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the country\\u2019s independent advisory body.\\n\\nFrance and the UK are the largest countries so far to set such an ambitious objective in legislation. Sweden, Denmark and Norway have already adopted the legal objective of carbon neutrality, but with the use of international emissions-trading mechanisms.\\n\\nThe French project and the recommendation of the CCC in UK do not include this type of mechanism, although the UK government announced it reserves the right to use credits. Other countries \\u2013 such as Ethiopia, Costa Rica, Bhutan, Fiji Islands, Iceland, Marshall Islands and Portugal \\u2013 have also announced plans for carbon neutrality by 2050 in strategic documents but without legislative scope.\\n\\nThe 2018 report of the IPCC indicates that to stabilise global warming at 1.5\\u00b0C, net emissions at the global scale must reach zero by 2050; and by 2070 for 2\\u00b0C.\\n\\nEmissions of other greenhouse gases must also be significantly reduced to maintain these trajectories. The CCC report also shows that neutrality of \\u201call greenhouse gases\\u201d by 2070 is compatible with the 1.5\\u00b0C trajectory. This means that the 2050 net zero emissions goal for all greenhouse gases is more ambitious than the global trajectory compatible with 1.5\\u00b0C warming.\\n\\nComparing emissions on both sides of the Channel\\n\\nFrance and the United Kingdom share many characteristics. They have similar populations, comparable levels of development and their territorial greenhouse-gas emissions are similar \\u2013 7 tCO\\u2082 per inhabitant for the United Kingdom and 6.7 tCO\\u2082 per inhabitant for France in 2017.\\n\\nEmission trajectories since 1990 have been decreasing overall, with a larger decrease for the UK from a higher level in 1990. This is mostly due to the transition away from coal-fired power plants for electricity, as well as a significant catch-up in waste management.\\n\\nC. Guivarch and C. Le Qu\\u00e9r\\u00e9, based on data from CITEPA (France) and BEIS (RU), Author provided\\n\\nEmissions from the industrial sector are decreasing significantly and similarly in both countries. According to CCC\\u2019s analysis, this decline in the United Kingdom can be explained by changes in economic structure, improved energy efficiency and a reduction in the carbon intensity of the energy mix.\\n\\nC. Guivarch and C. Le Qu\\u00e9r\\u00e9, based on data from CITEPA (France) and BEIS (RU), Author provided\\n\\nEmissions from the building sector have declined over the past 10 years in both countries, with larger decreases in the United Kingdom. In contrast, emissions from the transport sector have stagnated in both countries, with a slight decrease in the United Kingdom and an increase in France since 1990.\\n\\nHowever, important differences exist in agriculture and carbon sinks. Agriculture is economically more important in France, emitting twice as much carbon much as in the United Kingdom. Carbon sinks, which are largely based on the increase in carbon stored in forests, are also more significant in France. Emissions reduction in both sectors are comparable.\\n\\nC. Guivarch and C. Le Qu\\u00e9r\\u00e9, based on data from CITEPA (France) and BEIS (RU), Author provided\\n\\nOne important difference concerns emissions from international transport. Aviation and maritime transport emissions are not included in the reporting to the United Nations under the Paris Agreement. The UK\\u2019s net zero objective includes these emissions, while France\\u2019s current draft energy bill does not.\\n\\nIf the other sectors follow the projected reduction pathways, emissions from aviation, which are relatively low for the time being, will be responsible for the majority of remaining emissions in 2050. They will therefore have to be offset by carbon sinks or other CO extraction mechanisms, requiring a significant increase in the number of sinks (see figure below, based on data from the United Kingdomand France).\\n\\nC. Guivarch and C. Le Qu\\u00e9r\\u00e9, based on data from CITEPA (France) and BEIS (RU), Author provided \\n\\n\\n\\nIn their 2050 net zero objectives, France and the United Kingdom do not include so-called \\u201cimported\\u201d emissions \\u2013 those associated with consuming products and services from abroad.\\n\\nIncluding these imported emissions, the carbon footprints of both nations reach 11 tCO\\u2082/inhabitant/year for France and 11.9 tCO\\u2082/inhabitant/year for the United Kingdom.\\n\\nC. Guivarch and C. Le Qu\\u00e9r\\u00e9, based on data from CITEPA (France) and BEIS (RU), Author provided\\n\\nAfter accounting for products consumed abroad (\\u201cexported\\u201d emissions), emissions from the trade balance are very high and have risen since the mid-1990s (see figure opposite) with a possible slowdown since 2005 in the United Kingdom and since 2011 in France. These emissions are difficult to control, they are nevertheless the responsibility of consumers.\\n\\nWhile France\\u2019s draft energy and climate law states that these emissions must be controlled, it gives no quantitative targets. In the UK, the CCC recommendation is that these emissions should decline in response to certain efficiency measures, but recognizes that these emissions can only be reduced to zero when global emissions reach this threshold.\\n\\nThe United Kingdom has managed to rapidly reduce its emissions over the past decade, which are now close to the French level. This rapid decrease was recommended and monitored by the Committee on Climate Change, which has prioritized the decarbonisation of electricity production that underlies that of other sectors. Today, both countries are at a point where emissions must decrease rapidly in the coming decades to reach their net zero targets by 2050.\\n\\nA shared challenge is initiating and accelerating the transition in sectors that are tough to decarbonise because, compared with the energy sector, emissions are more diffuse \\u2013 particularly transport and buildings.\\n\\nThe Haut Conseil pour le Climat, of which we are both members, was created in late 2018 and directly inspired by the UK CCC. There is no magic policy package that will lead nations to net zero emissions in 2050. The UK example demonstrates, and France acknowledges, the need for an independent advisory group that is focused on the long-term to support and guide the transition in the coming decades.\\n\\nThe French Haut Conseil will assess the implementation of France\\u2019s national low-carbon strategy and propose course corrections where necessary, while taking into account the socio-economic impacts of the transition on households and businesses as well as environmental impacts. Its first report will be made public on June 25.\\n\\nC\\u00e9line Guivarch is part of the team of authors of the 6th IPCC report. She is a member of the French High Council for Climate Change.

As the UK government announced on June 11 that it had committed to a net zero emissions target for 2050, the French parliament is currently working on a draft energy and climate bill that has the same target for 2050.\\n\\nIn both cases, the net zero objective ramps up earlier targets. In France, it would replace one set by a 2015 energy transition law, which targeted a 75% cut in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. In the UK, net zero for 2050 replaces a previous target of an 80% reduction over the same period; it was introduced in the law on June 12. The increased ambition is the result of advice from the UK\\u2019s Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the country\\u2019s independent advisory body.\\n\\nFrance and the UK are the largest countries so far to set such an ambitious objective in legislation. Sweden, Denmark and Norway have already adopted the legal objective of carbon neutrality, but with the use of international emissions-trading mechanisms.\\n\\nThe French project and the recommendation of the CCC in UK do not include this type of mechanism, although the UK government announced it reserves the right to use credits.

As the UK government announced on June 11 that it had committed to a net zero emissions target for 2050, the French parliament is currently working on a draft energy and climate bill that has the same target for 2050.\\n\\nIn both cases, the net zero objective ramps up earlier targets. In France, it would replace one set by a 2015 energy transition law, which targeted a 75% cut in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. In the UK, net zero for 2050 replaces a previous target of an 80% reduction over the same period; it was introduced in the law on June 12. The increased ambition is the result of advice from the UK\\u2019s Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the country\\u2019s independent advisory body.\\n\\nFrance and the UK are the largest countries so far to set such an ambitious objective in legislation. Sweden, Denmark and Norway have already adopted the legal objective of carbon neutrality, but with the use of international emissions-trading mechanisms.\\n\\nThe French project and the recommendation of the CCC in UK do not include this type of mechanism, although the UK government announced it reserves the right to use credits. Other countries \\u2013 such as Ethiopia, Costa Rica, Bhutan, Fiji Islands, Iceland, Marshall Islands and Portugal \\u2013 have also announced plans for carbon neutrality by 2050 in strategic documents but without legislative scope.\\n\\nThe 2018 report of the IPCC indicates that to stabilise global warming at 1.5\\u00b0C, net emissions at the global scale must reach zero by 2050; and by 2070 for 2\\u00b0C.\\n\\nEmissions of other greenhouse gases must also be significantly reduced to maintain these trajectories. The CCC report also shows that neutrality of \\u201call greenhouse gases\\u201d by 2070 is compatible with the 1.5\\u00b0C trajectory. This means that the 2050 net zero emissions goal for all greenhouse gases is more ambitious than the global trajectory compatible with 1.5\\u00b0C warming.\\n\\nComparing emissions on both sides of the Channel\\n\\nFrance and the United Kingdom share many characteristics.

This is mostly due to the transition away from coal-fired power plants for electricity, as well as a significant catch-up in waste management.\\n\\nC. Guivarch and C. Le Qu\\u00e9r\\u00e9, based on data from CITEPA (France) and BEIS (RU), Author provided\\n\\nEmissions from the industrial sector are decreasing significantly and similarly in both countries. According to CCC\\u2019s analysis, this decline in the United Kingdom can be explained by changes in economic structure, improved energy efficiency and a reduction in the carbon intensity of the energy mix.\\n\\nC. Guivarch and C. Le Qu\\u00e9r\\u00e9, based on data from CITEPA (France) and BEIS (RU), Author provided\\n\\nEmissions from the building sector have declined over the past 10 years in both countries, with larger decreases in the United Kingdom. In contrast, emissions from the transport sector have stagnated in both countries, with a slight decrease in the United Kingdom and an increase in France since 1990.\\n\\nHowever, important differences exist in agriculture and carbon sinks. Agriculture is economically more important in France, emitting twice as much carbon much as in the United Kingdom. Carbon sinks, which are largely based on the increase in carbon stored in forests, are also more significant in France. Emissions reduction in both sectors are comparable.\\n\\nC. Guivarch and C. Le Qu\\u00e9r\\u00e9, based on data from CITEPA (France) and BEIS (RU), Author provided\\n\\nOne important difference concerns emissions from international transport. Aviation and maritime transport emissions are not included in the reporting to the United Nations under the Paris Agreement. The UK\\u2019s net zero objective includes these emissions, while France\\u2019s current draft energy bill does not.\\n\\nIf the other sectors follow the projected reduction pathways, emissions from aviation, which are relatively low for the time being, will be responsible for the majority of remaining emissions in 2050. They will therefore have to be offset by carbon sinks or other CO extraction mechanisms, requiring a significant increase in the number of sinks (see figure below, based on data from the United Kingdomand France).\\n\\nC.

Especially here.\\n\\nColorado is forever entrenched in the Kobe narrative, the site of professional zeniths and his personal nadir, the place where myths were made \\u2014 and a career almost went off the rails.\\n\\nIn the summer of 1996, Nuggets coach and general manager Bernie Bickerstaff had the 10th pick in the NBA draft. Instead of taking a flyer on Bryant, a 17-year-old wunderkind out of Philly, Bickerstaff traded down \\u2014 for Mark Jackson, Ricky Pierce and the No. 23 pick. Denver drafted Efthimios Rentzias.\\n\\nKobe was plucked with the 13th pick by Charlotte and, eventually, dealt to the Lakers. You know the rest.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2003, a 19-year-old woman in the mountain town of Edwards, Colo., accused the then-24-year-old Bryant of raping her after the NBA icon had flown in for knee surgery. Kobe was charged with sexual assault and false imprisonment. The criminal case was dropped when the woman refused to testify. A civil suit was settled.

His twin brother, Horace, had been a teammate of Bryant\\u2019s at the end of his career and a teammate of Michael Jordan\\u2019s at the start.\\n\\n\\u201cHe was like, \\u2018You\\u2019ve got Michael (here),\\u2019\\u201d Harvey said, raising his left hand and turning his palm flat.

Nobody could stop it.\\n\\n\\u201cHe had that persona on the court, that he was \\u2018The Black Mamba,\\u2019\\u201d Grant continued. \\u201cBut off the court, he was awesome \\u2026 he was a jokester. Let\\u2019s say if he scored 40 one night and you play against him the next night, he\\u2019s like (whispering), \\u2018You know, I got 40. So I\\u2019m gonna get 40 tonight.\\u2019 Stuff like that.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJust like Russell Westbrook, you knew what you were going to get from him,\\u201d Grant said. \\u201cHe never cheated the game. That\\u2019s why he lasted so long.\\u201d\\n\\nKobe transcended sports, a one-word idol in the mold of Tiger and Ali.

How to define that word commonly provokes one of those scholarly debates that\\u2019s so envenomed because the stakes are so small. Some scholars of martial affairs insist that a decisive battle must lead directly to peace in fairly short order. It must decide the outcome of the war as a whole in order to qualify.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s a mighty constricted definition. To its purveyors we might say, with Coach Lee Corso\\u2014this being college football season\\u2014not so fast, my friend! And hazard a contrary view, as Corso does when picking winners and losers on game day.\\n\\nThe classics of strategy divulge no concrete definition. Carl von Clausewitz comes closest in On War, stating vaguely that a great battle constitutes \\u201ca decisive factor in the outcome of a war or campaign\\u201d (my italics). Midway didn\\u2019t decide the outcome of World War II in the narrow sense. It did decide whether the IJN could annihilate the U.S. Pacific Fleet before it could rebuild, and it did decide the fate of Japan\\u2019s effort to rig a \\u201cribbon defense,\\u201d or defensive rampart, stretching from northerly island strongholds in the Aleutians through Midway at the ribbon\\u2019s midpoint through fastnesses farther south.\\n\\nAnd it did decide whether Tokyo would accomplish the goals for which it went to war. Answer on all counts: no. Midway reversed the flow of war in the Pacific from east to west, and operations kept flowing westerly until ultimate Allied victory in 1945. Sounds decisive to me\\u2014much as Trafalgar decided who would rule the sea during the Napoleonic Wars. Nelson\\u2019s clean sweep may not have led directly or speedily to peace, but it was a crucial enabler. It was a factor indispensable to the eventual outcome, even though the little emperor didn\\u2019t meet his Waterloo for another decade.\\n\\nAnd opportunism\\u2014in particular the opportunism of Rear Admiral Raymond J. Spruance, the commander of Task Force 16, built around the flattops USS Enterprise and Hornet\\u2014helped the U.S. Navy reap the fruits of decisive battle. According to Samuel Eliot Morison, the dean of World War II naval historians, Spruance displayed \\u201cthe very highest quality of tactical wisdom, the power to seize opportunities.\\u201d And although Spruance was a surface-ship officer in charge of naval aviation assets, he had the spine to overrule professional aviators when circumstances warranted.\\n\\nPacific Fleet boss Admiral Chester Nimitz afforded Spruance and Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher\\u2014who headed up Task Force 17, centered on the carrier Yorktown, and was assigned overall tactical command\\u2014ample leeway to shape their high-seas fate. Nimitz instructed them to conduct themselves by \\u201cthe principle of calculated risk\\u201d at Midway. By that he meant avoiding \\u201cexposure of your force to attack by superior enemy forces without good prospect of inflicting . . . greater damage on the enemy.\\u201d\\n\\nHis directive made strategic sense. Both combatants had committed all of their deployable fleet carriers to action at Midway. The IJN enjoyed a 4-3 numerical edge, yet it was Nimitz who had the luxury of risking his carriers. They were replaceable where Japan\\u2019s were not. Nimitz presided over a remnant of the prewar Pacific Fleet. He knew that a bigger, better U.S. Navy\\u2014including a brand-new class of fleet carriers, the Essex class\\u2014was building in shipyards back home and would make its way to the Pacific Ocean starting in 1943. With only a fraction of American industrial capacity, Japan could scarcely regenerate naval strength depleted in action. America could redeem its losses and then some; Japan would struggle to sustain itself.\\n\\nIf you have a spare weapon in the armory\\u2014or soon will\\u2014you may as well risk the one you have.\\n\\nAdmiral Spruance wielded Task Force 16 to good effect. Around daybreak on June 4 a Midway-based patrol plane reported sighting two IJN carriers steaming southeast toward the island. The American fleet had taken station to Midway\\u2019s northeast in hopes of mounting an ambush from an unexpected quarter, so Admiral Fletcher ordered Spruance to take Enterprise, Hornet, and their cohort southwest to intercept the foe. Spruance and his chief of staff, Captain Miles Browning, rightly surmised that Admiral Ch\\u016bichi Nagumo, the Kid\\u014d Butai\\u00ad\\u00ad commander, meant to bombard Midway and its U.S. Marine garrison.\\n\\nThey also suspected that Nagumo assumed no U.S. carriers would be in the vicinity. After all, a diversionary force had staged attacks in the Aleutian Islands, and top IJN commanders believed Nimitz would have dispatched the Pacific Fleet to intervene. Nagumo, then, was conflicted when scout planes reported the presence of U.S. carriers: should he rearm the Kid\\u014d Butai\\u00ad\\u00ad\\u2019s warplanes with torpedoes to assail enemy shipping, or keep loading them with bombs to execute subsequent raids against Midway?\\n\\nSpruance and Browning timed their launches to coincide with times of maximum flux in the Japanese fleet\\u2019s recovery and launch cycle\\u2014and to exploit Nagumo\\u2019s indecision. Carrier crews trying to refuel and arm warplanes are busy with other duties than self-defense. They\\u2019re also handling explosives and flammable liquids in parts of the ship vulnerable to bomb blasts.\\n\\nFor all that, the American air attacks were no masterpiece of massing firepower at the decisive place and time for mass impact. In mid-morning Hornet and Enterprise torpedo-bombers went in low, and broke themselves against the curtain of IJN anti-aircraft fire as well as Zeke fighters swooping overhead. While Japanese defenders concentrated their energies down low, Enterprise and then Yorktown dive-bombers arrived overhead. They pounced on the enemy flattops from high altitude, setting three of four ablaze within six minutes. Hiryu, the lone undamaged carrier, struck back successfully at Yorktown\\u2014only to be dispatched itself late that afternoon.\\n\\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy thus lost four of the Kid\\u014d Butai\\u00ad\\u00ad\\u2019s four fleet carriers in a day (two others damaged previously remained at home under repair and would return to action later in the war), to one of three for the U.S. Navy. Providence favored the U.S. Navy, and the leadership put its gift to good use.\\n\\nTempering his respect for technical specialists, in particular career airmen, comprised part of Ray Spruance\\u2019s entrepreneurship. For a time on the morning of June 4 he deferred to the wishes of Captain Browning, only to overrule him when the threat of Japanese air attacks loomed. Doctrine in those days called on air groups to stage a \\u201cdeferred departure\\u201d from the carrier. All squadrons would launch, gather overhead, and then proceed on their route en masse. In the process the first aircraft to launch would orbit overhead\\u2014and waste precious fuel while the rest of the group assembled.\\n\\nThe Hornet air wing conducted a deferred departure on the morning of June 4 at Browning\\u2019s direction. When the staff radio intelligence officer reported intercepting a Japanese scout plane\\u2019s transmission reporting the task force\\u2019s whereabouts, however, Spruance decided that, as Craig Symonds puts it, \\u201cenough was enough.\\u201d He had the flagship signal to Enterprise dive-bomber squadrons circling overhead: \\u201cproceed on mission assigned.\\u201d In other words, do not dawdle. Get aloft and proceed along your way. Spruance overrode procedures. That\\u2019s why the air wings attacked in fragmentary fashion\\u2014a drawback in combat\\u2014but it helped the bomber squadrons conserve fuel they would need to search out and attack the Japanese flattops. \\u201cIt was the right decision,\\u201d affirms Symonds, even though it cost the Americans in terms of coordinated action.\", \"author\": \"James Holmes\", \"url\": \"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/photo-how-empire-died-and-how-us-navy-crushed-japan-117336\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 05:45 EST\", \"published_utc\": 1580121900, \"collection_utc\": 1580128945}",News,1580121900

It did decide whether the IJN could annihilate the U.S. Pacific Fleet before it could rebuild, and it did decide the fate of Japan\\u2019s effort to rig a \\u201cribbon defense,\\u201d or defensive rampart, stretching from northerly island strongholds in the Aleutians through Midway at the ribbon\\u2019s midpoint through fastnesses farther south.\\n\\nAnd it did decide whether Tokyo would accomplish the goals for which it went to war. Answer on all counts: no. Midway reversed the flow of war in the Pacific from east to west, and operations kept flowing westerly until ultimate Allied victory in 1945.

Spruance, the commander of Task Force 16, built around the flattops USS Enterprise and Hornet\\u2014helped the U.S. Navy reap the fruits of decisive battle. According to Samuel Eliot Morison, the dean of World War II naval historians, Spruance displayed \\u201cthe very highest quality of tactical wisdom, the power to seize opportunities.\\u201d And although Spruance was a surface-ship officer in charge of naval aviation assets, he had the spine to overrule professional aviators when circumstances warranted.\\n\\nPacific Fleet boss Admiral Chester Nimitz afforded Spruance and Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher\\u2014who headed up Task Force 17, centered on the carrier Yorktown, and was assigned overall tactical command\\u2014ample leeway to shape their high-seas fate. Nimitz instructed them to conduct themselves by \\u201cthe principle of calculated risk\\u201d at Midway. By that he meant avoiding \\u201cexposure of your force to attack by superior enemy forces without good prospect of inflicting . . . greater damage on the enemy.\\u201d\\n\\nHis directive made strategic sense. Both combatants had committed all of their deployable fleet carriers to action at Midway. The IJN enjoyed a 4-3 numerical edge, yet it was Nimitz who had the luxury of risking his carriers. They were replaceable where Japan\\u2019s were not. Nimitz presided over a remnant of the prewar Pacific Fleet. He knew that a bigger, better U.S. Navy\\u2014including a brand-new class of fleet carriers, the Essex class\\u2014was building in shipyards back home and would make its way to the Pacific Ocean starting in 1943. With only a fraction of American industrial capacity, Japan could scarcely regenerate naval strength depleted in action. America could redeem its losses and then some; Japan would struggle to sustain itself.\\n\\nIf you have a spare weapon in the armory\\u2014or soon will\\u2014you may as well risk the one you have.\\n\\nAdmiral Spruance wielded Task Force 16 to good effect. Around daybreak on June 4 a Midway-based patrol plane reported sighting two IJN carriers steaming southeast toward the island. The American fleet had taken station to Midway\\u2019s northeast in hopes of mounting an ambush from an unexpected quarter, so Admiral Fletcher ordered Spruance to take Enterprise, Hornet, and their cohort southwest to intercept the foe. Spruance and his chief of staff, Captain Miles Browning, rightly surmised that Admiral Ch\\u016bichi Nagumo, the Kid\\u014d Butai\\u00ad\\u00ad commander, meant to bombard Midway and its U.S. Marine garrison.\\n\\nThey also suspected that Nagumo assumed no U.S. carriers would be in the vicinity. After all, a diversionary force had staged attacks in the Aleutian Islands, and top IJN commanders believed Nimitz would have dispatched the Pacific Fleet to intervene. Nagumo, then, was conflicted when scout planes reported the presence of U.S. carriers: should he rearm the Kid\\u014d Butai\\u00ad\\u00ad\\u2019s warplanes with torpedoes to assail enemy shipping, or keep loading them with bombs to execute subsequent raids against Midway?\\n\\nSpruance and Browning timed their launches to coincide with times of maximum flux in the Japanese fleet\\u2019s recovery and launch cycle\\u2014and to exploit Nagumo\\u2019s indecision. Carrier crews trying to refuel and arm warplanes are busy with other duties than self-defense. They\\u2019re also handling explosives and flammable liquids in parts of the ship vulnerable to bomb blasts.\\n\\nFor all that, the American air attacks were no masterpiece of massing firepower at the decisive place and time for mass impact. In mid-morning Hornet and Enterprise torpedo-bombers went in low, and broke themselves against the curtain of IJN anti-aircraft fire as well as Zeke fighters swooping overhead. While Japanese defenders concentrated their energies down low, Enterprise and then Yorktown dive-bombers arrived overhead. They pounced on the enemy flattops from high altitude, setting three of four ablaze within six minutes. Hiryu, the lone undamaged carrier, struck back successfully at Yorktown\\u2014only to be dispatched itself late that afternoon.\\n\\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy thus lost four of the Kid\\u014d Butai\\u00ad\\u00ad\\u2019s four fleet carriers in a day (two others damaged previously remained at home under repair and would return to action later in the war), to one of three for the U.S. Navy.

Spruance, the commander of Task Force 16, built around the flattops USS Enterprise and Hornet\\u2014helped the U.S. Navy reap the fruits of decisive battle. According to Samuel Eliot Morison, the dean of World War II naval historians, Spruance displayed \\u201cthe very highest quality of tactical wisdom, the power to seize opportunities.\\u201d And although Spruance was a surface-ship officer in charge of naval aviation assets, he had the spine to overrule professional aviators when circumstances warranted.\\n\\nPacific Fleet boss Admiral Chester Nimitz afforded Spruance and Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher\\u2014who headed up Task Force 17, centered on the carrier Yorktown, and was assigned overall tactical command\\u2014ample leeway to shape their high-seas fate. Nimitz instructed them to conduct themselves by \\u201cthe principle of calculated risk\\u201d at Midway. By that he meant avoiding \\u201cexposure of your force to attack by superior enemy forces without good prospect of inflicting . . . greater damage on the enemy.\\u201d\\n\\nHis directive made strategic sense. Both combatants had committed all of their deployable fleet carriers to action at Midway. The IJN enjoyed a 4-3 numerical edge, yet it was Nimitz who had the luxury of risking his carriers. They were replaceable where Japan\\u2019s were not. Nimitz presided over a remnant of the prewar Pacific Fleet. He knew that a bigger, better U.S. Navy\\u2014including a brand-new class of fleet carriers, the Essex class\\u2014was building in shipyards back home and would make its way to the Pacific Ocean starting in 1943. With only a fraction of American industrial capacity, Japan could scarcely regenerate naval strength depleted in action. America could redeem its losses and then some; Japan would struggle to sustain itself.\\n\\nIf you have a spare weapon in the armory\\u2014or soon will\\u2014you may as well risk the one you have.\\n\\nAdmiral Spruance wielded Task Force 16 to good effect. Around daybreak on June 4 a Midway-based patrol plane reported sighting two IJN carriers steaming southeast toward the island. The American fleet had taken station to Midway\\u2019s northeast in hopes of mounting an ambush from an unexpected quarter, so Admiral Fletcher ordered Spruance to take Enterprise, Hornet, and their cohort southwest to intercept the foe. Spruance and his chief of staff, Captain Miles Browning, rightly surmised that Admiral Ch\\u016bichi Nagumo, the Kid\\u014d Butai\\u00ad\\u00ad commander, meant to bombard Midway and its U.S. Marine garrison.\\n\\nThey also suspected that Nagumo assumed no U.S. carriers would be in the vicinity. After all, a diversionary force had staged attacks in the Aleutian Islands, and top IJN commanders believed Nimitz would have dispatched the Pacific Fleet to intervene. Nagumo, then, was conflicted when scout planes reported the presence of U.S. carriers: should he rearm the Kid\\u014d Butai\\u00ad\\u00ad\\u2019s warplanes with torpedoes to assail enemy shipping, or keep loading them with bombs to execute subsequent raids against Midway?\\n\\nSpruance and Browning timed their launches to coincide with times of maximum flux in the Japanese fleet\\u2019s recovery and launch cycle\\u2014and to exploit Nagumo\\u2019s indecision. Carrier crews trying to refuel and arm warplanes are busy with other duties than self-defense. They\\u2019re also handling explosives and flammable liquids in parts of the ship vulnerable to bomb blasts.\\n\\nFor all that, the American air attacks were no masterpiece of massing firepower at the decisive place and time for mass impact. In mid-morning Hornet and Enterprise torpedo-bombers went in low, and broke themselves against the curtain of IJN anti-aircraft fire as well as Zeke fighters swooping overhead. While Japanese defenders concentrated their energies down low, Enterprise and then Yorktown dive-bombers arrived overhead. They pounced on the enemy flattops from high altitude, setting three of four ablaze within six minutes. Hiryu, the lone undamaged carrier, struck back successfully at Yorktown\\u2014only to be dispatched itself late that afternoon.\\n\\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy thus lost four of the Kid\\u014d Butai\\u00ad\\u00ad\\u2019s four fleet carriers in a day (two others damaged previously remained at home under repair and would return to action later in the war), to one of three for the U.S. Navy.

Midway didn\\u2019t decide the outcome of World War II in the narrow sense. It did decide whether the IJN could annihilate the U.S. Pacific Fleet before it could rebuild, and it did decide the fate of Japan\\u2019s effort to rig a \\u201cribbon defense,\\u201d or defensive rampart, stretching from northerly island strongholds in the Aleutians through Midway at the ribbon\\u2019s midpoint through fastnesses farther south.\\n\\nAnd it did decide whether Tokyo would accomplish the goals for which it went to war.

Spruance, the commander of Task Force 16, built around the flattops USS Enterprise and Hornet\\u2014helped the U.S. Navy reap the fruits of decisive battle. According to Samuel Eliot Morison, the dean of World War II naval historians, Spruance displayed \\u201cthe very highest quality of tactical wisdom, the power to seize opportunities.\\u201d And although Spruance was a surface-ship officer in charge of naval aviation assets, he had the spine to overrule professional aviators when circumstances warranted.\\n\\nPacific Fleet boss Admiral Chester Nimitz afforded Spruance and Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher\\u2014who headed up Task Force 17, centered on the carrier Yorktown, and was assigned overall tactical command\\u2014ample leeway to shape their high-seas fate. Nimitz instructed them to conduct themselves by \\u201cthe principle of calculated risk\\u201d at Midway.

Both combatants had committed all of their deployable fleet carriers to action at Midway. The IJN enjoyed a 4-3 numerical edge, yet it was Nimitz who had the luxury of risking his carriers. They were replaceable where Japan\\u2019s were not. Nimitz presided over a remnant of the prewar Pacific Fleet. He knew that a bigger, better U.S. Navy\\u2014including a brand-new class of fleet carriers, the Essex class\\u2014was building in shipyards back home and would make its way to the Pacific Ocean starting in 1943. With only a fraction of American industrial capacity, Japan could scarcely regenerate naval strength depleted in action.

Around daybreak on June 4 a Midway-based patrol plane reported sighting two IJN carriers steaming southeast toward the island. The American fleet had taken station to Midway\\u2019s northeast in hopes of mounting an ambush from an unexpected quarter, so Admiral Fletcher ordered Spruance to take Enterprise, Hornet, and their cohort southwest to intercept the foe. Spruance and his chief of staff, Captain Miles Browning, rightly surmised that Admiral Ch\\u016bichi Nagumo, the Kid\\u014d Butai\\u00ad\\u00ad commander, meant to bombard Midway and its U.S. Marine garrison.\\n\\nThey also suspected that Nagumo assumed no U.S. carriers would be in the vicinity. After all, a diversionary force had staged attacks in the Aleutian Islands, and top IJN commanders believed Nimitz would have dispatched the Pacific Fleet to intervene. Nagumo, then, was conflicted when scout planes reported the presence of U.S. carriers: should he rearm the Kid\\u014d Butai\\u00ad\\u00ad\\u2019s warplanes with torpedoes to assail enemy shipping, or keep loading them with bombs to execute subsequent raids against Midway?\\n\\nSpruance and Browning timed their launches to coincide with times of maximum flux in the Japanese fleet\\u2019s recovery and launch cycle\\u2014and to exploit Nagumo\\u2019s indecision. Carrier crews trying to refuel and arm warplanes are busy with other duties than self-defense. They\\u2019re also handling explosives and flammable liquids in parts of the ship vulnerable to bomb blasts.\\n\\nFor all that, the American air attacks were no masterpiece of massing firepower at the decisive place and time for mass impact. In mid-morning Hornet and Enterprise torpedo-bombers went in low, and broke themselves against the curtain of IJN anti-aircraft fire as well as Zeke fighters swooping overhead. While Japanese defenders concentrated their energies down low, Enterprise and then Yorktown dive-bombers arrived overhead. They pounced on the enemy flattops from high altitude, setting three of four ablaze within six minutes. Hiryu, the lone undamaged carrier, struck back successfully at Yorktown\\u2014only to be dispatched itself late that afternoon.\\n\\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy thus lost four of the Kid\\u014d Butai\\u00ad\\u00ad\\u2019s four fleet carriers in a day (two others damaged previously remained at home under repair and would return to action later in the war), to one of three for the U.S. Navy.

As a rule, in fact, Bismarck was downright grim. He glowers at us from eternity. Once in awhile, though, the Iron Chancellor came out with a jest worthy of the great Yogi Berra\\u2014as when he reputedly proclaimed that Providence smiles on \\u201cfools, drunkards, and the United States of America.\\u201d Foolish besotted \\u2018Mercans must be triply blessed.\\n\\nYet Providence seldom does it all. It furnishes opportunity perchance. Individuals must grab and exploit opportunities fortune\\u2019s favor deigns to bestow on them.\\n\\nNever was this truer than June 1942, when U.S. Navy and Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) aircraft-carrier task forces met in battle off Midway Island, an atoll northwest of Hawaii. Hollywood essays a rare look at naval history this weekend with the release of director Roland Emmerich\\u2019s Midway, the first cinematic account of this epic clash since the 1970s. Not having seen the film yet, I can neither praise its wholesome goodness nor damn its failings.\\n\\nThere remains plenty to say about the encounter, regardless of how well Hollywood did its work. Fortune granted the USA its favor at Midway, as Bismarck might have prophesied. But it was sound doctrine and strategy, entrepreneurship among naval aviators, and shrewd senior leadership that positioned the U.S. Pacific Fleet to harvest the opportunities placed before it. And harvest them the navy did. By the time the guns, bombs, and torpedoes fell silent the Kid\\u014d Butai\\u00ad\\u00ad\\u2014the carrier striking fleet that had pounded Pearl Harbor six months before\\u2014adorned the Pacific seafloor.\\n\\nHistorian Craig Symonds pronounces Midway \\u201cthe most complete naval victory\\u201d since 1805, when Lord Horatio Nelson\\u2019s Royal Navy swept the combined French and Spanish fleets from the briny main at Trafalgar. Was it a \\u201cdecisive\\u201d victory as well as complete? Opinions vary. How to define that word commonly provokes one of those scholarly debates that\\u2019s so envenomed because the stakes are so small. Some scholars of martial affairs insist that a decisive battle must lead directly to peace in fairly short order. It must decide the outcome of the war as a whole in order to qualify.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s a mighty constricted definition. To its purveyors we might say, with Coach Lee Corso\\u2014this being college football season\\u2014not so fast, my friend! And hazard a contrary view, as Corso does when picking winners and losers on game day.\\n\\nThe classics of strategy divulge no concrete definition. Carl von Clausewitz comes closest in On War, stating vaguely that a great battle constitutes \\u201ca decisive factor in the outcome of a war or campaign\\u201d (my italics). Midway didn\\u2019t decide the outcome of World War II in the narrow sense. It did decide whether the IJN could annihilate the U.S. Pacific Fleet before it could rebuild, and it did decide the fate of Japan\\u2019s effort to rig a \\u201cribbon defense,\\u201d or defensive rampart, stretching from northerly island strongholds in the Aleutians through Midway at the ribbon\\u2019s midpoint through fastnesses farther south.\\n\\nAnd it did decide whether Tokyo would accomplish the goals for which it went to war. Answer on all counts: no. Midway reversed the flow of war in the Pacific from east to west, and operations kept flowing westerly until ultimate Allied victory in 1945. Sounds decisive to me\\u2014much as Trafalgar decided who would rule the sea during the Napoleonic Wars. Nelson\\u2019s clean sweep may not have led directly or speedily to peace, but it was a crucial enabler. It was a factor indispensable to the eventual outcome, even though the little emperor didn\\u2019t meet his Waterloo for another decade.\\n\\nAnd opportunism\\u2014in particular the opportunism of Rear Admiral Raymond J. Spruance, the commander of Task Force 16, built around the flattops USS Enterprise and Hornet\\u2014helped the U.S. Navy reap the fruits of decisive battle. According to Samuel Eliot Morison, the dean of World War II naval historians, Spruance displayed \\u201cthe very highest quality of tactical wisdom, the power to seize opportunities.\\u201d And although Spruance was a surface-ship officer in charge of naval aviation assets, he had the spine to overrule professional aviators when circumstances warranted.\\n\\nPacific Fleet boss Admiral Chester Nimitz afforded Spruance and Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher\\u2014who headed up Task Force 17, centered on the carrier Yorktown, and was assigned overall tactical command\\u2014ample leeway to shape their high-seas fate. Nimitz instructed them to conduct themselves by \\u201cthe principle of calculated risk\\u201d at Midway. By that he meant avoiding \\u201cexposure of your force to attack by superior enemy forces without good prospect of inflicting . . . greater damage on the enemy.\\u201d\\n\\nHis directive made strategic sense. Both combatants had committed all of their deployable fleet carriers to action at Midway. The IJN enjoyed a 4-3 numerical edge, yet it was Nimitz who had the luxury of risking his carriers. They were replaceable where Japan\\u2019s were not. Nimitz presided over a remnant of the prewar Pacific Fleet. He knew that a bigger, better U.S. Navy\\u2014including a brand-new class of fleet carriers, the Essex class\\u2014was building in shipyards back home and would make its way to the Pacific Ocean starting in 1943. With only a fraction of American industrial capacity, Japan could scarcely regenerate naval strength depleted in action. America could redeem its losses and then some; Japan would struggle to sustain itself.\\n\\nIf you have a spare weapon in the armory\\u2014or soon will\\u2014you may as well risk the one you have.\\n\\nAdmiral Spruance wielded Task Force 16 to good effect. Around daybreak on June 4 a Midway-based patrol plane reported sighting two IJN carriers steaming southeast toward the island. The American fleet had taken station to Midway\\u2019s northeast in hopes of mounting an ambush from an unexpected quarter, so Admiral Fletcher ordered Spruance to take Enterprise, Hornet, and their cohort southwest to intercept the foe. Spruance and his chief of staff, Captain Miles Browning, rightly surmised that Admiral Ch\\u016bichi Nagumo, the Kid\\u014d Butai\\u00ad\\u00ad commander, meant to bombard Midway and its U.S. Marine garrison.\\n\\nThey also suspected that Nagumo assumed no U.S. carriers would be in the vicinity. After all, a diversionary force had staged attacks in the Aleutian Islands, and top IJN commanders believed Nimitz would have dispatched the Pacific Fleet to intervene. Nagumo, then, was conflicted when scout planes reported the presence of U.S. carriers: should he rearm the Kid\\u014d Butai\\u00ad\\u00ad\\u2019s warplanes with torpedoes to assail enemy shipping, or keep loading them with bombs to execute subsequent raids against Midway?\\n\\nSpruance and Browning timed their launches to coincide with times of maximum flux in the Japanese fleet\\u2019s recovery and launch cycle\\u2014and to exploit Nagumo\\u2019s indecision. Carrier crews trying to refuel and arm warplanes are busy with other duties than self-defense. They\\u2019re also handling explosives and flammable liquids in parts of the ship vulnerable to bomb blasts.\\n\\nFor all that, the American air attacks were no masterpiece of massing firepower at the decisive place and time for mass impact. In mid-morning Hornet and Enterprise torpedo-bombers went in low, and broke themselves against the curtain of IJN anti-aircraft fire as well as Zeke fighters swooping overhead. While Japanese defenders concentrated their energies down low, Enterprise and then Yorktown dive-bombers arrived overhead. They pounced on the enemy flattops from high altitude, setting three of four ablaze within six minutes. Hiryu, the lone undamaged carrier, struck back successfully at Yorktown\\u2014only to be dispatched itself late that afternoon.\\n\\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy thus lost four of the Kid\\u014d Butai\\u00ad\\u00ad\\u2019s four fleet carriers in a day (two others damaged previously remained at home under repair and would return to action later in the war), to one of three for the U.S. Navy. Providence favored the U.S. Navy, and the leadership put its gift to good use.\\n\\nTempering his respect for technical specialists, in particular career airmen, comprised part of Ray Spruance\\u2019s entrepreneurship. For a time on the morning of June 4 he deferred to the wishes of Captain Browning, only to overrule him when the threat of Japanese air attacks loomed. Doctrine in those days called on air groups to stage a \\u201cdeferred departure\\u201d from the carrier. All squadrons would launch, gather overhead, and then proceed on their route en masse. In the process the first aircraft to launch would orbit overhead\\u2014and waste precious fuel while the rest of the group assembled.\\n\\nThe Hornet air wing conducted a deferred departure on the morning of June 4 at Browning\\u2019s direction. When the staff radio intelligence officer reported intercepting a Japanese scout plane\\u2019s transmission reporting the task force\\u2019s whereabouts, however, Spruance decided that, as Craig Symonds puts it, \\u201cenough was enough.\\u201d He had the flagship signal to Enterprise dive-bomber squadrons circling overhead: \\u201cproceed on mission assigned.\\u201d In other words, do not dawdle. Get aloft and proceed along your way. Spruance overrode procedures. That\\u2019s why the air wings attacked in fragmentary fashion\\u2014a drawback in combat\\u2014but it helped the bomber squadrons conserve fuel they would need to search out and attack the Japanese flattops. \\u201cIt was the right decision,\\u201d affirms Symonds, even though it cost the Americans in terms of coordinated action.\", \"author\": \"James Holmes\", \"url\": \"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/photo-how-empire-died-and-how-us-navy-crushed-japan-117336\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 05:45 EST\", \"published_utc\": 1580121900, \"collection_utc\": 1580128945}",News,1580121900

He has already reduced parliamentary scrutiny of the next phase, and his government has given only clues as to what the goals and red lines in negotiations will be.\\n\\nNegotiating mandates setting out wishlists and red lines are usually published by both sides before they enter into trade talks.
