CrisisFACTS-010-News-0-0,CrisisFACTS-010,the global trust crisis as the worlds political and business elites ruminate on world affairs at the swiss ski resort of davos this year they must contend with grave public discontent with the global system,"{\"id\": \"foreignpolicy--2020-01-22--The Global Trust Crisis\", \"date\": \"2020-01-22\", \"source\": \"foreignpolicy\", \"title\": \"The Global Trust Crisis\", \"content\": \"As the world\\u2019s political and business elites ruminate on world affairs at the Swiss ski resort of Davos, this year they must contend with grave public discontent with the global system. In recent months, protests have multiplied across the globe: self-determination riots in Catalonia and Hong Kong; rebellions fueled by inequality and corruption in Algeria, Chile, Ecuador, Egypt, and Sudan, to name just a few; and the climate-focused strikes around the world led by the activist Greta Thunberg.\\n\\nUnlike previous waves of protests such as the Arab Spring, which sought regime change as a central objective, the latest uprisings are calling for a fundamental change in the world\\u2019s systems of political and economic governance. Unless the leaders convening at Davos can formulate far-reaching reforms, the continued spread of populism, growing anti-capitalist sentiment, more trade wars, and many other dislocations are likely.\\n\\nWhy are so many people so disillusioned? There are four broad reasons, and they apply globally.\\n\\nThe Edelman report singles out the first cause: disillusionment with rising inequality and an increasingly insecure economic future. The majority of people in 21 out of 28 surveyed countries are worried about being left behind and \\u201closing the respect and dignity\\u201d they once enjoyed. Although economic growth and employment are robust in developed markets, trust is lagging because people feel that the benefits of prosperity are accruing to a narrow group of elites. Less than 1 in 3 people in developed markets believe that they will be better off in five years\\u2019 time, and 83 percent of workers are deeply concerned about losing their jobs due to factors such as automation, the gig economy, lack of training, cheaper foreign competition, and immigration.\\n\\nA second driver of mistrust is growing polarization between different segments of society. In India, for example, Muslims feel increasingly marginalized under the Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The country was recently rocked by days of violent protests after the government introduced a new citizenship law that discriminated against Muslim refugees from neighboring Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.\\n\\nIn the West, persistent gender inequity has mounted in the form of movements such as #MeToo and the annual Women\\u2019s March, which drew an estimated crowd of 3.3 million to 5.2 million participants across the United States in 2017\\u2014reportedly the largest protest in U.S. history. Meanwhile, the diverging economic fortunes of high-wage knowledge workers in densifying cities and blue-collar labor in deindustrializing rural areas have contributed to populist movements like Brexit and Trumpism.\\n\\nThird, public alarm about climate change, which is intrinsically linked to the world\\u2019s resource-intensive production model, appears to be escalating. Many people view the recurrent flooding in cities like Venice and Jakarta and the vast forest fires in Australia, the Amazon, and California as signs of what is to come. However, the public is becoming increasingly exasperated by the lack of a broader institutional response to the climate crisis, combined with statements like U.S. President Donald Trump branding climate change activists as \\u201cprophets of doom\\u201d and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison going on holiday during the country\\u2019s intensifying forest fires.\\n\\nFourth, many citizens of developed countries believe that international trade contributes to job losses and stagnating wages, as a host of manufacturing and tradeable service industries have migrated to lower-cost countries. Support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, almost halved among Republican voters between 2004 and 2017. In developing countries, trade has widened the inequality gap between workers employed in high-productivity traded sectors and those still engaged in the informal economy.\\n\\nThese four factors have converged into a Great Trust Crisis\\u2014a tinderbox of disaffection that could erupt with unpredictable consequences.\\n\\nFirst, to ensure economic security for the working population, government and business must come together\\u2014at venues like Davos\\u2014to develop innovative new approaches to make basic needs like housing, education, child care, and health care more accessible and affordable. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the real cost of medical care has more than doubled and college tuition almost quadrupled in the United States since 1980. The rising cost of basic social services creates a drag on household income and dampens overall economic growth. For example, without affordable child care, parents (especially women) find it more difficult to return to full-time work after giving birth and may drop out of the workforce altogether.\\n\\nGovernment and business must also collaborate to invest in the development of human capital and regional economies. Taking a cue from the flexicurity program in Denmark, in countries that invest in lifelong learning and job placement services, workers are more likely to secure well-paid jobs in high-growth, knowledge-intensive sectors. In parallel, efforts to transition to a greener economy also provide opportunities to revitalize rural areas through public and private investments into infrastructure and the green economy.\\n\\nMany policies designed to support economic security will also help fight social polarization. But to enable constructive political dialogue, the second pillar of the global system that must be held to higher standards is the media. For example, proposals have been put forward in the United Kingdom to place a fiduciary duty on social media and other digital information platforms to prevent the spread of fake news and harmful content.\\n\\nThird, more countries need make concrete steps to achieve a carbon neutral economy. The governments of the European Union are poised to show the way forward with their 10-point Green Deal to be released in March. The plan will target a 50-55 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. New directives are also expected on the accelerated deployment of renewable energy, energy efficiency initiatives, and emissions trading markets. Outside of Europe, China is aiming to introduce a carbon trading scheme in 2020, which will cover a quarter of global carbon dioxide emissions. And New York City is committed to having net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 under its OneNYC plan.\\n\\nFourth, governments must move beyond damaging trade disputes to reforming the model for international trade. In the recent \\u201cphase one\\u201d trade agreement between the United States and China, China\\u2019s commitment to purchase $200 billion in U.S. goods over the next two years only serves to temporarily redraw the balance between the two countries. The two superpowers have made few advances in key areas such as industrial subsidies, labor standards, intellectual property protection, digital trade, and environmental sustainability standards. In the absence of a new model of international trade, these unresolved issues will come to a head again and again. For example, as part of the EU\\u2019s Green Deal, proposals are also expected for a carbon border tax to protect green EU companies against unfair competition from other regions with less stringent environmental regulations.\\n\\nAs world leaders deliberate the future direction of the global economy in Davos, they would do well to heed the impatient public outcry for genuine systematic reform in the era of the Great Trust Crisis. If they don\\u2019t, they could be swept aside as pressure boils over into anti-establishment revolt.\", \"author\": \"Indranil Ghosh\", \"url\": \"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/22/davos-world-leader-trust-institutions-populism-protest/\", \"published\": \"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 19:24:49 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1579739089, \"collection_utc\": 1579796215}",News,1579739089

Meanwhile, the diverging economic fortunes of high-wage knowledge workers in densifying cities and blue-collar labor in deindustrializing rural areas have contributed to populist movements like Brexit and Trumpism.\\n\\nThird, public alarm about climate change, which is intrinsically linked to the world\\u2019s resource-intensive production model, appears to be escalating. Many people view the recurrent flooding in cities like Venice and Jakarta and the vast forest fires in Australia, the Amazon, and California as signs of what is to come. However, the public is becoming increasingly exasperated by the lack of a broader institutional response to the climate crisis, combined with statements like U.S. President Donald Trump branding climate change activists as \\u201cprophets of doom\\u201d and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison going on holiday during the country\\u2019s intensifying forest fires.\\n\\nFourth, many citizens of developed countries believe that international trade contributes to job losses and stagnating wages, as a host of manufacturing and tradeable service industries have migrated to lower-cost countries. Support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, almost halved among Republican voters between 2004 and 2017. In developing countries, trade has widened the inequality gap between workers employed in high-productivity traded sectors and those still engaged in the informal economy.\\n\\nThese four factors have converged into a Great Trust Crisis\\u2014a tinderbox of disaffection that could erupt with unpredictable consequences.\\n\\nFirst, to ensure economic security for the working population, government and business must come together\\u2014at venues like Davos\\u2014to develop innovative new approaches to make basic needs like housing, education, child care, and health care more accessible and affordable. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the real cost of medical care has more than doubled and college tuition almost quadrupled in the United States since 1980. The rising cost of basic social services creates a drag on household income and dampens overall economic growth. For example, without affordable child care, parents (especially women) find it more difficult to return to full-time work after giving birth and may drop out of the workforce altogether.\\n\\nGovernment and business must also collaborate to invest in the development of human capital and regional economies. Taking a cue from the flexicurity program in Denmark, in countries that invest in lifelong learning and job placement services, workers are more likely to secure well-paid jobs in high-growth, knowledge-intensive sectors. In parallel, efforts to transition to a greener economy also provide opportunities to revitalize rural areas through public and private investments into infrastructure and the green economy.\\n\\nMany policies designed to support economic security will also help fight social polarization. But to enable constructive political dialogue, the second pillar of the global system that must be held to higher standards is the media. For example, proposals have been put forward in the United Kingdom to place a fiduciary duty on social media and other digital information platforms to prevent the spread of fake news and harmful content.\\n\\nThird, more countries need make concrete steps to achieve a carbon neutral economy. The governments of the European Union are poised to show the way forward with their 10-point Green Deal to be released in March. The plan will target a 50-55 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. New directives are also expected on the accelerated deployment of renewable energy, energy efficiency initiatives, and emissions trading markets. Outside of Europe, China is aiming to introduce a carbon trading scheme in 2020, which will cover a quarter of global carbon dioxide emissions. And New York City is committed to having net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 under its OneNYC plan.\\n\\nFourth, governments must move beyond damaging trade disputes to reforming the model for international trade. In the recent \\u201cphase one\\u201d trade agreement between the United States and China, China\\u2019s commitment to purchase $200 billion in U.S. goods over the next two years only serves to temporarily redraw the balance between the two countries. The two superpowers have made few advances in key areas such as industrial subsidies, labor standards, intellectual property protection, digital trade, and environmental sustainability standards. In the absence of a new model of international trade, these unresolved issues will come to a head again and again. For example, as part of the EU\\u2019s Green Deal, proposals are also expected for a carbon border tax to protect green EU companies against unfair competition from other regions with less stringent environmental regulations.\\n\\nAs world leaders deliberate the future direction of the global economy in Davos, they would do well to heed the impatient public outcry for genuine systematic reform in the era of the Great Trust Crisis.

CrisisFACTS-010-News-0-9,CrisisFACTS-010,"less than 1 in 3 people in developed markets believe that they will be better off in five years time and 83 percent of workers are deeply concerned about losing their jobs due to factors such as automation the gig economy lack of training cheaper foreign competition and immigration","{\"id\": \"foreignpolicy--2020-01-22--The Global Trust Crisis\", \"date\": \"2020-01-22\", \"source\": \"foreignpolicy\", \"title\": \"The Global Trust Crisis\", \"content\": \"As the world\\u2019s political and business elites ruminate on world affairs at the Swiss ski resort of Davos, this year they must contend with grave public discontent with the global system. In recent months, protests have multiplied across the globe: self-determination riots in Catalonia and Hong Kong; rebellions fueled by inequality and corruption in Algeria, Chile, Ecuador, Egypt, and Sudan, to name just a few; and the climate-focused strikes around the world led by the activist Greta Thunberg.\\n\\nUnlike previous waves of protests such as the Arab Spring, which sought regime change as a central objective, the latest uprisings are calling for a fundamental change in the world\\u2019s systems of political and economic governance. Unless the leaders convening at Davos can formulate far-reaching reforms, the continued spread of populism, growing anti-capitalist sentiment, more trade wars, and many other dislocations are likely.\\n\\nWhy are so many people so disillusioned? There are four broad reasons, and they apply globally.\\n\\nThe Edelman report singles out the first cause: disillusionment with rising inequality and an increasingly insecure economic future. The majority of people in 21 out of 28 surveyed countries are worried about being left behind and \\u201closing the respect and dignity\\u201d they once enjoyed. Although economic growth and employment are robust in developed markets, trust is lagging because people feel that the benefits of prosperity are accruing to a narrow group of elites. Less than 1 in 3 people in developed markets believe that they will be better off in five years\\u2019 time, and 83 percent of workers are deeply concerned about losing their jobs due to factors such as automation, the gig economy, lack of training, cheaper foreign competition, and immigration.\\n\\nA second driver of mistrust is growing polarization between different segments of society. In India, for example, Muslims feel increasingly marginalized under the Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The country was recently rocked by days of violent protests after the government introduced a new citizenship law that discriminated against Muslim refugees from neighboring Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.\\n\\nIn the West, persistent gender inequity has mounted in the form of movements such as #MeToo and the annual Women\\u2019s March, which drew an estimated crowd of 3.3 million to 5.2 million participants across the United States in 2017\\u2014reportedly the largest protest in U.S. history. Meanwhile, the diverging economic fortunes of high-wage knowledge workers in densifying cities and blue-collar labor in deindustrializing rural areas have contributed to populist movements like Brexit and Trumpism.\\n\\nThird, public alarm about climate change, which is intrinsically linked to the world\\u2019s resource-intensive production model, appears to be escalating. Many people view the recurrent flooding in cities like Venice and Jakarta and the vast forest fires in Australia, the Amazon, and California as signs of what is to come. However, the public is becoming increasingly exasperated by the lack of a broader institutional response to the climate crisis, combined with statements like U.S. President Donald Trump branding climate change activists as \\u201cprophets of doom\\u201d and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison going on holiday during the country\\u2019s intensifying forest fires.\\n\\nFourth, many citizens of developed countries believe that international trade contributes to job losses and stagnating wages, as a host of manufacturing and tradeable service industries have migrated to lower-cost countries. Support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, almost halved among Republican voters between 2004 and 2017. In developing countries, trade has widened the inequality gap between workers employed in high-productivity traded sectors and those still engaged in the informal economy.\\n\\nThese four factors have converged into a Great Trust Crisis\\u2014a tinderbox of disaffection that could erupt with unpredictable consequences.\\n\\nFirst, to ensure economic security for the working population, government and business must come together\\u2014at venues like Davos\\u2014to develop innovative new approaches to make basic needs like housing, education, child care, and health care more accessible and affordable. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the real cost of medical care has more than doubled and college tuition almost quadrupled in the United States since 1980. The rising cost of basic social services creates a drag on household income and dampens overall economic growth. For example, without affordable child care, parents (especially women) find it more difficult to return to full-time work after giving birth and may drop out of the workforce altogether.\\n\\nGovernment and business must also collaborate to invest in the development of human capital and regional economies. Taking a cue from the flexicurity program in Denmark, in countries that invest in lifelong learning and job placement services, workers are more likely to secure well-paid jobs in high-growth, knowledge-intensive sectors. In parallel, efforts to transition to a greener economy also provide opportunities to revitalize rural areas through public and private investments into infrastructure and the green economy.\\n\\nMany policies designed to support economic security will also help fight social polarization. But to enable constructive political dialogue, the second pillar of the global system that must be held to higher standards is the media.

His inaugural address lamented that \\\"factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind.\\\" His campaign slogan, Make America Great Again, was at least in part a nostalgic appeal to an old economic model, in which manufacturing employment and output was a form of national greatness.\\n\\nBut although it is true that America's economy has, on the whole, performed admirably well under Trump, with unemployment numbers hovering near historic lows, one of the notable dark spots over the last year has been manufacturing jobs\\u2014particularly those in the upper midwest.\\n\\nLast week, the Federal Reserve reported that U.S. manufacturing was in a recession for all of 2019. This wasn't slow growth; the sector actually became smaller. The slowdown was relatively mild, with factory production shrinking by about 1.3 percent. But it was the worst performance since 2015, the year that Trump started his presidential campaign. Under Trump, the manufacturing economy has returned to the Obama era.\\n\\nManufacturers have a clear culprit in mind for the sector's poor performance. As The Washington Post notes in a report on the Federal Reserve data, the uncertainty and increased costs surrounding Trump's trade war, which was billed as a way of supporting American factory jobs, has instead wreaked havoc on an export-heavy sector that relies on the global flow of goods to operate. Trump's interventions were intended to prop up U.S. manufacturing. But they backfired, harming the people he claimed to help\\u2014who also happen to be some of the people who played a crucial part in his election.\\n\\nAnd while manufacturers did add jobs during the first two years of Trump's presidency, the largest share of those jobs weren't in the nation's old industrial heartland, but in the sunbelt and the West. In states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, manufacturing employment has fallen.\\n\\nAs Reuters reported last year, there were signs of serious manufacturing sector weakness in five of the six states that flipped from twice supporting President Obama to backing President Trump in 2016.\\n\\nNor are manufacturing jobs the only ones to be hit by trade costs and uncertainty. As a New York Times report notes, middle-wage job growth, which includes manufacturing as well as occupations like mining and construction, slowed considerably over 2019, dropping from 2.6 percent to 1.3 percent, owing to trade-war squabbling. \\\"That slowdown is driving the deceleration of job growth across the American economy,\\\" the report notes. Farming, another industry that Trump campaigned on helping, was so harmed by the trade war that the Trump administration ended up spending some $28 billion\\u2014more than double the price tag of President Obama's auto bailout\\u2014to keep them afloat.\\n\\nThere is an obvious lesson here, which is that, despite Trump's repeated insistence to the contrary, trade wars are neither good nor easy to win; they raise costs on American consumers and businesses; they add complexity and uncertainty, disrupting supply lines and business plans even when threatened tariffs don't go into effect. They have, in other words, exactly the predictable negative effects that economists have known of and warned about for years.\\n\\nBut there are also subtler lessons in the perils of sector-specific economic planning, and of expecting too much from a president. Trump's attempts to prop up the manufacturing sector through tariffs and trade restrictions didn't just fail to work; they actively harmed the people they were intended to help. So even as Trump has overseen an economy that has many bright spots, the sector and worker demographic he tried to boost ended up struggling.\\n\\nYou can, of course, chalk this up to Trump's ignorance on trade, or to being captured by hackish advisors who believe that protectionism is its own form of good.

The move is an attempt to contain the Wuhan coronavirus, which causes pneumonia and has spread with worrying speed. Buses, train, and flights out of the city will be canceled, and the city\\u2019s 11 million people have been told not to travel without special reason. The quarantine goes into effect as the Lunar New Year travel season kicks off, raising fears of contagion.\\n\\nThe scale of the virus, first reported on Dec. 31, is growing, as shown below. Today, Chinese official figures confirmed 544 cases and 17 deaths, and the numbers are rising daily. In China, that could be the tip of the iceberg: The virus appears to have a long incubation period\\u2014eight to 10 days\\u2014and has likely spread further.

Five other countries, including the United States, have reported cases\\u2014all individuals traveling from central China.\\n\\nHard decisions. As the number of cases climbs, the Wuhan government\\u2019s initial response has come under scrutiny.

That doesn\\u2019t mean that the Chinese government is lying now. It has at the very least acknowledged the crisis and threatened anyone who covers up new cases.\\n\\nFor the decision-makers at the top, weighing the need for control measures against the desire to avoid panic is tough. After the Wuhan quarantine, expect more restrictive steps in the next few days. For lower-level officials, the priority is avoiding blame\\u2014which at this point could mean implementing stronger measures at the local level, like travel restrictions. But if the Wuhan quarantine is extended to other cities during the Lunar New Year travel period, it is likely to cause widespread fear and disruption.\\n\\nCancel your trips. Until the situation is clearer, it\\u2019s probably not a good idea to travel to China. The primary worry here isn\\u2019t the virus itself; it\\u2019s that travel restrictions or quarantine could be imposed suddenly. During the H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009, some travelers were stranded for up to a week\\u2014and the Wuhan coronavirus looks more serious.\\n\\nFestival overshadowed. The Lunar New Year is on Jan. 25, so those lucky enough to get time off early are already on their way home. For young, urban Chinese, the holiday is often more of a chore than a celebration, between the hassle of travel, relatives\\u2019 interrogations, and working extra to compensate for time off. But for older people and migrant workers, the Lunar New Year is a rare chance to spend time with family\\u2014a joyous occasion marked by banquets, fireworks, and temple fairs.\\n\\nThe Wuhan coronavirus has cast a pall over that. Fireworks and public gatherings in cities have already been restricted in the last few years. Officials nervous about contagion may impose further limits, while fears of the virus could keep people indoors. Migrant workers, who could face an even harder time getting home than usual, will be the worst off, especially if they come from near Wuhan or have been working there.

The move is an attempt to contain the Wuhan coronavirus, which causes pneumonia and has spread with worrying speed. Buses, train, and flights out of the city will be canceled, and the city\\u2019s 11 million people have been told not to travel without special reason. The quarantine goes into effect as the Lunar New Year travel season kicks off, raising fears of contagion.\\n\\nThe scale of the virus, first reported on Dec. 31, is growing, as shown below. Today, Chinese official figures confirmed 544 cases and 17 deaths, and the numbers are rising daily. In China, that could be the tip of the iceberg: The virus appears to have a long incubation period\\u2014eight to 10 days\\u2014and has likely spread further. Several deaths from pneumonia appear to have gone officially uncounted, dismissed as the flu. Five other countries, including the United States, have reported cases\\u2014all individuals traveling from central China.\\n\\nHard decisions. As the number of cases climbs, the Wuhan government\\u2019s initial response has come under scrutiny. For nearly three weeks, fewer than 50 cases of the virus were reported\\u2014which now looks more like a cover-up similar to the reaction to SARS in 2002-2003. That doesn\\u2019t mean that the Chinese government is lying now. It has at the very least acknowledged the crisis and threatened anyone who covers up new cases.\\n\\nFor the decision-makers at the top, weighing the need for control measures against the desire to avoid panic is tough. After the Wuhan quarantine, expect more restrictive steps in the next few days. For lower-level officials, the priority is avoiding blame\\u2014which at this point could mean implementing stronger measures at the local level, like travel restrictions. But if the Wuhan quarantine is extended to other cities during the Lunar New Year travel period, it is likely to cause widespread fear and disruption.\\n\\nCancel your trips. Until the situation is clearer, it\\u2019s probably not a good idea to travel to China. The primary worry here isn\\u2019t the virus itself; it\\u2019s that travel restrictions or quarantine could be imposed suddenly. During the H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009, some travelers were stranded for up to a week\\u2014and the Wuhan coronavirus looks more serious.\\n\\nFestival overshadowed. The Lunar New Year is on Jan. 25, so those lucky enough to get time off early are already on their way home. For young, urban Chinese, the holiday is often more of a chore than a celebration, between the hassle of travel, relatives\\u2019 interrogations, and working extra to compensate for time off. But for older people and migrant workers, the Lunar New Year is a rare chance to spend time with family\\u2014a joyous occasion marked by banquets, fireworks, and temple fairs.\\n\\nThe Wuhan coronavirus has cast a pall over that. Fireworks and public gatherings in cities have already been restricted in the last few years. Officials nervous about contagion may impose further limits, while fears of the virus could keep people indoors. Migrant workers, who could face an even harder time getting home than usual, will be the worst off, especially if they come from near Wuhan or have been working there.

Almost one million were Jews.\\n\\nThose deported to the camp complex were gassed, starved, worked to death and even killed in medical experiments. The vast majority died in the Auschwitz II death camp - known as Auschwitz-Birkenau.\\n\\nSix million Jewish people died in the Holocaust - the Nazi campaign to eradicate Europe's Jewish population. Auschwitz was at the centre of that genocide.\\n\\nWhat was the Holocaust?\\n\\nWhen the Nazis came to power in 1933 they began to strip Jewish people of all property, freedoms and rights under the law. After the German invasion and occupation of Poland in 1939, the Nazis started deporting Jewish people from Germany and Austria to Poland, where they created ghettos to separate them from the rest of the population.\\n\\nIn 1941, during the German invasion of the USSR, the Nazis began their campaign of extermination in earnest. Nazis spoke about their invasion as a race war between Germany and Jewish people, as well as the Slavic population and the Roma.\\n\\nGroups of German soldiers called Einsatzgruppen set out across newly conquered lands in Eastern Europe to massacre civilians. By the end of 1941, they had killed 500,000 people, and by 1945 they had murdered about two million - 1.3 million of whom were Jewish.\\n\\nBehind the lines, Nazi commanders were experimenting with ways to kill en masse. They feared that shooting people was too stressful for their soldiers, and so came up with more efficient means of murder.\\n\\nExperimental gas vans had been used to kill mentally disabled people in Poland as early as 1939. Poisonous fumes were pumped into a sealed compartment to suffocate those inside. By the winter of 1941, the Nazis had constructed gas chambers at Auschwitz.\\n\\nNazi leaders met in January 1942 to coordinate the industrial slaughter. At the Wannsee Conference, as it became known, they agreed to what they called a \\\"final solution to the Jewish question\\\" - killing the entire European Jewish population, 11 million people, by extermination and forced labour.\\n\\nAuschwitz was originally a Polish army barracks in southern Poland. Nazi Germany invaded and occupied Poland in September 1939, and by May 1940 turned the site into a jail for political prisoners.\\n\\nThis area - with the infamous lie Arbeit Macht Frei written above the entrance in German - meaning work sets you free - became known as Auschwitz I.\\n\\nBut as the war and the Holocaust progressed, the Nazi regime greatly developed the site.\\n\\nThe first prisoners to be gassed were a group of Polish and Soviet prisoners in August 1941. Work began on a new camp, Auschwitz II-Birkenau, the following month. This became the site of the huge gas chambers where hundreds of thousands were murdered until November 1944, and the crematoria was where their bodies were burned.\\n\\nGerman chemicals company IG Farben built and operated a synthetic rubber factory at Auschwitz III-Monowitz. Other private companies like Krupp and Siemens-Schuckert also ran factories nearby, to use the prisoners as slave labour. Both Primo Levi and Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel survived Monowitz concentration camp.\\n\\nWhen Auschwitz was eventually liberated, it had more than 40 camps and subcamps.\\n\\nPeople from all over Europe were crammed into cattle wagons without windows, toilets, seats or food, and transported to Auschwitz.\\n\\nThere they were sorted into those who could work and those who were to be immediately killed.\\n\\nThe latter group were ordered to strip naked and sent to the showers for \\\"delousing\\\" - a euphemism used for the gas chambers.\\n\\nGuards from the so-called \\\"Hygienic Institute\\\" would then drop powerful Zyklon-B gas pellets into the sealed chambers, and wait for people to die. It took about 20 minutes. The thick walls could not hide the screams of those suffocating inside.\\n\\nThen Sonderkommandos - other prisoners, usually Jews forced to work for the guards or be killed - would remove artificial limbs, glasses, hair and teeth before dragging the corpses to the incinerators. Ashes of the bodies were buried or used as fertiliser.\\n\\nBelongings of those gassed and those sent to work were taken for sorting in a part of the camp known as \\\"Canada\\\" - so named because the country was seen as a land of plenty.\\n\\nWho were the victims?\\n\\nSS guards sought to hide their crimes as Soviet troops closed in, and tried to destroy their extensive prisoner records - making it hard to fully quantify the number of victims.\\n\\nAcademic studies since agree that in total close to 1.3 million people arrived at Auschwitz. About 1.1 million of them died there.\\n\\u2022 The Holocaust: Who are the missing million?\\n\\nJews from all across Nazi-controlled Europe made up the vast majority of the victims. Almost one million Jewish people were murdered at Auschwitz.\\n\\nOne specific example was Hungary's Jewish population. In the space of just two months, between May and July 1944, Hungary transported 420,000 Jewish people to Auschwitz.\\n\\nTens of thousands of Hungarian Jews were sent to Auschwitz every day. Three quarters of them were killed on arrival.\\n\\nSome 75,000 Polish civilians, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, 25,000 Roma and Sinti, as well as Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals and political prisoners were also put to death by the German state at the Auschwitz complex.\\n\\nWhat happened when Auschwitz was liberated?\\n\\nGerman authorities ordered a halt to gassing and the destruction of the gas chambers and crematoria in late 1944, as Soviet troops advanced westward. The stockpile of stolen valuables in the Canada sector was shipped to Germany shortly afterwards.\\n\\nDetermined to erase the evidence of their crimes, the Nazis ordered tens of thousands of remaining prisoners to march west to other concentration camps, such as Bergen-Belsen, Dachau and Sachsenhausen. Those too sick to walk were left behind; any who fell behind on the march itself were killed.\\n\\nSoviet forces found only a few thousand survivors when they entered the camp on 27 January 1945, along with hundreds of thousands of clothes and several tonnes of human hair. Soldiers later recalled having to convince some survivors that the Nazis had truly gone.\\n\\nElie Wiesel later said in a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of the liberation that the Nazi crimes at Auschwitz \\\"produced a mutation on a cosmic scale, affecting man's dreams and endeavours\\\".\\n\\n\\\"After Auschwitz, the human condition is no longer the same.

Almost one million were Jews.\\n\\nThose deported to the camp complex were gassed, starved, worked to death and even killed in medical experiments. The vast majority were murdered in the complex of gas chambers at Auschwitz II-Birkenau camp.\\n\\nSix million Jewish people died in the Holocaust - the Nazi campaign to eradicate Europe's Jewish population. Auschwitz was at the centre of that genocide.\\n\\nWhat was the Holocaust?\\n\\nWhen the Nazis came to power in 1933 they began to strip Jewish people of all property, freedoms and rights under the law. After the German invasion and occupation of Poland in 1939, the Nazis started deporting Jewish people from the Third Reich to parts of Poland, where they created ghettos to separate them from the rest of the population.\\n\\nIn 1941, during the German invasion of the USSR, the Nazis began their campaign of extermination in earnest. Nazis spoke about their invasion as a race war between Germany and Jewish people, as well as the Slavic population and the Roma.\\n\\nGroups of German soldiers called Einsatzgruppen set out across newly conquered lands in Eastern Europe to massacre civilians. By the end of 1941, they had killed 500,000 people, and by 1945 they had murdered about two million - 1.3 million of whom were Jewish.\\n\\nBehind the lines, Nazi commanders were experimenting with ways to kill en masse. They feared that shooting people was too stressful for their soldiers, and so came up with more efficient means of murder.\\n\\nExperimental gas vans had been used to kill mentally disabled people in Poland as early as 1939. Poisonous fumes were pumped into a sealed compartment to suffocate those inside. By the winter of 1941, the Nazis had constructed gas chambers at Auschwitz.\\n\\nNazi leaders met in January 1942 at the Wannsee Conference to coordinate the industrial slaughter - what they called a \\\"final solution to the Jewish question\\\" - killing the entire European Jewish population, 11 million people, by extermination and forced labour.\\n\\nAuschwitz was originally a Polish army barracks in southern Poland. Nazi Germany invaded and occupied Poland in September 1939, and by May 1940 turned the site into a jail for political prisoners.\\n\\nThis area - with the infamous lie Arbeit Macht Frei written above the entrance in German - meaning work sets you free - became known as Auschwitz I.\\n\\nBut as the war and the Holocaust progressed, the Nazi regime greatly developed the site.\\n\\nThe first people to be gassed were a group of Polish and Soviet prisoners in September 1941. Work began on a new camp, Auschwitz II-Birkenau, the following month. This became the site of the huge gas chambers where hundreds of thousands were murdered until November 1944, and the crematoria was where their bodies were burned.\\n\\nGerman chemicals company IG Farben built and operated a synthetic rubber factory at Auschwitz III-Monowitz. Other private companies like Krupp and Siemens-Schuckert also ran factories nearby, to use the prisoners as slave labour. Both Primo Levi and Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel survived Monowitz concentration camp.\\n\\nWhen Auschwitz was eventually liberated, it had more than 40 camps and subcamps.\\n\\nPeople from all over Europe were crammed into cattle wagons without windows, toilets, seats or food, and transported to Auschwitz.\\n\\nThere they were sorted into those who could work and those who were to be immediately killed.\\n\\nThe latter group were ordered to strip naked and sent to the showers for \\\"delousing\\\" - a euphemism used for the gas chambers.\\n\\nGuards from the so-called \\\"Hygienic Institute\\\" would then drop powerful Zyklon-B gas pellets into the sealed chambers, and wait for people to die. It took about 20 minutes. The thick walls could not hide the screams of those suffocating inside.\\n\\nThen Sonderkommandos - other prisoners, usually Jews forced to work for the guards or be killed - would remove artificial limbs, glasses, hair and teeth before dragging the corpses to the incinerators. Ashes of the bodies were buried or used as fertiliser.\\n\\nBelongings of those gassed and those sent to work were taken for sorting in a part of the camp known as \\\"Canada\\\" - so named because the country was seen as a land of plenty.\\n\\nWho were the victims?\\n\\nSS guards sought to hide their crimes as Soviet troops closed in, and tried to destroy their extensive prisoner records - making it hard to fully quantify the number of victims.\\n\\nAcademic studies since agree that in total close to 1.3 million people arrived at Auschwitz. About 1.1 million of them died there.\\n\\u2022 The Holocaust: Who are the missing million?\\n\\nJews from all across Nazi-controlled Europe made up the vast majority of the victims. Almost one million Jewish people were murdered at Auschwitz.\\n\\nOne specific example was Hungary's Jewish population. In the space of just two months, between May and July 1944, Hungary transported 420,000 of the 437,000 Jewish people it sent to Auschwitz.\\n\\nTens of thousands of Hungarian Jews were sent to Auschwitz every day. Three quarters of them were killed on arrival.\\n\\nSome 75,000 Polish civilians, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, 25,000 Roma and Sinti, as well as Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals and political prisoners were also put to death by the German state at the Auschwitz complex.\\n\\nWhat happened when Auschwitz was liberated?\\n\\nGerman authorities ordered a halt to gassing and the destruction of the gas chambers and crematoria in late 1944, as Soviet troops advanced westward.

CrisisFACTS-010-News-7-1,CrisisFACTS-010,here are the five most dangerous chemical weapons the three year crisis in syria has led to a resurgence of interest in chemical weapons,"{\"id\": \"nationalinterest--2020-01-23--Watch Out! Here Are the Five Most Dangerous Chemical Weapons\", \"date\": \"2020-01-23\", \"source\": \"nationalinterest\", \"title\": \"Watch Out! Here Are the Five Most Dangerous Chemical Weapons\", \"content\": \"The three year crisis in Syria has led to a resurgence of interest in chemical weapons. Often referred to as the \\u201cpoor man\\u2019s bomb,\\u201d chemical weapons require a relatively low investment, can cause severe psychological and physical effects and are agents of disruption.\\n\\nModern chemical weapons were introduced during World War I in an effort to reduce the deadlock of trench warfare. But they are subject to topography and weather patterns. As munitions have become more precise, their tactical advantage is being eroded. Today, they horrify more than they contribute to victories on the ground. Their indiscriminate nature and unpredictability, coupled with the sometimes-gruesome effects they have make them effective weapons of fear.\\n\\nBelow are five of the worst chemical weapons:\\n\\nVX belongs to organophosphorus compounds and is classified as a nerve agent because it affects the transmission of nerve impulses in the nervous system. It is odorless and tasteless in its pure form, and appears as a brownish oily liquid.\\n\\nDeveloped in the UK in the early 1950s, VX is particularly potent because it\\u2019s a persistent agent: Once it\\u2019s released into the atmosphere it\\u2019s slow to evaporate. Under regular weather conditions, VX can persist for days on surfaces, while it can last for months in very cold conditions. \\u201cVX vapor is heavier than air,\\u201d which means that when released, \\u201cit will sink to low-lying areas and create a greater exposure hazard there.\\u201d Such characteristics make VX potentially useful as an area-denial weapon.\\n\\nVX is also a fast-acting agent. Symptoms can appear only seconds after exposure. They include salivation, constriction of the pupils and tightness in the chest. As with other nerve agents, VX works by affecting the enzyme (acetylcholinesterase) that acts as the body\\u2019s \\u2018off switch\\u2019 for glands and muscles. With the enzyme blocked, molecules constantly stimulate the muscles. As the muscles spasm, they tire. Death is caused by asphyxiation or heart failure. While it is possible to recover from exposure, tiny amounts of the agent can be lethal.\\n\\nIn September 2013, the UN confirmed that a chemical weapons attack involving specially designed rockets that spread sarin over rebel-held suburbs of the Syrian capital took place the month before. UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon stated that this was the \\u201cmost significant confirmed use of chemical weapons against civilians since Saddam Hussein used them in Halabja in 1988.\\u201d\\n\\nSarin (also known as GB) is a volatile but toxic nerve agent. A single drop the size of the head of a pin is enough to kill an adult human rapidly. It is a colorless and odorless liquid at room temperature, but evaporates rapidly when heated. After release, sarin will spread into the environment rapidly and present an immediate but short-lived threat. Similar to VX, \\u201csymptoms include headaches, salivation and secretion of tears, followed by gradual paralysis of the muscles\\u201d and possible death.\\n\\nSarin was developed in 1938 in Germany when scientists were researching pesticides. The Aum Shinrikyo cult used it in a 1995 attack on the Tokyo subway. While the attack caused mass panic, it only killed 13 because the agent was dispersed in liquid form. In order to maximize casualties, not only must the sarin be a gas, but the particles need to be small enough so they are easily absorbed through the lining of the lungs, yet heavy enough that they are not breathed back out. Sarin is not easy to weaponize.\\n\\nThe quality of the agent also matters. Sarin (and VX) is susceptible to degradation, especially if it isn\\u2019t pure. Iraq\\u2019s sarin for example, had a shelf life of about one to two years. While the degraded products are still toxic, they can\\u2019t be used as weapons. Although Syria\\u2019s CW stockpile was growing old and the agents were likely to have deteriorated significantly, the sarin used in the attack on the Ghouta suburbs on August 21, 2013 was higher quality than that used in the 1995 Tokyo attack or in Halabja. But it was still a far cry from the sarin produced by the United States and the Soviet Union.\\n\\nAlso known as sulphur mustard, this agent gets its name from its trademark rotten mustard or garlic and onion odor. It belongs to the group of blister agents (or vesicants) that work by targeting the eyes, respiratory tract and skin, first as an irritant and then as poison for the body\\u2019s cells. It\\u2019s particularly grisly and slow acting. When skin is exposed to it, it reddens and burns for a few hours before large blisters appear and cause severe scarring and pain. Eyes will swell, tear and possibly go blind a few hours after exposure, and when inhaled or ingested, victims will experience sneezing, hoarseness, coughing up blood, abdominal pain and vomiting.\\n\\nBut exposure to mustard gas is not always fatal. When it was first used in WW1, it killed only 5 percent of those exposed. It became a popular chemical weapon\\u2014used in both world wars, during the civil war in Yemen and the Iran-Iraq war\\u2014because of its properties.\\n\\nAlong with its gruesome physical effects, mustard gas is chemically stable and very persistent. Its fumes are more than six times heavier than air and stay near the ground for several hours. This made it particularly useful for filling and contaminating enemy trenches. It remains toxic for a day or two under average weather conditions and from weeks to months under very cold conditions. What\\u2019s more, persistency can be increased by \\u201cthickening\\u201d the agent: dissolving it in nonvolatile solvents. It poses significant problems for protection, decontamination and treatment.\\n\\nMustard gas is relatively easy to produce, with readily available early precursors. It also retains its quality for a long time. For example, German munitions used in the world wars are still periodically dug up in Belgium and the agents are barely degraded.\\n\\nMustard gas forces enemy troops to wear full protective equipment thereby degrading efficiency. But the protective gear doesn\\u2019t always work. Gas masks, for example, are often not enough. During the Iran-Iraq war, mustard gas seeped through the masks as young Iranians\\u2019 beards (grown for religious purposes) broke the seal of the mask. Mustard gas also easily penetrates through clothes, shoes or other materials.\\n\\nTo this day, phosgene is considered one of the most dangerous existing chemical weapons. It was first used in combination with chlorine gas on December 19, 1915, when Germany dropped 88 tons of the gas on British troops, causing 120 deaths and 1069 casualties. During World War I, it accounted for 80 percent of all chemical fatalities. Although it is not as toxic as sarin or VX, it\\u2019s much easier to make, which makes it more accessible to all.\\n\\nPhosgene is an industrial chemical used in the fabrication of plastics and pesticides.

Often referred to as the \\u201cpoor man\\u2019s bomb,\\u201d chemical weapons require a relatively low investment, can cause severe psychological and physical effects and are agents of disruption.\\n\\nModern chemical weapons were introduced during World War I in an effort to reduce the deadlock of trench warfare. But they are subject to topography and weather patterns. As munitions have become more precise, their tactical advantage is being eroded. Today, they horrify more than they contribute to victories on the ground. Their indiscriminate nature and unpredictability, coupled with the sometimes-gruesome effects they have make them effective weapons of fear.\\n\\nBelow are five of the worst chemical weapons:\\n\\nVX belongs to organophosphorus compounds and is classified as a nerve agent because it affects the transmission of nerve impulses in the nervous system. It is odorless and tasteless in its pure form, and appears as a brownish oily liquid.\\n\\nDeveloped in the UK in the early 1950s, VX is particularly potent because it\\u2019s a persistent agent: Once it\\u2019s released into the atmosphere it\\u2019s slow to evaporate. Under regular weather conditions, VX can persist for days on surfaces, while it can last for months in very cold conditions. \\u201cVX vapor is heavier than air,\\u201d which means that when released, \\u201cit will sink to low-lying areas and create a greater exposure hazard there.\\u201d Such characteristics make VX potentially useful as an area-denial weapon.\\n\\nVX is also a fast-acting agent. Symptoms can appear only seconds after exposure. They include salivation, constriction of the pupils and tightness in the chest. As with other nerve agents, VX works by affecting the enzyme (acetylcholinesterase) that acts as the body\\u2019s \\u2018off switch\\u2019 for glands and muscles. With the enzyme blocked, molecules constantly stimulate the muscles. As the muscles spasm, they tire. Death is caused by asphyxiation or heart failure. While it is possible to recover from exposure, tiny amounts of the agent can be lethal.\\n\\nIn September 2013, the UN confirmed that a chemical weapons attack involving specially designed rockets that spread sarin over rebel-held suburbs of the Syrian capital took place the month before. UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon stated that this was the \\u201cmost significant confirmed use of chemical weapons against civilians since Saddam Hussein used them in Halabja in 1988.\\u201d\\n\\nSarin (also known as GB) is a volatile but toxic nerve agent. A single drop the size of the head of a pin is enough to kill an adult human rapidly. It is a colorless and odorless liquid at room temperature, but evaporates rapidly when heated. After release, sarin will spread into the environment rapidly and present an immediate but short-lived threat. Similar to VX, \\u201csymptoms include headaches, salivation and secretion of tears, followed by gradual paralysis of the muscles\\u201d and possible death.\\n\\nSarin was developed in 1938 in Germany when scientists were researching pesticides. The Aum Shinrikyo cult used it in a 1995 attack on the Tokyo subway. While the attack caused mass panic, it only killed 13 because the agent was dispersed in liquid form. In order to maximize casualties, not only must the sarin be a gas, but the particles need to be small enough so they are easily absorbed through the lining of the lungs, yet heavy enough that they are not breathed back out. Sarin is not easy to weaponize.\\n\\nThe quality of the agent also matters. Sarin (and VX) is susceptible to degradation, especially if it isn\\u2019t pure. Iraq\\u2019s sarin for example, had a shelf life of about one to two years. While the degraded products are still toxic, they can\\u2019t be used as weapons. Although Syria\\u2019s CW stockpile was growing old and the agents were likely to have deteriorated significantly, the sarin used in the attack on the Ghouta suburbs on August 21, 2013 was higher quality than that used in the 1995 Tokyo attack or in Halabja. But it was still a far cry from the sarin produced by the United States and the Soviet Union.\\n\\nAlso known as sulphur mustard, this agent gets its name from its trademark rotten mustard or garlic and onion odor. It belongs to the group of blister agents (or vesicants) that work by targeting the eyes, respiratory tract and skin, first as an irritant and then as poison for the body\\u2019s cells. It\\u2019s particularly grisly and slow acting. When skin is exposed to it, it reddens and burns for a few hours before large blisters appear and cause severe scarring and pain. Eyes will swell, tear and possibly go blind a few hours after exposure, and when inhaled or ingested, victims will experience sneezing, hoarseness, coughing up blood, abdominal pain and vomiting.\\n\\nBut exposure to mustard gas is not always fatal. When it was first used in WW1, it killed only 5 percent of those exposed. It became a popular chemical weapon\\u2014used in both world wars, during the civil war in Yemen and the Iran-Iraq war\\u2014because of its properties.\\n\\nAlong with its gruesome physical effects, mustard gas is chemically stable and very persistent. Its fumes are more than six times heavier than air and stay near the ground for several hours. This made it particularly useful for filling and contaminating enemy trenches. It remains toxic for a day or two under average weather conditions and from weeks to months under very cold conditions. What\\u2019s more, persistency can be increased by \\u201cthickening\\u201d the agent: dissolving it in nonvolatile solvents. It poses significant problems for protection, decontamination and treatment.\\n\\nMustard gas is relatively easy to produce, with readily available early precursors. It also retains its quality for a long time. For example, German munitions used in the world wars are still periodically dug up in Belgium and the agents are barely degraded.\\n\\nMustard gas forces enemy troops to wear full protective equipment thereby degrading efficiency. But the protective gear doesn\\u2019t always work. Gas masks, for example, are often not enough. During the Iran-Iraq war, mustard gas seeped through the masks as young Iranians\\u2019 beards (grown for religious purposes) broke the seal of the mask. Mustard gas also easily penetrates through clothes, shoes or other materials.\\n\\nTo this day, phosgene is considered one of the most dangerous existing chemical weapons. It was first used in combination with chlorine gas on December 19, 1915, when Germany dropped 88 tons of the gas on British troops, causing 120 deaths and 1069 casualties. During World War I, it accounted for 80 percent of all chemical fatalities. Although it is not as toxic as sarin or VX, it\\u2019s much easier to make, which makes it more accessible to all.\\n\\nPhosgene is an industrial chemical used in the fabrication of plastics and pesticides.

Often referred to as the \\u201cpoor man\\u2019s bomb,\\u201d chemical weapons require a relatively low investment, can cause severe psychological and physical effects and are agents of disruption.\\n\\nModern chemical weapons were introduced during World War I in an effort to reduce the deadlock of trench warfare. But they are subject to topography and weather patterns. As munitions have become more precise, their tactical advantage is being eroded. Today, they horrify more than they contribute to victories on the ground. Their indiscriminate nature and unpredictability, coupled with the sometimes-gruesome effects they have make them effective weapons of fear.\\n\\nBelow are five of the worst chemical weapons:\\n\\nVX belongs to organophosphorus compounds and is classified as a nerve agent because it affects the transmission of nerve impulses in the nervous system. It is odorless and tasteless in its pure form, and appears as a brownish oily liquid.\\n\\nDeveloped in the UK in the early 1950s, VX is particularly potent because it\\u2019s a persistent agent: Once it\\u2019s released into the atmosphere it\\u2019s slow to evaporate. Under regular weather conditions, VX can persist for days on surfaces, while it can last for months in very cold conditions. \\u201cVX vapor is heavier than air,\\u201d which means that when released, \\u201cit will sink to low-lying areas and create a greater exposure hazard there.\\u201d Such characteristics make VX potentially useful as an area-denial weapon.\\n\\nVX is also a fast-acting agent. Symptoms can appear only seconds after exposure. They include salivation, constriction of the pupils and tightness in the chest. As with other nerve agents, VX works by affecting the enzyme (acetylcholinesterase) that acts as the body\\u2019s \\u2018off switch\\u2019 for glands and muscles. With the enzyme blocked, molecules constantly stimulate the muscles. As the muscles spasm, they tire. Death is caused by asphyxiation or heart failure. While it is possible to recover from exposure, tiny amounts of the agent can be lethal.\\n\\nIn September 2013, the UN confirmed that a chemical weapons attack involving specially designed rockets that spread sarin over rebel-held suburbs of the Syrian capital took place the month before. UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon stated that this was the \\u201cmost significant confirmed use of chemical weapons against civilians since Saddam Hussein used them in Halabja in 1988.\\u201d\\n\\nSarin (also known as GB) is a volatile but toxic nerve agent. A single drop the size of the head of a pin is enough to kill an adult human rapidly. It is a colorless and odorless liquid at room temperature, but evaporates rapidly when heated. After release, sarin will spread into the environment rapidly and present an immediate but short-lived threat. Similar to VX, \\u201csymptoms include headaches, salivation and secretion of tears, followed by gradual paralysis of the muscles\\u201d and possible death.\\n\\nSarin was developed in 1938 in Germany when scientists were researching pesticides. The Aum Shinrikyo cult used it in a 1995 attack on the Tokyo subway. While the attack caused mass panic, it only killed 13 because the agent was dispersed in liquid form. In order to maximize casualties, not only must the sarin be a gas, but the particles need to be small enough so they are easily absorbed through the lining of the lungs, yet heavy enough that they are not breathed back out. Sarin is not easy to weaponize.\\n\\nThe quality of the agent also matters. Sarin (and VX) is susceptible to degradation, especially if it isn\\u2019t pure. Iraq\\u2019s sarin for example, had a shelf life of about one to two years. While the degraded products are still toxic, they can\\u2019t be used as weapons. Although Syria\\u2019s CW stockpile was growing old and the agents were likely to have deteriorated significantly, the sarin used in the attack on the Ghouta suburbs on August 21, 2013 was higher quality than that used in the 1995 Tokyo attack or in Halabja. But it was still a far cry from the sarin produced by the United States and the Soviet Union.\\n\\nAlso known as sulphur mustard, this agent gets its name from its trademark rotten mustard or garlic and onion odor. It belongs to the group of blister agents (or vesicants) that work by targeting the eyes, respiratory tract and skin, first as an irritant and then as poison for the body\\u2019s cells. It\\u2019s particularly grisly and slow acting. When skin is exposed to it, it reddens and burns for a few hours before large blisters appear and cause severe scarring and pain. Eyes will swell, tear and possibly go blind a few hours after exposure, and when inhaled or ingested, victims will experience sneezing, hoarseness, coughing up blood, abdominal pain and vomiting.\\n\\nBut exposure to mustard gas is not always fatal. When it was first used in WW1, it killed only 5 percent of those exposed. It became a popular chemical weapon\\u2014used in both world wars, during the civil war in Yemen and the Iran-Iraq war\\u2014because of its properties.\\n\\nAlong with its gruesome physical effects, mustard gas is chemically stable and very persistent. Its fumes are more than six times heavier than air and stay near the ground for several hours. This made it particularly useful for filling and contaminating enemy trenches. It remains toxic for a day or two under average weather conditions and from weeks to months under very cold conditions. What\\u2019s more, persistency can be increased by \\u201cthickening\\u201d the agent: dissolving it in nonvolatile solvents. It poses significant problems for protection, decontamination and treatment.\\n\\nMustard gas is relatively easy to produce, with readily available early precursors. It also retains its quality for a long time. For example, German munitions used in the world wars are still periodically dug up in Belgium and the agents are barely degraded.\\n\\nMustard gas forces enemy troops to wear full protective equipment thereby degrading efficiency. But the protective gear doesn\\u2019t always work. Gas masks, for example, are often not enough. During the Iran-Iraq war, mustard gas seeped through the masks as young Iranians\\u2019 beards (grown for religious purposes) broke the seal of the mask. Mustard gas also easily penetrates through clothes, shoes or other materials.\\n\\nTo this day, phosgene is considered one of the most dangerous existing chemical weapons. It was first used in combination with chlorine gas on December 19, 1915, when Germany dropped 88 tons of the gas on British troops, causing 120 deaths and 1069 casualties. During World War I, it accounted for 80 percent of all chemical fatalities. Although it is not as toxic as sarin or VX, it\\u2019s much easier to make, which makes it more accessible to all.\\n\\nPhosgene is an industrial chemical used in the fabrication of plastics and pesticides. It\\u2019s made by exposing chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds to high temperatures. In other words, it can be made at home by exposing chloroform to UV-light for a few days.\\n\\nPhosgene is a choking agent that works by attacking lung tissue. Initial likely symptoms of coughing, choking, tightness in the chest, nausea, and occasionally vomiting occur minutes after exposure. This may seem quick but it actually means that victims continue to inhale it until symptoms become apparent. Delayed effects can occur up to 48 hours after exposure.\\n\\nAt room temperature and pressure, it\\u2019s an almost colorless gas that smells of freshly cut grass in low concentrations. It\\u2019s nonflammable and evaporates when heated above eight degrees, which makes it volatile. But its vapor density is more than three times that of air, which means that it\\u2019ll linger in low-lying areas, including trenches.\\n\\nIn June, OPCW inspectors declared that \\u201cpulmonary irritating agents such as chlorine, have been used in a systematic manner in a number of attacks\\u201d in Syria after Assad pledged to give up its chemical weapons. This led to doubts about the value of the U.S.-Russian deal on the elimination of Syria\\u2019s chemical weapons.\\n\\nChlorine is a readily available industrial chemical with many peaceful uses, including as bleach in paper and cloth, to make pesticides, rubber, and solvents and to kill bacteria in drinking water and swimming pools. It\\u2019s the perfect example of a problematic dual-use chemical. Chlorine did not figure in Assad\\u2019s initial stockpile declaration in October and was not removed with the rest of Syria\\u2019s chemical weapons last month. Despite its dual-use nature, chlorine\\u2019s use as a chemical weapon is still banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).\\n\\nChlorine gas is yellow-green colored and has a strong smell similar to bleach. Like phosgene, it is a choking agent, which obstructs breathing and damages tissues in the body. It can easily be pressurized and cooled to liquid state so that it can be shipped and stored. Chlorine spreads quickly and stays close to the ground because it is heavier than air.

As with other nerve agents, VX works by affecting the enzyme (acetylcholinesterase) that acts as the body\\u2019s \\u2018off switch\\u2019 for glands and muscles. With the enzyme blocked, molecules constantly stimulate the muscles. As the muscles spasm, they tire. Death is caused by asphyxiation or heart failure. While it is possible to recover from exposure, tiny amounts of the agent can be lethal.\\n\\nIn September 2013, the UN confirmed that a chemical weapons attack involving specially designed rockets that spread sarin over rebel-held suburbs of the Syrian capital took place the month before. UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon stated that this was the \\u201cmost significant confirmed use of chemical weapons against civilians since Saddam Hussein used them in Halabja in 1988.\\u201d\\n\\nSarin (also known as GB) is a volatile but toxic nerve agent. A single drop the size of the head of a pin is enough to kill an adult human rapidly. It is a colorless and odorless liquid at room temperature, but evaporates rapidly when heated. After release, sarin will spread into the environment rapidly and present an immediate but short-lived threat. Similar to VX, \\u201csymptoms include headaches, salivation and secretion of tears, followed by gradual paralysis of the muscles\\u201d and possible death.\\n\\nSarin was developed in 1938 in Germany when scientists were researching pesticides. The Aum Shinrikyo cult used it in a 1995 attack on the Tokyo subway. While the attack caused mass panic, it only killed 13 because the agent was dispersed in liquid form. In order to maximize casualties, not only must the sarin be a gas, but the particles need to be small enough so they are easily absorbed through the lining of the lungs, yet heavy enough that they are not breathed back out. Sarin is not easy to weaponize.\\n\\nThe quality of the agent also matters. Sarin (and VX) is susceptible to degradation, especially if it isn\\u2019t pure. Iraq\\u2019s sarin for example, had a shelf life of about one to two years. While the degraded products are still toxic, they can\\u2019t be used as weapons. Although Syria\\u2019s CW stockpile was growing old and the agents were likely to have deteriorated significantly, the sarin used in the attack on the Ghouta suburbs on August 21, 2013 was higher quality than that used in the 1995 Tokyo attack or in Halabja. But it was still a far cry from the sarin produced by the United States and the Soviet Union.\\n\\nAlso known as sulphur mustard, this agent gets its name from its trademark rotten mustard or garlic and onion odor. It belongs to the group of blister agents (or vesicants) that work by targeting the eyes, respiratory tract and skin, first as an irritant and then as poison for the body\\u2019s cells. It\\u2019s particularly grisly and slow acting. When skin is exposed to it, it reddens and burns for a few hours before large blisters appear and cause severe scarring and pain. Eyes will swell, tear and possibly go blind a few hours after exposure, and when inhaled or ingested, victims will experience sneezing, hoarseness, coughing up blood, abdominal pain and vomiting.\\n\\nBut exposure to mustard gas is not always fatal. When it was first used in WW1, it killed only 5 percent of those exposed. It became a popular chemical weapon\\u2014used in both world wars, during the civil war in Yemen and the Iran-Iraq war\\u2014because of its properties.\\n\\nAlong with its gruesome physical effects, mustard gas is chemically stable and very persistent. Its fumes are more than six times heavier than air and stay near the ground for several hours. This made it particularly useful for filling and contaminating enemy trenches. It remains toxic for a day or two under average weather conditions and from weeks to months under very cold conditions. What\\u2019s more, persistency can be increased by \\u201cthickening\\u201d the agent: dissolving it in nonvolatile solvents. It poses significant problems for protection, decontamination and treatment.\\n\\nMustard gas is relatively easy to produce, with readily available early precursors. It also retains its quality for a long time. For example, German munitions used in the world wars are still periodically dug up in Belgium and the agents are barely degraded.\\n\\nMustard gas forces enemy troops to wear full protective equipment thereby degrading efficiency. But the protective gear doesn\\u2019t always work. Gas masks, for example, are often not enough. During the Iran-Iraq war, mustard gas seeped through the masks as young Iranians\\u2019 beards (grown for religious purposes) broke the seal of the mask. Mustard gas also easily penetrates through clothes, shoes or other materials.\\n\\nTo this day, phosgene is considered one of the most dangerous existing chemical weapons. It was first used in combination with chlorine gas on December 19, 1915, when Germany dropped 88 tons of the gas on British troops, causing 120 deaths and 1069 casualties. During World War I, it accounted for 80 percent of all chemical fatalities. Although it is not as toxic as sarin or VX, it\\u2019s much easier to make, which makes it more accessible to all.\\n\\nPhosgene is an industrial chemical used in the fabrication of plastics and pesticides. It\\u2019s made by exposing chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds to high temperatures. In other words, it can be made at home by exposing chloroform to UV-light for a few days.\\n\\nPhosgene is a choking agent that works by attacking lung tissue. Initial likely symptoms of coughing, choking, tightness in the chest, nausea, and occasionally vomiting occur minutes after exposure. This may seem quick but it actually means that victims continue to inhale it until symptoms become apparent. Delayed effects can occur up to 48 hours after exposure.\\n\\nAt room temperature and pressure, it\\u2019s an almost colorless gas that smells of freshly cut grass in low concentrations. It\\u2019s nonflammable and evaporates when heated above eight degrees, which makes it volatile. But its vapor density is more than three times that of air, which means that it\\u2019ll linger in low-lying areas, including trenches.\\n\\nIn June, OPCW inspectors declared that \\u201cpulmonary irritating agents such as chlorine, have been used in a systematic manner in a number of attacks\\u201d in Syria after Assad pledged to give up its chemical weapons. This led to doubts about the value of the U.S.-Russian deal on the elimination of Syria\\u2019s chemical weapons.\\n\\nChlorine is a readily available industrial chemical with many peaceful uses, including as bleach in paper and cloth, to make pesticides, rubber, and solvents and to kill bacteria in drinking water and swimming pools. It\\u2019s the perfect example of a problematic dual-use chemical. Chlorine did not figure in Assad\\u2019s initial stockpile declaration in October and was not removed with the rest of Syria\\u2019s chemical weapons last month. Despite its dual-use nature, chlorine\\u2019s use as a chemical weapon is still banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).\\n\\nChlorine gas is yellow-green colored and has a strong smell similar to bleach. Like phosgene, it is a choking agent, which obstructs breathing and damages tissues in the body. It can easily be pressurized and cooled to liquid state so that it can be shipped and stored. Chlorine spreads quickly and stays close to the ground because it is heavier than air.

Although Syria\\u2019s CW stockpile was growing old and the agents were likely to have deteriorated significantly, the sarin used in the attack on the Ghouta suburbs on August 21, 2013 was higher quality than that used in the 1995 Tokyo attack or in Halabja. But it was still a far cry from the sarin produced by the United States and the Soviet Union.\\n\\nAlso known as sulphur mustard, this agent gets its name from its trademark rotten mustard or garlic and onion odor. It belongs to the group of blister agents (or vesicants) that work by targeting the eyes, respiratory tract and skin, first as an irritant and then as poison for the body\\u2019s cells. It\\u2019s particularly grisly and slow acting. When skin is exposed to it, it reddens and burns for a few hours before large blisters appear and cause severe scarring and pain. Eyes will swell, tear and possibly go blind a few hours after exposure, and when inhaled or ingested, victims will experience sneezing, hoarseness, coughing up blood, abdominal pain and vomiting.\\n\\nBut exposure to mustard gas is not always fatal. When it was first used in WW1, it killed only 5 percent of those exposed. It became a popular chemical weapon\\u2014used in both world wars, during the civil war in Yemen and the Iran-Iraq war\\u2014because of its properties.\\n\\nAlong with its gruesome physical effects, mustard gas is chemically stable and very persistent. Its fumes are more than six times heavier than air and stay near the ground for several hours. This made it particularly useful for filling and contaminating enemy trenches. It remains toxic for a day or two under average weather conditions and from weeks to months under very cold conditions. What\\u2019s more, persistency can be increased by \\u201cthickening\\u201d the agent: dissolving it in nonvolatile solvents. It poses significant problems for protection, decontamination and treatment.\\n\\nMustard gas is relatively easy to produce, with readily available early precursors. It also retains its quality for a long time. For example, German munitions used in the world wars are still periodically dug up in Belgium and the agents are barely degraded.\\n\\nMustard gas forces enemy troops to wear full protective equipment thereby degrading efficiency. But the protective gear doesn\\u2019t always work. Gas masks, for example, are often not enough. During the Iran-Iraq war, mustard gas seeped through the masks as young Iranians\\u2019 beards (grown for religious purposes) broke the seal of the mask. Mustard gas also easily penetrates through clothes, shoes or other materials.\\n\\nTo this day, phosgene is considered one of the most dangerous existing chemical weapons. It was first used in combination with chlorine gas on December 19, 1915, when Germany dropped 88 tons of the gas on British troops, causing 120 deaths and 1069 casualties. During World War I, it accounted for 80 percent of all chemical fatalities. Although it is not as toxic as sarin or VX, it\\u2019s much easier to make, which makes it more accessible to all.\\n\\nPhosgene is an industrial chemical used in the fabrication of plastics and pesticides. It\\u2019s made by exposing chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds to high temperatures. In other words, it can be made at home by exposing chloroform to UV-light for a few days.\\n\\nPhosgene is a choking agent that works by attacking lung tissue. Initial likely symptoms of coughing, choking, tightness in the chest, nausea, and occasionally vomiting occur minutes after exposure. This may seem quick but it actually means that victims continue to inhale it until symptoms become apparent. Delayed effects can occur up to 48 hours after exposure.\\n\\nAt room temperature and pressure, it\\u2019s an almost colorless gas that smells of freshly cut grass in low concentrations. It\\u2019s nonflammable and evaporates when heated above eight degrees, which makes it volatile. But its vapor density is more than three times that of air, which means that it\\u2019ll linger in low-lying areas, including trenches.\\n\\nIn June, OPCW inspectors declared that \\u201cpulmonary irritating agents such as chlorine, have been used in a systematic manner in a number of attacks\\u201d in Syria after Assad pledged to give up its chemical weapons. This led to doubts about the value of the U.S.-Russian deal on the elimination of Syria\\u2019s chemical weapons.\\n\\nChlorine is a readily available industrial chemical with many peaceful uses, including as bleach in paper and cloth, to make pesticides, rubber, and solvents and to kill bacteria in drinking water and swimming pools. It\\u2019s the perfect example of a problematic dual-use chemical. Chlorine did not figure in Assad\\u2019s initial stockpile declaration in October and was not removed with the rest of Syria\\u2019s chemical weapons last month. Despite its dual-use nature, chlorine\\u2019s use as a chemical weapon is still banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).\\n\\nChlorine gas is yellow-green colored and has a strong smell similar to bleach. Like phosgene, it is a choking agent, which obstructs breathing and damages tissues in the body. It can easily be pressurized and cooled to liquid state so that it can be shipped and stored. Chlorine spreads quickly and stays close to the ground because it is heavier than air. Though it is less lethal than other chemical agents, chlorine is dangerous because it\\u2019s easy to manufacture and disguise.\", \"author\": \"Dina Esfandiary\", \"url\": \"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/watch-out-here-are-five-most-dangerous-chemical-weapons-116041\", \"published\": \"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 04:00 EST\", \"published_utc\": 1579770000, \"collection_utc\": 1579796715}",News,1579770000

Often referred to as the \\u201cpoor man\\u2019s bomb,\\u201d chemical weapons require a relatively low investment, can cause severe psychological and physical effects and are agents of disruption.\\n\\nModern chemical weapons were introduced during World War I in an effort to reduce the deadlock of trench warfare. But they are subject to topography and weather patterns. As munitions have become more precise, their tactical advantage is being eroded. Today, they horrify more than they contribute to victories on the ground. Their indiscriminate nature and unpredictability, coupled with the sometimes-gruesome effects they have make them effective weapons of fear.\\n\\nBelow are five of the worst chemical weapons:\\n\\nVX belongs to organophosphorus compounds and is classified as a nerve agent because it affects the transmission of nerve impulses in the nervous system. It is odorless and tasteless in its pure form, and appears as a brownish oily liquid.\\n\\nDeveloped in the UK in the early 1950s, VX is particularly potent because it\\u2019s a persistent agent: Once it\\u2019s released into the atmosphere it\\u2019s slow to evaporate. Under regular weather conditions, VX can persist for days on surfaces, while it can last for months in very cold conditions. \\u201cVX vapor is heavier than air,\\u201d which means that when released, \\u201cit will sink to low-lying areas and create a greater exposure hazard there.\\u201d Such characteristics make VX potentially useful as an area-denial weapon.\\n\\nVX is also a fast-acting agent. Symptoms can appear only seconds after exposure. They include salivation, constriction of the pupils and tightness in the chest. As with other nerve agents, VX works by affecting the enzyme (acetylcholinesterase) that acts as the body\\u2019s \\u2018off switch\\u2019 for glands and muscles. With the enzyme blocked, molecules constantly stimulate the muscles. As the muscles spasm, they tire. Death is caused by asphyxiation or heart failure. While it is possible to recover from exposure, tiny amounts of the agent can be lethal.\\n\\nIn September 2013, the UN confirmed that a chemical weapons attack involving specially designed rockets that spread sarin over rebel-held suburbs of the Syrian capital took place the month before. UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon stated that this was the \\u201cmost significant confirmed use of chemical weapons against civilians since Saddam Hussein used them in Halabja in 1988.\\u201d\\n\\nSarin (also known as GB) is a volatile but toxic nerve agent. A single drop the size of the head of a pin is enough to kill an adult human rapidly. It is a colorless and odorless liquid at room temperature, but evaporates rapidly when heated. After release, sarin will spread into the environment rapidly and present an immediate but short-lived threat. Similar to VX, \\u201csymptoms include headaches, salivation and secretion of tears, followed by gradual paralysis of the muscles\\u201d and possible death.\\n\\nSarin was developed in 1938 in Germany when scientists were researching pesticides. The Aum Shinrikyo cult used it in a 1995 attack on the Tokyo subway. While the attack caused mass panic, it only killed 13 because the agent was dispersed in liquid form. In order to maximize casualties, not only must the sarin be a gas, but the particles need to be small enough so they are easily absorbed through the lining of the lungs, yet heavy enough that they are not breathed back out.

Battlefield America: T... John W. Whitehead Best Price: $10.95 Buy New $18.80\\n\\nMark my words: the government will remain as corrupt and self-serving as ever, dominated by two political factions that pretend to be at odds with each other all the while moving in lockstep to maintain the status quo.\\n\\nSo President Trump\\u2019s legal team can grandstand all they want about the impeachment trial being \\u201can affront to the Constitution\\u201d and \\u201ca dangerous perversion of the Constitution,\\u201d but that\\u2019s just smoke and mirrors.\\n\\nYou know what is really \\u201can affront to the Constitution\\u201d? The U.S. government.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve been losing our freedoms so incrementally for so long\\u2014sold to us in the name of national security and global peace, maintained by way of martial law disguised as law and order, and enforced by a standing army of militarized police and a political elite determined to maintain their powers at all costs\\u2014that it\\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when it all started going downhill, but we\\u2019re certainly on that downward trajectory now, and things are moving fast.\\n\\nThe Deep State\\u2019s plot to take over America has succeeded.\\n\\nThe American system of representative government has been overthrown by a profit-driven, militaristic, corporate oligarchy bent on total control and global domination through the imposition of martial law here at home and by fomenting wars abroad.\\n\\nEven now, we are being pushed and prodded towards a civil war, not because the American people are so divided but because that\\u2019s how corrupt governments control a populace (i.e., divide and conquer).\\n\\nThese are indeed dangerous times but not because of violent crime, which remains at an all-time low, or because of terrorism, which is statistically rare, or because the borders are being invaded by foreign armies, which data reports from the Department of Homeland Security refute.\\n\\nNo, the real danger that we face comes from none other than the U.S. government and the powers it has granted to its standing armies to rob, steal, cheat, harass, detain, brutalize, terrorize, torture and kill American citizens with immunity.\\n\\nThe danger \\u201cwe the people\\u201d face comes from masked invaders on the government payroll who crash through our doors in the dark of night, shoot our dogs, and terrorize our families.\\n\\nThis danger comes from militarized henchmen on the government payroll who demand absolute obedience, instill abject fear, and shoot first and ask questions later.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy, power-hungry bureaucrats on the government payroll who have little to no understanding of their constitutional limits.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy politicians and corporations for whom profit trumps principle.\\n\\nYou want to know about the state of our union? It\\u2019s downright scary.\\n\\nConsider, if you will, all of the dastardly, devious, diabolical, dangerous, debilitating, deceitful, dehumanizing, demonic, depraved, dishonorable, disillusioning, discriminatory, dictatorial schemes inflicted on \\u201cwe the people\\u201d by a bureaucratic, totalitarian regime that has long since ceased to be \\u201ca government of the people, by the people and for the people.\\u201d\\n\\nAmericans have no protection against police abuse. It is no longer unusual to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals first and ask questions later, such as the 16-year-old teenager who skipped school only to be shot by police after they mistook him for a fleeing burglar. Then there was the unarmed black man in Texas \\u201cwho was pursued and shot in the back of the neck by Austin Police\\u2026 after failing to properly identify himself and leaving the scene of an unrelated incident.\\u201d And who could forget the 19-year-old Seattle woman who was accidentally shot in the leg by police after she refused to show her hands? What is increasingly common, however, is the news that the officers involved in these incidents get off with little more than a slap on the hands.\\n\\nAmericans are little more than pocketbooks to fund the police state. If there is any absolute maxim by which the federal government seems to operate, it is that the American taxpayer always gets ripped off. This is true, whether you\\u2019re talking about taxpayers being forced to fund high-priced weaponry that will be used against us, endless wars that do little for our safety or our freedoms, or bloated government agencies such as the National Security Agency with its secret budgets, covert agendas and clandestine activities. Rubbing salt in the wound, even monetary awards in lawsuits against government officials who are found guilty of wrongdoing are paid by the taxpayer.\\n\\nAmericans are no longer innocent until proven guilty. We once operated under the assumption that you were innocent until proven guilty. Due in large part to rapid advances in technology and a heightened surveillance culture, the burden of proof has been shifted so that the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty has been usurped by a new norm in which all citizens are suspects. This is exemplified by police practices of stopping and frisking people who are merely walking down the street and where there is no evidence of wrongdoing. Likewise, by subjecting Americans to full-body scans and license-plate readers without their knowledge or compliance and then storing the scans for later use, the government\\u2014in cahoots with the corporate state\\u2014has erected the ultimate suspect society. In such an environment, we are all potentially guilty of some wrongdoing or other.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to self-defense. In the wake of various shootings in recent years, \\u201cgun control\\u201d has become a resounding theme. Those advocating gun reform see the Second Amendment\\u2019s right to bear arms as applying only to government officials. As a result, even Americans who legally own firearms are being treated with suspicion and, in some cases, undue violence. In one case, a Texas man had his home subjected to a no-knock raid and was shot in his bed after police, attempting to deliver a routine search warrant, learned that he was in legal possession of a firearm. In another incident, a Florida man who was licensed to carry a concealed firearm found himself detained for two hours during a routine traffic stop in Maryland while the arresting officer searched his vehicle in vain for the man\\u2019s gun, which he had left at home. Incidentally, the Trump Administration has done more to crack down on Second Amendment rights than anything the Obama Administration ever managed.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to private property. If government agents can invade your home, break down your doors, kill your dog, damage your furnishings and terrorize your family, your property is no longer private and secure\\u2014it belongs to the government. Likewise, if government officials can fine and arrest you for growing vegetables in your front yard, praying with friends in your living room, installing solar panels on your roof, and raising chickens in your backyard, you\\u2019re no longer the owner of your property.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a say about what their children are exposed to in school. Incredibly, the government continues to insist that parents essentially forfeit their rights when they send their children to a public school. This growing tension over whether young people, especially those in the public schools, are essentially wards of the state, to do with as government officials deem appropriate, in defiance of the children\\u2019s constitutional rights and those of their parents, is reflected in the debate over sex education programs that expose young people to all manner of sexual practices and terminology, zero tolerance policies that strip students of any due process rights, let alone parental involvement in school discipline, and Common Core programs that teach students to be test-takers rather than critical thinkers.\\n\\nAmericans are powerless in the face of militarized police. In early America, citizens were considered equals with law enforcement officials. Authorities were rarely permitted to enter one\\u2019s home without permission or in a deceitful manner. And it was not uncommon for police officers to be held personally liable for trespass when they wrongfully invaded a citizen\\u2019s home. Unlike today, early Americans could resist arrest when a police officer tried to restrain them without proper justification or a warrant\\u2014which the police had to allow citizens to read before arresting them. (Daring to dispute a warrant with a police official today who is armed with high-tech military weapons and tasers would be nothing short of suicidal.) As police forces across the country continue to be transformed into outposts of the military, with police agencies acquiring military-grade hardware in droves, Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts, complete with tanks, weaponry, and other equipment designed for the battlefield.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to bodily integrity. Court rulings undermining the Fourth Amendment and justifying invasive strip searches have left us powerless against police empowered to forcefully draw our blood, strip search us, and probe us intimately. Accounts are on the rise of individuals\\u2014men and women\\u2014being subjected to what is essentially government-sanctioned rape by police in the course of \\u201croutine\\u201d traffic stops. Remember the New Mexico man who was subjected to a 12-hour ordeal of anal probes, X-rays, enemas, and finally a colonoscopy\\u2014all because he allegedly rolled through a stop sign?\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to the expectation of privacy. Despite the staggering number of revelations about government spying on Americans\\u2019 phone calls, Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, Google searches, emails, bookstore and grocery purchases, bank statements, commuter toll records, etc., Congress, the president and the courts have done little to nothing to counteract these abuses. Instead, they seem determined to accustom us to life in this electronic concentration camp.\\n\\nAmericans can no longer rely on the courts to mete out justice. The U.S. Supreme Court was intended to be an institution established to intervene and protect the people against the government and its agents when they overstep their bounds. Yet through their deference to police power, preference for security over freedom, and evisceration of our most basic rights for the sake of order and expediency, the justices of the Supreme Court have become the architects of the American police state in which we now live, while the lower courts have appointed themselves courts of order, concerned primarily with advancing the government\\u2019s agenda, no matter how unjust or illegal.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a representative government. We have moved beyond the era of representative government and entered a new age, let\\u2019s call it the age of authoritarianism. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called \\u201ceconomic elite.\\u201d Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. It is not overstating matters to say that Congress, which has done its best to keep their unhappy constituents at a distance, may well be the most self-serving, semi-corrupt institution in America.\\n\\nIn other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism: a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. Rest assured that when and if fascism finally takes hold in America, the basic forms of government will remain: Fascism will appear to be friendly. The legislators will be in session. There will be elections, and the news media will continue to cover the entertainment and political trivia. Consent of the governed, however, will no longer apply. Actual control will have finally passed to the oligarchic elite controlling the government behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Clearly, we are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests. We have moved into \\u201ccorporatism\\u201d (favored by Benito Mussolini), which is a halfway point on the road to full-blown fascism. Corporatism is where the few moneyed interests\\u2014not elected by the citizenry\\u2014rule over the many.\\n\\nHistory may show that from this point forward, we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a totalitarian state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom. Even with its constantly shifting terrain, this topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America\\u2019s new normal. From Clinton to Bush, then Obama and now Trump, it\\u2019s as if we\\u2019ve been caught in a time loop, forced to re-live the same thing over and over again: the same assaults on our freedoms, the same disregard for the rule of law, the same subservience to the Deep State, and the same corrupt, self-serving government that exists only to amass power, enrich its shareholders and ensure its continued domination. A Government of Wolves... John W.

If government agents can invade your home, break down your doors, kill your dog, damage your furnishings and terrorize your family, your property is no longer private and secure\\u2014it belongs to the government. Likewise, if government officials can fine and arrest you for growing vegetables in your front yard, praying with friends in your living room, installing solar panels on your roof, and raising chickens in your backyard, you\\u2019re no longer the owner of your property.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a say about what their children are exposed to in school. Incredibly, the government continues to insist that parents essentially forfeit their rights when they send their children to a public school. This growing tension over whether young people, especially those in the public schools, are essentially wards of the state, to do with as government officials deem appropriate, in defiance of the children\\u2019s constitutional rights and those of their parents, is reflected in the debate over sex education programs that expose young people to all manner of sexual practices and terminology, zero tolerance policies that strip students of any due process rights, let alone parental involvement in school discipline, and Common Core programs that teach students to be test-takers rather than critical thinkers.\\n\\nAmericans are powerless in the face of militarized police. In early America, citizens were considered equals with law enforcement officials. Authorities were rarely permitted to enter one\\u2019s home without permission or in a deceitful manner. And it was not uncommon for police officers to be held personally liable for trespass when they wrongfully invaded a citizen\\u2019s home. Unlike today, early Americans could resist arrest when a police officer tried to restrain them without proper justification or a warrant\\u2014which the police had to allow citizens to read before arresting them. (Daring to dispute a warrant with a police official today who is armed with high-tech military weapons and tasers would be nothing short of suicidal.) As police forces across the country continue to be transformed into outposts of the military, with police agencies acquiring military-grade hardware in droves, Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts, complete with tanks, weaponry, and other equipment designed for the battlefield.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to bodily integrity. Court rulings undermining the Fourth Amendment and justifying invasive strip searches have left us powerless against police empowered to forcefully draw our blood, strip search us, and probe us intimately. Accounts are on the rise of individuals\\u2014men and women\\u2014being subjected to what is essentially government-sanctioned rape by police in the course of \\u201croutine\\u201d traffic stops. Remember the New Mexico man who was subjected to a 12-hour ordeal of anal probes, X-rays, enemas, and finally a colonoscopy\\u2014all because he allegedly rolled through a stop sign?\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to the expectation of privacy. Despite the staggering number of revelations about government spying on Americans\\u2019 phone calls, Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, Google searches, emails, bookstore and grocery purchases, bank statements, commuter toll records, etc., Congress, the president and the courts have done little to nothing to counteract these abuses. Instead, they seem determined to accustom us to life in this electronic concentration camp.\\n\\nAmericans can no longer rely on the courts to mete out justice. The U.S. Supreme Court was intended to be an institution established to intervene and protect the people against the government and its agents when they overstep their bounds. Yet through their deference to police power, preference for security over freedom, and evisceration of our most basic rights for the sake of order and expediency, the justices of the Supreme Court have become the architects of the American police state in which we now live, while the lower courts have appointed themselves courts of order, concerned primarily with advancing the government\\u2019s agenda, no matter how unjust or illegal.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a representative government. We have moved beyond the era of representative government and entered a new age, let\\u2019s call it the age of authoritarianism. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called \\u201ceconomic elite.\\u201d Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. It is not overstating matters to say that Congress, which has done its best to keep their unhappy constituents at a distance, may well be the most self-serving, semi-corrupt institution in America.\\n\\nIn other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism: a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. Rest assured that when and if fascism finally takes hold in America, the basic forms of government will remain: Fascism will appear to be friendly. The legislators will be in session. There will be elections, and the news media will continue to cover the entertainment and political trivia. Consent of the governed, however, will no longer apply. Actual control will have finally passed to the oligarchic elite controlling the government behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Clearly, we are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests. We have moved into \\u201ccorporatism\\u201d (favored by Benito Mussolini), which is a halfway point on the road to full-blown fascism. Corporatism is where the few moneyed interests\\u2014not elected by the citizenry\\u2014rule over the many.\\n\\nHistory may show that from this point forward, we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a totalitarian state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom. Even with its constantly shifting terrain, this topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America\\u2019s new normal. From Clinton to Bush, then Obama and now Trump, it\\u2019s as if we\\u2019ve been caught in a time loop, forced to re-live the same thing over and over again: the same assaults on our freedoms, the same disregard for the rule of law, the same subservience to the Deep State, and the same corrupt, self-serving government that exists only to amass power, enrich its shareholders and ensure its continued domination.

Incredibly, the government continues to insist that parents essentially forfeit their rights when they send their children to a public school. This growing tension over whether young people, especially those in the public schools, are essentially wards of the state, to do with as government officials deem appropriate, in defiance of the children\\u2019s constitutional rights and those of their parents, is reflected in the debate over sex education programs that expose young people to all manner of sexual practices and terminology, zero tolerance policies that strip students of any due process rights, let alone parental involvement in school discipline, and Common Core programs that teach students to be test-takers rather than critical thinkers.\\n\\nAmericans are powerless in the face of militarized police. In early America, citizens were considered equals with law enforcement officials. Authorities were rarely permitted to enter one\\u2019s home without permission or in a deceitful manner. And it was not uncommon for police officers to be held personally liable for trespass when they wrongfully invaded a citizen\\u2019s home. Unlike today, early Americans could resist arrest when a police officer tried to restrain them without proper justification or a warrant\\u2014which the police had to allow citizens to read before arresting them. (Daring to dispute a warrant with a police official today who is armed with high-tech military weapons and tasers would be nothing short of suicidal.) As police forces across the country continue to be transformed into outposts of the military, with police agencies acquiring military-grade hardware in droves, Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts, complete with tanks, weaponry, and other equipment designed for the battlefield.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to bodily integrity. Court rulings undermining the Fourth Amendment and justifying invasive strip searches have left us powerless against police empowered to forcefully draw our blood, strip search us, and probe us intimately. Accounts are on the rise of individuals\\u2014men and women\\u2014being subjected to what is essentially government-sanctioned rape by police in the course of \\u201croutine\\u201d traffic stops. Remember the New Mexico man who was subjected to a 12-hour ordeal of anal probes, X-rays, enemas, and finally a colonoscopy\\u2014all because he allegedly rolled through a stop sign?\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to the expectation of privacy. Despite the staggering number of revelations about government spying on Americans\\u2019 phone calls, Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, Google searches, emails, bookstore and grocery purchases, bank statements, commuter toll records, etc., Congress, the president and the courts have done little to nothing to counteract these abuses. Instead, they seem determined to accustom us to life in this electronic concentration camp.\\n\\nAmericans can no longer rely on the courts to mete out justice. The U.S. Supreme Court was intended to be an institution established to intervene and protect the people against the government and its agents when they overstep their bounds. Yet through their deference to police power, preference for security over freedom, and evisceration of our most basic rights for the sake of order and expediency, the justices of the Supreme Court have become the architects of the American police state in which we now live, while the lower courts have appointed themselves courts of order, concerned primarily with advancing the government\\u2019s agenda, no matter how unjust or illegal.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a representative government. We have moved beyond the era of representative government and entered a new age, let\\u2019s call it the age of authoritarianism. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called \\u201ceconomic elite.\\u201d Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. It is not overstating matters to say that Congress, which has done its best to keep their unhappy constituents at a distance, may well be the most self-serving, semi-corrupt institution in America.\\n\\nIn other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism: a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. Rest assured that when and if fascism finally takes hold in America, the basic forms of government will remain: Fascism will appear to be friendly. The legislators will be in session. There will be elections, and the news media will continue to cover the entertainment and political trivia. Consent of the governed, however, will no longer apply. Actual control will have finally passed to the oligarchic elite controlling the government behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Clearly, we are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests. We have moved into \\u201ccorporatism\\u201d (favored by Benito Mussolini), which is a halfway point on the road to full-blown fascism. Corporatism is where the few moneyed interests\\u2014not elected by the citizenry\\u2014rule over the many.\\n\\nHistory may show that from this point forward, we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a totalitarian state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom. Even with its constantly shifting terrain, this topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America\\u2019s new normal. From Clinton to Bush, then Obama and now Trump, it\\u2019s as if we\\u2019ve been caught in a time loop, forced to re-live the same thing over and over again: the same assaults on our freedoms, the same disregard for the rule of law, the same subservience to the Deep State, and the same corrupt, self-serving government that exists only to amass power, enrich its shareholders and ensure its continued domination. A Government of Wolves... John W.

The U.S. government.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve been losing our freedoms so incrementally for so long\\u2014sold to us in the name of national security and global peace, maintained by way of martial law disguised as law and order, and enforced by a standing army of militarized police and a political elite determined to maintain their powers at all costs\\u2014that it\\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when it all started going downhill, but we\\u2019re certainly on that downward trajectory now, and things are moving fast.\\n\\nThe Deep State\\u2019s plot to take over America has succeeded.\\n\\nThe American system of representative government has been overthrown by a profit-driven, militaristic, corporate oligarchy bent on total control and global domination through the imposition of martial law here at home and by fomenting wars abroad.\\n\\nEven now, we are being pushed and prodded towards a civil war, not because the American people are so divided but because that\\u2019s how corrupt governments control a populace (i.e., divide and conquer).\\n\\nThese are indeed dangerous times but not because of violent crime, which remains at an all-time low, or because of terrorism, which is statistically rare, or because the borders are being invaded by foreign armies, which data reports from the Department of Homeland Security refute.\\n\\nNo, the real danger that we face comes from none other than the U.S. government and the powers it has granted to its standing armies to rob, steal, cheat, harass, detain, brutalize, terrorize, torture and kill American citizens with immunity.\\n\\nThe danger \\u201cwe the people\\u201d face comes from masked invaders on the government payroll who crash through our doors in the dark of night, shoot our dogs, and terrorize our families.\\n\\nThis danger comes from militarized henchmen on the government payroll who demand absolute obedience, instill abject fear, and shoot first and ask questions later.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy, power-hungry bureaucrats on the government payroll who have little to no understanding of their constitutional limits.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy politicians and corporations for whom profit trumps principle.\\n\\nYou want to know about the state of our union? It\\u2019s downright scary.\\n\\nConsider, if you will, all of the dastardly, devious, diabolical, dangerous, debilitating, deceitful, dehumanizing, demonic, depraved, dishonorable, disillusioning, discriminatory, dictatorial schemes inflicted on \\u201cwe the people\\u201d by a bureaucratic, totalitarian regime that has long since ceased to be \\u201ca government of the people, by the people and for the people.\\u201d\\n\\nAmericans have no protection against police abuse. It is no longer unusual to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals first and ask questions later, such as the 16-year-old teenager who skipped school only to be shot by police after they mistook him for a fleeing burglar. Then there was the unarmed black man in Texas \\u201cwho was pursued and shot in the back of the neck by Austin Police\\u2026 after failing to properly identify himself and leaving the scene of an unrelated incident.\\u201d And who could forget the 19-year-old Seattle woman who was accidentally shot in the leg by police after she refused to show her hands? What is increasingly common, however, is the news that the officers involved in these incidents get off with little more than a slap on the hands.\\n\\nAmericans are little more than pocketbooks to fund the police state. If there is any absolute maxim by which the federal government seems to operate, it is that the American taxpayer always gets ripped off. This is true, whether you\\u2019re talking about taxpayers being forced to fund high-priced weaponry that will be used against us, endless wars that do little for our safety or our freedoms, or bloated government agencies such as the National Security Agency with its secret budgets, covert agendas and clandestine activities. Rubbing salt in the wound, even monetary awards in lawsuits against government officials who are found guilty of wrongdoing are paid by the taxpayer.\\n\\nAmericans are no longer innocent until proven guilty. We once operated under the assumption that you were innocent until proven guilty. Due in large part to rapid advances in technology and a heightened surveillance culture, the burden of proof has been shifted so that the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty has been usurped by a new norm in which all citizens are suspects. This is exemplified by police practices of stopping and frisking people who are merely walking down the street and where there is no evidence of wrongdoing. Likewise, by subjecting Americans to full-body scans and license-plate readers without their knowledge or compliance and then storing the scans for later use, the government\\u2014in cahoots with the corporate state\\u2014has erected the ultimate suspect society. In such an environment, we are all potentially guilty of some wrongdoing or other.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to self-defense. In the wake of various shootings in recent years, \\u201cgun control\\u201d has become a resounding theme. Those advocating gun reform see the Second Amendment\\u2019s right to bear arms as applying only to government officials. As a result, even Americans who legally own firearms are being treated with suspicion and, in some cases, undue violence. In one case, a Texas man had his home subjected to a no-knock raid and was shot in his bed after police, attempting to deliver a routine search warrant, learned that he was in legal possession of a firearm. In another incident, a Florida man who was licensed to carry a concealed firearm found himself detained for two hours during a routine traffic stop in Maryland while the arresting officer searched his vehicle in vain for the man\\u2019s gun, which he had left at home. Incidentally, the Trump Administration has done more to crack down on Second Amendment rights than anything the Obama Administration ever managed.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to private property. If government agents can invade your home, break down your doors, kill your dog, damage your furnishings and terrorize your family, your property is no longer private and secure\\u2014it belongs to the government. Likewise, if government officials can fine and arrest you for growing vegetables in your front yard, praying with friends in your living room, installing solar panels on your roof, and raising chickens in your backyard, you\\u2019re no longer the owner of your property.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a say about what their children are exposed to in school.

This growing tension over whether young people, especially those in the public schools, are essentially wards of the state, to do with as government officials deem appropriate, in defiance of the children\\u2019s constitutional rights and those of their parents, is reflected in the debate over sex education programs that expose young people to all manner of sexual practices and terminology, zero tolerance policies that strip students of any due process rights, let alone parental involvement in school discipline, and Common Core programs that teach students to be test-takers rather than critical thinkers.\\n\\nAmericans are powerless in the face of militarized police. In early America, citizens were considered equals with law enforcement officials. Authorities were rarely permitted to enter one\\u2019s home without permission or in a deceitful manner. And it was not uncommon for police officers to be held personally liable for trespass when they wrongfully invaded a citizen\\u2019s home. Unlike today, early Americans could resist arrest when a police officer tried to restrain them without proper justification or a warrant\\u2014which the police had to allow citizens to read before arresting them. (Daring to dispute a warrant with a police official today who is armed with high-tech military weapons and tasers would be nothing short of suicidal.) As police forces across the country continue to be transformed into outposts of the military, with police agencies acquiring military-grade hardware in droves, Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts, complete with tanks, weaponry, and other equipment designed for the battlefield.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to bodily integrity. Court rulings undermining the Fourth Amendment and justifying invasive strip searches have left us powerless against police empowered to forcefully draw our blood, strip search us, and probe us intimately. Accounts are on the rise of individuals\\u2014men and women\\u2014being subjected to what is essentially government-sanctioned rape by police in the course of \\u201croutine\\u201d traffic stops. Remember the New Mexico man who was subjected to a 12-hour ordeal of anal probes, X-rays, enemas, and finally a colonoscopy\\u2014all because he allegedly rolled through a stop sign?\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to the expectation of privacy. Despite the staggering number of revelations about government spying on Americans\\u2019 phone calls, Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, Google searches, emails, bookstore and grocery purchases, bank statements, commuter toll records, etc., Congress, the president and the courts have done little to nothing to counteract these abuses. Instead, they seem determined to accustom us to life in this electronic concentration camp.\\n\\nAmericans can no longer rely on the courts to mete out justice. The U.S. Supreme Court was intended to be an institution established to intervene and protect the people against the government and its agents when they overstep their bounds. Yet through their deference to police power, preference for security over freedom, and evisceration of our most basic rights for the sake of order and expediency, the justices of the Supreme Court have become the architects of the American police state in which we now live, while the lower courts have appointed themselves courts of order, concerned primarily with advancing the government\\u2019s agenda, no matter how unjust or illegal.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a representative government. We have moved beyond the era of representative government and entered a new age, let\\u2019s call it the age of authoritarianism. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called \\u201ceconomic elite.\\u201d Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. It is not overstating matters to say that Congress, which has done its best to keep their unhappy constituents at a distance, may well be the most self-serving, semi-corrupt institution in America.\\n\\nIn other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism: a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. Rest assured that when and if fascism finally takes hold in America, the basic forms of government will remain: Fascism will appear to be friendly. The legislators will be in session. There will be elections, and the news media will continue to cover the entertainment and political trivia. Consent of the governed, however, will no longer apply. Actual control will have finally passed to the oligarchic elite controlling the government behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Clearly, we are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests. We have moved into \\u201ccorporatism\\u201d (favored by Benito Mussolini), which is a halfway point on the road to full-blown fascism. Corporatism is where the few moneyed interests\\u2014not elected by the citizenry\\u2014rule over the many.\\n\\nHistory may show that from this point forward, we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a totalitarian state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom. Even with its constantly shifting terrain, this topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America\\u2019s new normal. From Clinton to Bush, then Obama and now Trump, it\\u2019s as if we\\u2019ve been caught in a time loop, forced to re-live the same thing over and over again: the same assaults on our freedoms, the same disregard for the rule of law, the same subservience to the Deep State, and the same corrupt, self-serving government that exists only to amass power, enrich its shareholders and ensure its continued domination. A Government of Wolves... John W. Whitehead Best Price: $1.16 Buy New $2.99\\n\\nElections will not save us.\\n\\nI haven\\u2019t even touched on the corporate state, the military industrial complex, SWAT team raids, invasive surveillance technology, zero tolerance policies in the schools, overcriminalization, or privatized prisons, to name just a few, but what I have touched on should be enough to show that the landscape of our freedoms has already changed dramatically from what it once was and will no doubt continue to deteriorate unless Americans can find a way to wrest back control of their government and reclaim their freedoms.\\n\\nThere can be no denying that the world is indeed a dangerous place, but what the president and his cohorts fail to acknowledge is that it\\u2019s the government that poses the gravest threat to our freedoms and way of life, and no amount of politicking, parsing or pandering will change that.\\n\\nIt is easy to be diverted, distracted and amused by the antics of politicians, the pomp and circumstance of awards shows, athletic events, and entertainment news, and the feel-good, wrapped-in-the-flag evangelism that passes for religion today.\\n\\nWhat is far more difficult to face up to is the reality of life in America, where unemployment, poverty, inequality, injustice and violence by government agents are increasingly norms, and where \\u201cwe the people\\u201d are at a distinct disadvantage in the face of the government elite\\u2019s power grabs, greed and firepower.\\n\\nThe Constitution doesn\\u2019t stand a chance against a federalized, globalized standing army protected by legislative, judicial and executive branches that are all on the same side, no matter what political views they subscribe to: suffice it to say, they are not on our side or the side of freedom.\\n\\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the powers-that-be want us to remain distracted, divided, alienated from each other based on our politics, our bank accounts, our religion, our race and our value systems.

The U.S. government.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve been losing our freedoms so incrementally for so long\\u2014sold to us in the name of national security and global peace, maintained by way of martial law disguised as law and order, and enforced by a standing army of militarized police and a political elite determined to maintain their powers at all costs\\u2014that it\\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when it all started going downhill, but we\\u2019re certainly on that downward trajectory now, and things are moving fast.\\n\\nThe Deep State\\u2019s plot to take over America has succeeded.\\n\\nThe American system of representative government has been overthrown by a profit-driven, militaristic, corporate oligarchy bent on total control and global domination through the imposition of martial law here at home and by fomenting wars abroad.\\n\\nEven now, we are being pushed and prodded towards a civil war, not because the American people are so divided but because that\\u2019s how corrupt governments control a populace (i.e., divide and conquer).\\n\\nThese are indeed dangerous times but not because of violent crime, which remains at an all-time low, or because of terrorism, which is statistically rare, or because the borders are being invaded by foreign armies, which data reports from the Department of Homeland Security refute.\\n\\nNo, the real danger that we face comes from none other than the U.S. government and the powers it has granted to its standing armies to rob, steal, cheat, harass, detain, brutalize, terrorize, torture and kill American citizens with immunity.\\n\\nThe danger \\u201cwe the people\\u201d face comes from masked invaders on the government payroll who crash through our doors in the dark of night, shoot our dogs, and terrorize our families.\\n\\nThis danger comes from militarized henchmen on the government payroll who demand absolute obedience, instill abject fear, and shoot first and ask questions later.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy, power-hungry bureaucrats on the government payroll who have little to no understanding of their constitutional limits.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy politicians and corporations for whom profit trumps principle.\\n\\nYou want to know about the state of our union? It\\u2019s downright scary.\\n\\nConsider, if you will, all of the dastardly, devious, diabolical, dangerous, debilitating, deceitful, dehumanizing, demonic, depraved, dishonorable, disillusioning, discriminatory, dictatorial schemes inflicted on \\u201cwe the people\\u201d by a bureaucratic, totalitarian regime that has long since ceased to be \\u201ca government of the people, by the people and for the people.\\u201d\\n\\nAmericans have no protection against police abuse. It is no longer unusual to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals first and ask questions later, such as the 16-year-old teenager who skipped school only to be shot by police after they mistook him for a fleeing burglar. Then there was the unarmed black man in Texas \\u201cwho was pursued and shot in the back of the neck by Austin Police\\u2026 after failing to properly identify himself and leaving the scene of an unrelated incident.\\u201d And who could forget the 19-year-old Seattle woman who was accidentally shot in the leg by police after she refused to show her hands? What is increasingly common, however, is the news that the officers involved in these incidents get off with little more than a slap on the hands.\\n\\nAmericans are little more than pocketbooks to fund the police state. If there is any absolute maxim by which the federal government seems to operate, it is that the American taxpayer always gets ripped off. This is true, whether you\\u2019re talking about taxpayers being forced to fund high-priced weaponry that will be used against us, endless wars that do little for our safety or our freedoms, or bloated government agencies such as the National Security Agency with its secret budgets, covert agendas and clandestine activities. Rubbing salt in the wound, even monetary awards in lawsuits against government officials who are found guilty of wrongdoing are paid by the taxpayer.\\n\\nAmericans are no longer innocent until proven guilty. We once operated under the assumption that you were innocent until proven guilty. Due in large part to rapid advances in technology and a heightened surveillance culture, the burden of proof has been shifted so that the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty has been usurped by a new norm in which all citizens are suspects. This is exemplified by police practices of stopping and frisking people who are merely walking down the street and where there is no evidence of wrongdoing. Likewise, by subjecting Americans to full-body scans and license-plate readers without their knowledge or compliance and then storing the scans for later use, the government\\u2014in cahoots with the corporate state\\u2014has erected the ultimate suspect society. In such an environment, we are all potentially guilty of some wrongdoing or other.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to self-defense. In the wake of various shootings in recent years, \\u201cgun control\\u201d has become a resounding theme. Those advocating gun reform see the Second Amendment\\u2019s right to bear arms as applying only to government officials. As a result, even Americans who legally own firearms are being treated with suspicion and, in some cases, undue violence. In one case, a Texas man had his home subjected to a no-knock raid and was shot in his bed after police, attempting to deliver a routine search warrant, learned that he was in legal possession of a firearm. In another incident, a Florida man who was licensed to carry a concealed firearm found himself detained for two hours during a routine traffic stop in Maryland while the arresting officer searched his vehicle in vain for the man\\u2019s gun, which he had left at home. Incidentally, the Trump Administration has done more to crack down on Second Amendment rights than anything the Obama Administration ever managed.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to private property. If government agents can invade your home, break down your doors, kill your dog, damage your furnishings and terrorize your family, your property is no longer private and secure\\u2014it belongs to the government. Likewise, if government officials can fine and arrest you for growing vegetables in your front yard, praying with friends in your living room, installing solar panels on your roof, and raising chickens in your backyard, you\\u2019re no longer the owner of your property.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a say about what their children are exposed to in school.

This growing tension over whether young people, especially those in the public schools, are essentially wards of the state, to do with as government officials deem appropriate, in defiance of the children\\u2019s constitutional rights and those of their parents, is reflected in the debate over sex education programs that expose young people to all manner of sexual practices and terminology, zero tolerance policies that strip students of any due process rights, let alone parental involvement in school discipline, and Common Core programs that teach students to be test-takers rather than critical thinkers.\\n\\nAmericans are powerless in the face of militarized police. In early America, citizens were considered equals with law enforcement officials. Authorities were rarely permitted to enter one\\u2019s home without permission or in a deceitful manner. And it was not uncommon for police officers to be held personally liable for trespass when they wrongfully invaded a citizen\\u2019s home. Unlike today, early Americans could resist arrest when a police officer tried to restrain them without proper justification or a warrant\\u2014which the police had to allow citizens to read before arresting them. (Daring to dispute a warrant with a police official today who is armed with high-tech military weapons and tasers would be nothing short of suicidal.) As police forces across the country continue to be transformed into outposts of the military, with police agencies acquiring military-grade hardware in droves, Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts, complete with tanks, weaponry, and other equipment designed for the battlefield.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to bodily integrity. Court rulings undermining the Fourth Amendment and justifying invasive strip searches have left us powerless against police empowered to forcefully draw our blood, strip search us, and probe us intimately. Accounts are on the rise of individuals\\u2014men and women\\u2014being subjected to what is essentially government-sanctioned rape by police in the course of \\u201croutine\\u201d traffic stops. Remember the New Mexico man who was subjected to a 12-hour ordeal of anal probes, X-rays, enemas, and finally a colonoscopy\\u2014all because he allegedly rolled through a stop sign?\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to the expectation of privacy. Despite the staggering number of revelations about government spying on Americans\\u2019 phone calls, Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, Google searches, emails, bookstore and grocery purchases, bank statements, commuter toll records, etc., Congress, the president and the courts have done little to nothing to counteract these abuses. Instead, they seem determined to accustom us to life in this electronic concentration camp.\\n\\nAmericans can no longer rely on the courts to mete out justice. The U.S. Supreme Court was intended to be an institution established to intervene and protect the people against the government and its agents when they overstep their bounds. Yet through their deference to police power, preference for security over freedom, and evisceration of our most basic rights for the sake of order and expediency, the justices of the Supreme Court have become the architects of the American police state in which we now live, while the lower courts have appointed themselves courts of order, concerned primarily with advancing the government\\u2019s agenda, no matter how unjust or illegal.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a representative government. We have moved beyond the era of representative government and entered a new age, let\\u2019s call it the age of authoritarianism. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called \\u201ceconomic elite.\\u201d Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. It is not overstating matters to say that Congress, which has done its best to keep their unhappy constituents at a distance, may well be the most self-serving, semi-corrupt institution in America.\\n\\nIn other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism: a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. Rest assured that when and if fascism finally takes hold in America, the basic forms of government will remain: Fascism will appear to be friendly. The legislators will be in session. There will be elections, and the news media will continue to cover the entertainment and political trivia. Consent of the governed, however, will no longer apply. Actual control will have finally passed to the oligarchic elite controlling the government behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Clearly, we are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests. We have moved into \\u201ccorporatism\\u201d (favored by Benito Mussolini), which is a halfway point on the road to full-blown fascism. Corporatism is where the few moneyed interests\\u2014not elected by the citizenry\\u2014rule over the many.\\n\\nHistory may show that from this point forward, we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a totalitarian state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom. Even with its constantly shifting terrain, this topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America\\u2019s new normal. From Clinton to Bush, then Obama and now Trump, it\\u2019s as if we\\u2019ve been caught in a time loop, forced to re-live the same thing over and over again: the same assaults on our freedoms, the same disregard for the rule of law, the same subservience to the Deep State, and the same corrupt, self-serving government that exists only to amass power, enrich its shareholders and ensure its continued domination.

The U.S. government.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve been losing our freedoms so incrementally for so long\\u2014sold to us in the name of national security and global peace, maintained by way of martial law disguised as law and order, and enforced by a standing army of militarized police and a political elite determined to maintain their powers at all costs\\u2014that it\\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when it all started going downhill, but we\\u2019re certainly on that downward trajectory now, and things are moving fast.\\n\\nThe Deep State\\u2019s plot to take over America has succeeded.\\n\\nThe American system of representative government has been overthrown by a profit-driven, militaristic, corporate oligarchy bent on total control and global domination through the imposition of martial law here at home and by fomenting wars abroad.\\n\\nEven now, we are being pushed and prodded towards a civil war, not because the American people are so divided but because that\\u2019s how corrupt governments control a populace (i.e., divide and conquer).\\n\\nThese are indeed dangerous times but not because of violent crime, which remains at an all-time low, or because of terrorism, which is statistically rare, or because the borders are being invaded by foreign armies, which data reports from the Department of Homeland Security refute.\\n\\nNo, the real danger that we face comes from none other than the U.S. government and the powers it has granted to its standing armies to rob, steal, cheat, harass, detain, brutalize, terrorize, torture and kill American citizens with immunity.\\n\\nThe danger \\u201cwe the people\\u201d face comes from masked invaders on the government payroll who crash through our doors in the dark of night, shoot our dogs, and terrorize our families.\\n\\nThis danger comes from militarized henchmen on the government payroll who demand absolute obedience, instill abject fear, and shoot first and ask questions later.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy, power-hungry bureaucrats on the government payroll who have little to no understanding of their constitutional limits.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy politicians and corporations for whom profit trumps principle.\\n\\nYou want to know about the state of our union? It\\u2019s downright scary.\\n\\nConsider, if you will, all of the dastardly, devious, diabolical, dangerous, debilitating, deceitful, dehumanizing, demonic, depraved, dishonorable, disillusioning, discriminatory, dictatorial schemes inflicted on \\u201cwe the people\\u201d by a bureaucratic, totalitarian regime that has long since ceased to be \\u201ca government of the people, by the people and for the people.\\u201d\\n\\nAmericans have no protection against police abuse. It is no longer unusual to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals first and ask questions later, such as the 16-year-old teenager who skipped school only to be shot by police after they mistook him for a fleeing burglar. Then there was the unarmed black man in Texas \\u201cwho was pursued and shot in the back of the neck by Austin Police\\u2026 after failing to properly identify himself and leaving the scene of an unrelated incident.\\u201d And who could forget the 19-year-old Seattle woman who was accidentally shot in the leg by police after she refused to show her hands? What is increasingly common, however, is the news that the officers involved in these incidents get off with little more than a slap on the hands.\\n\\nAmericans are little more than pocketbooks to fund the police state. If there is any absolute maxim by which the federal government seems to operate, it is that the American taxpayer always gets ripped off. This is true, whether you\\u2019re talking about taxpayers being forced to fund high-priced weaponry that will be used against us, endless wars that do little for our safety or our freedoms, or bloated government agencies such as the National Security Agency with its secret budgets, covert agendas and clandestine activities. Rubbing salt in the wound, even monetary awards in lawsuits against government officials who are found guilty of wrongdoing are paid by the taxpayer.\\n\\nAmericans are no longer innocent until proven guilty. We once operated under the assumption that you were innocent until proven guilty. Due in large part to rapid advances in technology and a heightened surveillance culture, the burden of proof has been shifted so that the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty has been usurped by a new norm in which all citizens are suspects. This is exemplified by police practices of stopping and frisking people who are merely walking down the street and where there is no evidence of wrongdoing. Likewise, by subjecting Americans to full-body scans and license-plate readers without their knowledge or compliance and then storing the scans for later use, the government\\u2014in cahoots with the corporate state\\u2014has erected the ultimate suspect society. In such an environment, we are all potentially guilty of some wrongdoing or other.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to self-defense. In the wake of various shootings in recent years, \\u201cgun control\\u201d has become a resounding theme. Those advocating gun reform see the Second Amendment\\u2019s right to bear arms as applying only to government officials. As a result, even Americans who legally own firearms are being treated with suspicion and, in some cases, undue violence. In one case, a Texas man had his home subjected to a no-knock raid and was shot in his bed after police, attempting to deliver a routine search warrant, learned that he was in legal possession of a firearm. In another incident, a Florida man who was licensed to carry a concealed firearm found himself detained for two hours during a routine traffic stop in Maryland while the arresting officer searched his vehicle in vain for the man\\u2019s gun, which he had left at home. Incidentally, the Trump Administration has done more to crack down on Second Amendment rights than anything the Obama Administration ever managed.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to private property. If government agents can invade your home, break down your doors, kill your dog, damage your furnishings and terrorize your family, your property is no longer private and secure\\u2014it belongs to the government. Likewise, if government officials can fine and arrest you for growing vegetables in your front yard, praying with friends in your living room, installing solar panels on your roof, and raising chickens in your backyard, you\\u2019re no longer the owner of your property.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a say about what their children are exposed to in school.

This growing tension over whether young people, especially those in the public schools, are essentially wards of the state, to do with as government officials deem appropriate, in defiance of the children\\u2019s constitutional rights and those of their parents, is reflected in the debate over sex education programs that expose young people to all manner of sexual practices and terminology, zero tolerance policies that strip students of any due process rights, let alone parental involvement in school discipline, and Common Core programs that teach students to be test-takers rather than critical thinkers.\\n\\nAmericans are powerless in the face of militarized police. In early America, citizens were considered equals with law enforcement officials. Authorities were rarely permitted to enter one\\u2019s home without permission or in a deceitful manner. And it was not uncommon for police officers to be held personally liable for trespass when they wrongfully invaded a citizen\\u2019s home. Unlike today, early Americans could resist arrest when a police officer tried to restrain them without proper justification or a warrant\\u2014which the police had to allow citizens to read before arresting them. (Daring to dispute a warrant with a police official today who is armed with high-tech military weapons and tasers would be nothing short of suicidal.) As police forces across the country continue to be transformed into outposts of the military, with police agencies acquiring military-grade hardware in droves, Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts, complete with tanks, weaponry, and other equipment designed for the battlefield.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to bodily integrity. Court rulings undermining the Fourth Amendment and justifying invasive strip searches have left us powerless against police empowered to forcefully draw our blood, strip search us, and probe us intimately. Accounts are on the rise of individuals\\u2014men and women\\u2014being subjected to what is essentially government-sanctioned rape by police in the course of \\u201croutine\\u201d traffic stops. Remember the New Mexico man who was subjected to a 12-hour ordeal of anal probes, X-rays, enemas, and finally a colonoscopy\\u2014all because he allegedly rolled through a stop sign?\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to the expectation of privacy. Despite the staggering number of revelations about government spying on Americans\\u2019 phone calls, Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, Google searches, emails, bookstore and grocery purchases, bank statements, commuter toll records, etc., Congress, the president and the courts have done little to nothing to counteract these abuses. Instead, they seem determined to accustom us to life in this electronic concentration camp.\\n\\nAmericans can no longer rely on the courts to mete out justice. The U.S. Supreme Court was intended to be an institution established to intervene and protect the people against the government and its agents when they overstep their bounds. Yet through their deference to police power, preference for security over freedom, and evisceration of our most basic rights for the sake of order and expediency, the justices of the Supreme Court have become the architects of the American police state in which we now live, while the lower courts have appointed themselves courts of order, concerned primarily with advancing the government\\u2019s agenda, no matter how unjust or illegal.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a representative government. We have moved beyond the era of representative government and entered a new age, let\\u2019s call it the age of authoritarianism. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called \\u201ceconomic elite.\\u201d Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. It is not overstating matters to say that Congress, which has done its best to keep their unhappy constituents at a distance, may well be the most self-serving, semi-corrupt institution in America.\\n\\nIn other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism: a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. Rest assured that when and if fascism finally takes hold in America, the basic forms of government will remain: Fascism will appear to be friendly. The legislators will be in session. There will be elections, and the news media will continue to cover the entertainment and political trivia. Consent of the governed, however, will no longer apply. Actual control will have finally passed to the oligarchic elite controlling the government behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Clearly, we are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests. We have moved into \\u201ccorporatism\\u201d (favored by Benito Mussolini), which is a halfway point on the road to full-blown fascism. Corporatism is where the few moneyed interests\\u2014not elected by the citizenry\\u2014rule over the many.\\n\\nHistory may show that from this point forward, we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a totalitarian state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom. Even with its constantly shifting terrain, this topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America\\u2019s new normal. From Clinton to Bush, then Obama and now Trump, it\\u2019s as if we\\u2019ve been caught in a time loop, forced to re-live the same thing over and over again: the same assaults on our freedoms, the same disregard for the rule of law, the same subservience to the Deep State, and the same corrupt, self-serving government that exists only to amass power, enrich its shareholders and ensure its continued domination.

If there is any absolute maxim by which the federal government seems to operate, it is that the American taxpayer always gets ripped off. This is true, whether you\\u2019re talking about taxpayers being forced to fund high-priced weaponry that will be used against us, endless wars that do little for our safety or our freedoms, or bloated government agencies such as the National Security Agency with its secret budgets, covert agendas and clandestine activities.

We once operated under the assumption that you were innocent until proven guilty.

This is exemplified by police practices of stopping and frisking people who are merely walking down the street and where there is no evidence of wrongdoing. Likewise, by subjecting Americans to full-body scans and license-plate readers without their knowledge or compliance and then storing the scans for later use, the government\\u2014in cahoots with the corporate state\\u2014has erected the ultimate suspect society.

As a result, even Americans who legally own firearms are being treated with suspicion and, in some cases, undue violence. In one case, a Texas man had his home subjected to a no-knock raid and was shot in his bed after police, attempting to deliver a routine search warrant, learned that he was in legal possession of a firearm. In another incident, a Florida man who was licensed to carry a concealed firearm found himself detained for two hours during a routine traffic stop in Maryland while the arresting officer searched his vehicle in vain for the man\\u2019s gun, which he had left at home. Incidentally, the Trump Administration has done more to crack down on Second Amendment rights than anything the Obama Administration ever managed.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to private property.

This growing tension over whether young people, especially those in the public schools, are essentially wards of the state, to do with as government officials deem appropriate, in defiance of the children\\u2019s constitutional rights and those of their parents, is reflected in the debate over sex education programs that expose young people to all manner of sexual practices and terminology, zero tolerance policies that strip students of any due process rights, let alone parental involvement in school discipline, and Common Core programs that teach students to be test-takers rather than critical thinkers.\\n\\nAmericans are powerless in the face of militarized police. In early America, citizens were considered equals with law enforcement officials. Authorities were rarely permitted to enter one\\u2019s home without permission or in a deceitful manner. And it was not uncommon for police officers to be held personally liable for trespass when they wrongfully invaded a citizen\\u2019s home. Unlike today, early Americans could resist arrest when a police officer tried to restrain them without proper justification or a warrant\\u2014which the police had to allow citizens to read before arresting them. (Daring to dispute a warrant with a police official today who is armed with high-tech military weapons and tasers would be nothing short of suicidal.) As police forces across the country continue to be transformed into outposts of the military, with police agencies acquiring military-grade hardware in droves, Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts, complete with tanks, weaponry, and other equipment designed for the battlefield.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to bodily integrity. Court rulings undermining the Fourth Amendment and justifying invasive strip searches have left us powerless against police empowered to forcefully draw our blood, strip search us, and probe us intimately. Accounts are on the rise of individuals\\u2014men and women\\u2014being subjected to what is essentially government-sanctioned rape by police in the course of \\u201croutine\\u201d traffic stops. Remember the New Mexico man who was subjected to a 12-hour ordeal of anal probes, X-rays, enemas, and finally a colonoscopy\\u2014all because he allegedly rolled through a stop sign?\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to the expectation of privacy. Despite the staggering number of revelations about government spying on Americans\\u2019 phone calls, Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, Google searches, emails, bookstore and grocery purchases, bank statements, commuter toll records, etc., Congress, the president and the courts have done little to nothing to counteract these abuses. Instead, they seem determined to accustom us to life in this electronic concentration camp.\\n\\nAmericans can no longer rely on the courts to mete out justice. The U.S. Supreme Court was intended to be an institution established to intervene and protect the people against the government and its agents when they overstep their bounds. Yet through their deference to police power, preference for security over freedom, and evisceration of our most basic rights for the sake of order and expediency, the justices of the Supreme Court have become the architects of the American police state in which we now live, while the lower courts have appointed themselves courts of order, concerned primarily with advancing the government\\u2019s agenda, no matter how unjust or illegal.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a representative government. We have moved beyond the era of representative government and entered a new age, let\\u2019s call it the age of authoritarianism. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called \\u201ceconomic elite.\\u201d Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. It is not overstating matters to say that Congress, which has done its best to keep their unhappy constituents at a distance, may well be the most self-serving, semi-corrupt institution in America.\\n\\nIn other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism: a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. Rest assured that when and if fascism finally takes hold in America, the basic forms of government will remain: Fascism will appear to be friendly. The legislators will be in session. There will be elections, and the news media will continue to cover the entertainment and political trivia. Consent of the governed, however, will no longer apply. Actual control will have finally passed to the oligarchic elite controlling the government behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Clearly, we are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests. We have moved into \\u201ccorporatism\\u201d (favored by Benito Mussolini), which is a halfway point on the road to full-blown fascism. Corporatism is where the few moneyed interests\\u2014not elected by the citizenry\\u2014rule over the many.\\n\\nHistory may show that from this point forward, we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a totalitarian state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom. Even with its constantly shifting terrain, this topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America\\u2019s new normal. From Clinton to Bush, then Obama and now Trump, it\\u2019s as if we\\u2019ve been caught in a time loop, forced to re-live the same thing over and over again: the same assaults on our freedoms, the same disregard for the rule of law, the same subservience to the Deep State, and the same corrupt, self-serving government that exists only to amass power, enrich its shareholders and ensure its continued domination.\\n\\nElections will not save us.\\n\\nI haven\\u2019t even touched on the corporate state, the military industrial complex, SWAT team raids, invasive surveillance technology, zero tolerance policies in the schools, overcriminalization, or privatized prisons, to name just a few, but what I have touched on should be enough to show that the landscape of our freedoms has already changed dramatically from what it once was and will no doubt continue to deteriorate unless Americans can find a way to wrest back control of their government and reclaim their freedoms.\\n\\nThere can be no denying that the world is indeed a dangerous place, but what the president and his cohorts fail to acknowledge is that it\\u2019s the government that poses the gravest threat to our freedoms and way of life, and no amount of politicking, parsing or pandering will change that.\\n\\nIt is easy to be diverted, distracted and amused by the antics of politicians, the pomp and circumstance of awards shows, athletic events, and entertainment news, and the feel-good, wrapped-in-the-flag evangelism that passes for religion today.\\n\\nWhat is far more difficult to face up to is the reality of life in America, where unemployment, poverty, inequality, injustice and violence by government agents are increasingly norms, and where \\u201cwe the people\\u201d are at a distinct disadvantage in the face of the government elite\\u2019s power grabs, greed and firepower.\\n\\nThe Constitution doesn\\u2019t stand a chance against a federalized, globalized standing army protected by legislative, judicial and executive branches that are all on the same side, no matter what political views they subscribe to: suffice it to say, they are not on our side or the side of freedom.\\n\\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the powers-that-be want us to remain distracted, divided, alienated from each other based on our politics, our bank accounts, our religion, our race and our value systems.

It is no longer unusual to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals first and ask questions later, such as the 16-year-old teenager who skipped school only to be shot by police after they mistook him for a fleeing burglar. Then there was the unarmed black man in Texas \\u201cwho was pursued and shot in the back of the neck by Austin Police\\u2026 after failing to properly identify himself and leaving the scene of an unrelated incident.\\u201d And who could forget the 19-year-old Seattle woman who was accidentally shot in the leg by police after she refused to show her hands? What is increasingly common, however, is the news that the officers involved in these incidents get off with little more than a slap on the hands.\\n\\nAmericans are little more than pocketbooks to fund the police state. If there is any absolute maxim by which the federal government seems to operate, it is that the American taxpayer always gets ripped off. This is true, whether you\\u2019re talking about taxpayers being forced to fund high-priced weaponry that will be used against us, endless wars that do little for our safety or our freedoms, or bloated government agencies such as the National Security Agency with its secret budgets, covert agendas and clandestine activities. Rubbing salt in the wound, even monetary awards in lawsuits against government officials who are found guilty of wrongdoing are paid by the taxpayer.\\n\\nAmericans are no longer innocent until proven guilty. We once operated under the assumption that you were innocent until proven guilty. Due in large part to rapid advances in technology and a heightened surveillance culture, the burden of proof has been shifted so that the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty has been usurped by a new norm in which all citizens are suspects. This is exemplified by police practices of stopping and frisking people who are merely walking down the street and where there is no evidence of wrongdoing. Likewise, by subjecting Americans to full-body scans and license-plate readers without their knowledge or compliance and then storing the scans for later use, the government\\u2014in cahoots with the corporate state\\u2014has erected the ultimate suspect society.

In the wake of various shootings in recent years, \\u201cgun control\\u201d has become a resounding theme. Those advocating gun reform see the Second Amendment\\u2019s right to bear arms as applying only to government officials. As a result, even Americans who legally own firearms are being treated with suspicion and, in some cases, undue violence. In one case, a Texas man had his home subjected to a no-knock raid and was shot in his bed after police, attempting to deliver a routine search warrant, learned that he was in legal possession of a firearm. In another incident, a Florida man who was licensed to carry a concealed firearm found himself detained for two hours during a routine traffic stop in Maryland while the arresting officer searched his vehicle in vain for the man\\u2019s gun, which he had left at home. Incidentally, the Trump Administration has done more to crack down on Second Amendment rights than anything the Obama Administration ever managed.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to private property. If government agents can invade your home, break down your doors, kill your dog, damage your furnishings and terrorize your family, your property is no longer private and secure\\u2014it belongs to the government.

Unlike today, early Americans could resist arrest when a police officer tried to restrain them without proper justification or a warrant\\u2014which the police had to allow citizens to read before arresting them. (Daring to dispute a warrant with a police official today who is armed with high-tech military weapons and tasers would be nothing short of suicidal.) As police forces across the country continue to be transformed into outposts of the military, with police agencies acquiring military-grade hardware in droves, Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts, complete with tanks, weaponry, and other equipment designed for the battlefield.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to bodily integrity. Court rulings undermining the Fourth Amendment and justifying invasive strip searches have left us powerless against police empowered to forcefully draw our blood, strip search us, and probe us intimately. Accounts are on the rise of individuals\\u2014men and women\\u2014being subjected to what is essentially government-sanctioned rape by police in the course of \\u201croutine\\u201d traffic stops. Remember the New Mexico man who was subjected to a 12-hour ordeal of anal probes, X-rays, enemas, and finally a colonoscopy\\u2014all because he allegedly rolled through a stop sign?\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to the expectation of privacy. Despite the staggering number of revelations about government spying on Americans\\u2019 phone calls, Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, Google searches, emails, bookstore and grocery purchases, bank statements, commuter toll records, etc., Congress, the president and the courts have done little to nothing to counteract these abuses. Instead, they seem determined to accustom us to life in this electronic concentration camp.\\n\\nAmericans can no longer rely on the courts to mete out justice. The U.S. Supreme Court was intended to be an institution established to intervene and protect the people against the government and its agents when they overstep their bounds. Yet through their deference to police power, preference for security over freedom, and evisceration of our most basic rights for the sake of order and expediency, the justices of the Supreme Court have become the architects of the American police state in which we now live, while the lower courts have appointed themselves courts of order, concerned primarily with advancing the government\\u2019s agenda, no matter how unjust or illegal.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a representative government. We have moved beyond the era of representative government and entered a new age, let\\u2019s call it the age of authoritarianism. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called \\u201ceconomic elite.\\u201d Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. It is not overstating matters to say that Congress, which has done its best to keep their unhappy constituents at a distance, may well be the most self-serving, semi-corrupt institution in America.\\n\\nIn other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism: a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. Rest assured that when and if fascism finally takes hold in America, the basic forms of government will remain: Fascism will appear to be friendly. The legislators will be in session. There will be elections, and the news media will continue to cover the entertainment and political trivia. Consent of the governed, however, will no longer apply. Actual control will have finally passed to the oligarchic elite controlling the government behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Clearly, we are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests. We have moved into \\u201ccorporatism\\u201d (favored by Benito Mussolini), which is a halfway point on the road to full-blown fascism. Corporatism is where the few moneyed interests\\u2014not elected by the citizenry\\u2014rule over the many.\\n\\nHistory may show that from this point forward, we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a totalitarian state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom. Even with its constantly shifting terrain, this topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America\\u2019s new normal. From Clinton to Bush, then Obama and now Trump, it\\u2019s as if we\\u2019ve been caught in a time loop, forced to re-live the same thing over and over again: the same assaults on our freedoms, the same disregard for the rule of law, the same subservience to the Deep State, and the same corrupt, self-serving government that exists only to amass power, enrich its shareholders and ensure its continued domination.\\n\\nElections will not save us.\\n\\nI haven\\u2019t even touched on the corporate state, the military industrial complex, SWAT team raids, invasive surveillance technology, zero tolerance policies in the schools, overcriminalization, or privatized prisons, to name just a few, but what I have touched on should be enough to show that the landscape of our freedoms has already changed dramatically from what it once was and will no doubt continue to deteriorate unless Americans can find a way to wrest back control of their government and reclaim their freedoms.\\n\\nThere can be no denying that the world is indeed a dangerous place, but what the president and his cohorts fail to acknowledge is that it\\u2019s the government that poses the gravest threat to our freedoms and way of life, and no amount of politicking, parsing or pandering will change that.\\n\\nIt is easy to be diverted, distracted and amused by the antics of politicians, the pomp and circumstance of awards shows, athletic events, and entertainment news, and the feel-good, wrapped-in-the-flag evangelism that passes for religion today.\\n\\nWhat is far more difficult to face up to is the reality of life in America, where unemployment, poverty, inequality, injustice and violence by government agents are increasingly norms, and where \\u201cwe the people\\u201d are at a distinct disadvantage in the face of the government elite\\u2019s power grabs, greed and firepower.\\n\\nThe Constitution doesn\\u2019t stand a chance against a federalized, globalized standing army protected by legislative, judicial and executive branches that are all on the same side, no matter what political views they subscribe to: suffice it to say, they are not on our side or the side of freedom.\\n\\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the powers-that-be want us to remain distracted, divided, alienated from each other based on our politics, our bank accounts, our religion, our race and our value systems. Yet as George Orwell observed, \\u201cThe real division is not between conservatives and revolutionaries but between authoritarians and libertarians.\\u201d\\n\\nYou either believe in freedom or you don\\u2019t. It\\u2019s that simple.\\n\\nEverything else is just a deadly distraction.

The U.S. government.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve been losing our freedoms so incrementally for so long\\u2014sold to us in the name of national security and global peace, maintained by way of martial law disguised as law and order, and enforced by a standing army of militarized police and a political elite determined to maintain their powers at all costs\\u2014that it\\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when it all started going downhill, but we\\u2019re certainly on that downward trajectory now, and things are moving fast.\\n\\nThe Deep State\\u2019s plot to take over America has succeeded.\\n\\nThe American system of representative government has been overthrown by a profit-driven, militaristic, corporate oligarchy bent on total control and global domination through the imposition of martial law here at home and by fomenting wars abroad.\\n\\nEven now, we are being pushed and prodded towards a civil war, not because the American people are so divided but because that\\u2019s how corrupt governments control a populace (i.e., divide and conquer).\\n\\nThese are indeed dangerous times but not because of violent crime, which remains at an all-time low, or because of terrorism, which is statistically rare, or because the borders are being invaded by foreign armies, which data reports from the Department of Homeland Security refute.\\n\\nNo, the real danger that we face comes from none other than the U.S. government and the powers it has granted to its standing armies to rob, steal, cheat, harass, detain, brutalize, terrorize, torture and kill American citizens with immunity.\\n\\nThe danger \\u201cwe the people\\u201d face comes from masked invaders on the government payroll who crash through our doors in the dark of night, shoot our dogs, and terrorize our families.\\n\\nThis danger comes from militarized henchmen on the government payroll who demand absolute obedience, instill abject fear, and shoot first and ask questions later.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy, power-hungry bureaucrats on the government payroll who have little to no understanding of their constitutional limits.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy politicians and corporations for whom profit trumps principle.\\n\\nYou want to know about the state of our union? It\\u2019s downright scary.\\n\\nConsider, if you will, all of the dastardly, devious, diabolical, dangerous, debilitating, deceitful, dehumanizing, demonic, depraved, dishonorable, disillusioning, discriminatory, dictatorial schemes inflicted on \\u201cwe the people\\u201d by a bureaucratic, totalitarian regime that has long since ceased to be \\u201ca government of the people, by the people and for the people.\\u201d\\n\\nAmericans have no protection against police abuse. It is no longer unusual to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals first and ask questions later, such as the 16-year-old teenager who skipped school only to be shot by police after they mistook him for a fleeing burglar. Then there was the unarmed black man in Texas \\u201cwho was pursued and shot in the back of the neck by Austin Police\\u2026 after failing to properly identify himself and leaving the scene of an unrelated incident.\\u201d And who could forget the 19-year-old Seattle woman who was accidentally shot in the leg by police after she refused to show her hands? What is increasingly common, however, is the news that the officers involved in these incidents get off with little more than a slap on the hands.\\n\\nAmericans are little more than pocketbooks to fund the police state. If there is any absolute maxim by which the federal government seems to operate, it is that the American taxpayer always gets ripped off. This is true, whether you\\u2019re talking about taxpayers being forced to fund high-priced weaponry that will be used against us, endless wars that do little for our safety or our freedoms, or bloated government agencies such as the National Security Agency with its secret budgets, covert agendas and clandestine activities. Rubbing salt in the wound, even monetary awards in lawsuits against government officials who are found guilty of wrongdoing are paid by the taxpayer.\\n\\nAmericans are no longer innocent until proven guilty. We once operated under the assumption that you were innocent until proven guilty. Due in large part to rapid advances in technology and a heightened surveillance culture, the burden of proof has been shifted so that the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty has been usurped by a new norm in which all citizens are suspects. This is exemplified by police practices of stopping and frisking people who are merely walking down the street and where there is no evidence of wrongdoing. Likewise, by subjecting Americans to full-body scans and license-plate readers without their knowledge or compliance and then storing the scans for later use, the government\\u2014in cahoots with the corporate state\\u2014has erected the ultimate suspect society. In such an environment, we are all potentially guilty of some wrongdoing or other.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to self-defense. In the wake of various shootings in recent years, \\u201cgun control\\u201d has become a resounding theme. Those advocating gun reform see the Second Amendment\\u2019s right to bear arms as applying only to government officials. As a result, even Americans who legally own firearms are being treated with suspicion and, in some cases, undue violence. In one case, a Texas man had his home subjected to a no-knock raid and was shot in his bed after police, attempting to deliver a routine search warrant, learned that he was in legal possession of a firearm. In another incident, a Florida man who was licensed to carry a concealed firearm found himself detained for two hours during a routine traffic stop in Maryland while the arresting officer searched his vehicle in vain for the man\\u2019s gun, which he had left at home. Incidentally, the Trump Administration has done more to crack down on Second Amendment rights than anything the Obama Administration ever managed.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to private property. If government agents can invade your home, break down your doors, kill your dog, damage your furnishings and terrorize your family, your property is no longer private and secure\\u2014it belongs to the government. Likewise, if government officials can fine and arrest you for growing vegetables in your front yard, praying with friends in your living room, installing solar panels on your roof, and raising chickens in your backyard, you\\u2019re no longer the owner of your property.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a say about what their children are exposed to in school. Incredibly, the government continues to insist that parents essentially forfeit their rights when they send their children to a public school. This growing tension over whether young people, especially those in the public schools, are essentially wards of the state, to do with as government officials deem appropriate, in defiance of the children\\u2019s constitutional rights and those of their parents, is reflected in the debate over sex education programs that expose young people to all manner of sexual practices and terminology, zero tolerance policies that strip students of any due process rights, let alone parental involvement in school discipline, and Common Core programs that teach students to be test-takers rather than critical thinkers.\\n\\nAmericans are powerless in the face of militarized police. In early America, citizens were considered equals with law enforcement officials. Authorities were rarely permitted to enter one\\u2019s home without permission or in a deceitful manner. And it was not uncommon for police officers to be held personally liable for trespass when they wrongfully invaded a citizen\\u2019s home.

The U.S. Supreme Court was intended to be an institution established to intervene and protect the people against the government and its agents when they overstep their bounds. Yet through their deference to police power, preference for security over freedom, and evisceration of our most basic rights for the sake of order and expediency, the justices of the Supreme Court have become the architects of the American police state in which we now live, while the lower courts have appointed themselves courts of order, concerned primarily with advancing the government\\u2019s agenda, no matter how unjust or illegal.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a representative government. We have moved beyond the era of representative government and entered a new age, let\\u2019s call it the age of authoritarianism. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called \\u201ceconomic elite.\\u201d Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. It is not overstating matters to say that Congress, which has done its best to keep their unhappy constituents at a distance, may well be the most self-serving, semi-corrupt institution in America.\\n\\nIn other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism: a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. Rest assured that when and if fascism finally takes hold in America, the basic forms of government will remain: Fascism will appear to be friendly. The legislators will be in session. There will be elections, and the news media will continue to cover the entertainment and political trivia. Consent of the governed, however, will no longer apply. Actual control will have finally passed to the oligarchic elite controlling the government behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Clearly, we are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests. We have moved into \\u201ccorporatism\\u201d (favored by Benito Mussolini), which is a halfway point on the road to full-blown fascism. Corporatism is where the few moneyed interests\\u2014not elected by the citizenry\\u2014rule over the many.\\n\\nHistory may show that from this point forward, we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a totalitarian state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom. Even with its constantly shifting terrain, this topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America\\u2019s new normal. From Clinton to Bush, then Obama and now Trump, it\\u2019s as if we\\u2019ve been caught in a time loop, forced to re-live the same thing over and over again: the same assaults on our freedoms, the same disregard for the rule of law, the same subservience to the Deep State, and the same corrupt, self-serving government that exists only to amass power, enrich its shareholders and ensure its continued domination.\\n\\nElections will not save us.\\n\\nI haven\\u2019t even touched on the corporate state, the military industrial complex, SWAT team raids, invasive surveillance technology, zero tolerance policies in the schools, overcriminalization, or privatized prisons, to name just a few, but what I have touched on should be enough to show that the landscape of our freedoms has already changed dramatically from what it once was and will no doubt continue to deteriorate unless Americans can find a way to wrest back control of their government and reclaim their freedoms.\\n\\nThere can be no denying that the world is indeed a dangerous place, but what the president and his cohorts fail to acknowledge is that it\\u2019s the government that poses the gravest threat to our freedoms and way of life, and no amount of politicking, parsing or pandering will change that.\\n\\nIt is easy to be diverted, distracted and amused by the antics of politicians, the pomp and circumstance of awards shows, athletic events, and entertainment news, and the feel-good, wrapped-in-the-flag evangelism that passes for religion today.\\n\\nWhat is far more difficult to face up to is the reality of life in America, where unemployment, poverty, inequality, injustice and violence by government agents are increasingly norms, and where \\u201cwe the people\\u201d are at a distinct disadvantage in the face of the government elite\\u2019s power grabs, greed and firepower.\\n\\nThe Constitution doesn\\u2019t stand a chance against a federalized, globalized standing army protected by legislative, judicial and executive branches that are all on the same side, no matter what political views they subscribe to: suffice it to say, they are not on our side or the side of freedom.\\n\\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the powers-that-be want us to remain distracted, divided, alienated from each other based on our politics, our bank accounts, our religion, our race and our value systems.

The U.S. government.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve been losing our freedoms so incrementally for so long\\u2014sold to us in the name of national security and global peace, maintained by way of martial law disguised as law and order, and enforced by a standing army of militarized police and a political elite determined to maintain their powers at all costs\\u2014that it\\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when it all started going downhill, but we\\u2019re certainly on that downward trajectory now, and things are moving fast.\\n\\nThe Deep State\\u2019s plot to take over America has succeeded.\\n\\nThe American system of representative government has been overthrown by a profit-driven, militaristic, corporate oligarchy bent on total control and global domination through the imposition of martial law here at home and by fomenting wars abroad.\\n\\nEven now, we are being pushed and prodded towards a civil war, not because the American people are so divided but because that\\u2019s how corrupt governments control a populace (i.e., divide and conquer).\\n\\nThese are indeed dangerous times but not because of violent crime, which remains at an all-time low, or because of terrorism, which is statistically rare, or because the borders are being invaded by foreign armies, which data reports from the Department of Homeland Security refute.\\n\\nNo, the real danger that we face comes from none other than the U.S. government and the powers it has granted to its standing armies to rob, steal, cheat, harass, detain, brutalize, terrorize, torture and kill American citizens with immunity.\\n\\nThe danger \\u201cwe the people\\u201d face comes from masked invaders on the government payroll who crash through our doors in the dark of night, shoot our dogs, and terrorize our families.\\n\\nThis danger comes from militarized henchmen on the government payroll who demand absolute obedience, instill abject fear, and shoot first and ask questions later.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy, power-hungry bureaucrats on the government payroll who have little to no understanding of their constitutional limits.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy politicians and corporations for whom profit trumps principle.\\n\\nYou want to know about the state of our union? It\\u2019s downright scary.\\n\\nConsider, if you will, all of the dastardly, devious, diabolical, dangerous, debilitating, deceitful, dehumanizing, demonic, depraved, dishonorable, disillusioning, discriminatory, dictatorial schemes inflicted on \\u201cwe the people\\u201d by a bureaucratic, totalitarian regime that has long since ceased to be \\u201ca government of the people, by the people and for the people.\\u201d\\n\\nAmericans have no protection against police abuse. It is no longer unusual to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals first and ask questions later, such as the 16-year-old teenager who skipped school only to be shot by police after they mistook him for a fleeing burglar. Then there was the unarmed black man in Texas \\u201cwho was pursued and shot in the back of the neck by Austin Police\\u2026 after failing to properly identify himself and leaving the scene of an unrelated incident.\\u201d And who could forget the 19-year-old Seattle woman who was accidentally shot in the leg by police after she refused to show her hands? What is increasingly common, however, is the news that the officers involved in these incidents get off with little more than a slap on the hands.\\n\\nAmericans are little more than pocketbooks to fund the police state. If there is any absolute maxim by which the federal government seems to operate, it is that the American taxpayer always gets ripped off. This is true, whether you\\u2019re talking about taxpayers being forced to fund high-priced weaponry that will be used against us, endless wars that do little for our safety or our freedoms, or bloated government agencies such as the National Security Agency with its secret budgets, covert agendas and clandestine activities. Rubbing salt in the wound, even monetary awards in lawsuits against government officials who are found guilty of wrongdoing are paid by the taxpayer.\\n\\nAmericans are no longer innocent until proven guilty. We once operated under the assumption that you were innocent until proven guilty. Due in large part to rapid advances in technology and a heightened surveillance culture, the burden of proof has been shifted so that the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty has been usurped by a new norm in which all citizens are suspects. This is exemplified by police practices of stopping and frisking people who are merely walking down the street and where there is no evidence of wrongdoing. Likewise, by subjecting Americans to full-body scans and license-plate readers without their knowledge or compliance and then storing the scans for later use, the government\\u2014in cahoots with the corporate state\\u2014has erected the ultimate suspect society. In such an environment, we are all potentially guilty of some wrongdoing or other.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to self-defense. In the wake of various shootings in recent years, \\u201cgun control\\u201d has become a resounding theme. Those advocating gun reform see the Second Amendment\\u2019s right to bear arms as applying only to government officials. As a result, even Americans who legally own firearms are being treated with suspicion and, in some cases, undue violence. In one case, a Texas man had his home subjected to a no-knock raid and was shot in his bed after police, attempting to deliver a routine search warrant, learned that he was in legal possession of a firearm. In another incident, a Florida man who was licensed to carry a concealed firearm found himself detained for two hours during a routine traffic stop in Maryland while the arresting officer searched his vehicle in vain for the man\\u2019s gun, which he had left at home. Incidentally, the Trump Administration has done more to crack down on Second Amendment rights than anything the Obama Administration ever managed.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to private property. If government agents can invade your home, break down your doors, kill your dog, damage your furnishings and terrorize your family, your property is no longer private and secure\\u2014it belongs to the government. Likewise, if government officials can fine and arrest you for growing vegetables in your front yard, praying with friends in your living room, installing solar panels on your roof, and raising chickens in your backyard, you\\u2019re no longer the owner of your property.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a say about what their children are exposed to in school. Incredibly, the government continues to insist that parents essentially forfeit their rights when they send their children to a public school. This growing tension over whether young people, especially those in the public schools, are essentially wards of the state, to do with as government officials deem appropriate, in defiance of the children\\u2019s constitutional rights and those of their parents, is reflected in the debate over sex education programs that expose young people to all manner of sexual practices and terminology, zero tolerance policies that strip students of any due process rights, let alone parental involvement in school discipline, and Common Core programs that teach students to be test-takers rather than critical thinkers.\\n\\nAmericans are powerless in the face of militarized police. In early America, citizens were considered equals with law enforcement officials. Authorities were rarely permitted to enter one\\u2019s home without permission or in a deceitful manner. And it was not uncommon for police officers to be held personally liable for trespass when they wrongfully invaded a citizen\\u2019s home. Unlike today, early Americans could resist arrest when a police officer tried to restrain them without proper justification or a warrant\\u2014which the police had to allow citizens to read before arresting them. (Daring to dispute a warrant with a police official today who is armed with high-tech military weapons and tasers would be nothing short of suicidal.) As police forces across the country continue to be transformed into outposts of the military, with police agencies acquiring military-grade hardware in droves, Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts, complete with tanks, weaponry, and other equipment designed for the battlefield.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to bodily integrity. Court rulings undermining the Fourth Amendment and justifying invasive strip searches have left us powerless against police empowered to forcefully draw our blood, strip search us, and probe us intimately. Accounts are on the rise of individuals\\u2014men and women\\u2014being subjected to what is essentially government-sanctioned rape by police in the course of \\u201croutine\\u201d traffic stops.

Yet through their deference to police power, preference for security over freedom, and evisceration of our most basic rights for the sake of order and expediency, the justices of the Supreme Court have become the architects of the American police state in which we now live, while the lower courts have appointed themselves courts of order, concerned primarily with advancing the government\\u2019s agenda, no matter how unjust or illegal.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a representative government. We have moved beyond the era of representative government and entered a new age, let\\u2019s call it the age of authoritarianism. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called \\u201ceconomic elite.\\u201d Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. It is not overstating matters to say that Congress, which has done its best to keep their unhappy constituents at a distance, may well be the most self-serving, semi-corrupt institution in America.\\n\\nIn other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism: a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. Rest assured that when and if fascism finally takes hold in America, the basic forms of government will remain: Fascism will appear to be friendly. The legislators will be in session. There will be elections, and the news media will continue to cover the entertainment and political trivia. Consent of the governed, however, will no longer apply. Actual control will have finally passed to the oligarchic elite controlling the government behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Clearly, we are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests. We have moved into \\u201ccorporatism\\u201d (favored by Benito Mussolini), which is a halfway point on the road to full-blown fascism. Corporatism is where the few moneyed interests\\u2014not elected by the citizenry\\u2014rule over the many.\\n\\nHistory may show that from this point forward, we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a totalitarian state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom. Even with its constantly shifting terrain, this topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America\\u2019s new normal. From Clinton to Bush, then Obama and now Trump, it\\u2019s as if we\\u2019ve been caught in a time loop, forced to re-live the same thing over and over again: the same assaults on our freedoms, the same disregard for the rule of law, the same subservience to the Deep State, and the same corrupt, self-serving government that exists only to amass power, enrich its shareholders and ensure its continued domination.\\n\\nElections will not save us.\\n\\nI haven\\u2019t even touched on the corporate state, the military industrial complex, SWAT team raids, invasive surveillance technology, zero tolerance policies in the schools, overcriminalization, or privatized prisons, to name just a few, but what I have touched on should be enough to show that the landscape of our freedoms has already changed dramatically from what it once was and will no doubt continue to deteriorate unless Americans can find a way to wrest back control of their government and reclaim their freedoms.\\n\\nThere can be no denying that the world is indeed a dangerous place, but what the president and his cohorts fail to acknowledge is that it\\u2019s the government that poses the gravest threat to our freedoms and way of life, and no amount of politicking, parsing or pandering will change that.\\n\\nIt is easy to be diverted, distracted and amused by the antics of politicians, the pomp and circumstance of awards shows, athletic events, and entertainment news, and the feel-good, wrapped-in-the-flag evangelism that passes for religion today.\\n\\nWhat is far more difficult to face up to is the reality of life in America, where unemployment, poverty, inequality, injustice and violence by government agents are increasingly norms, and where \\u201cwe the people\\u201d are at a distinct disadvantage in the face of the government elite\\u2019s power grabs, greed and firepower.\\n\\nThe Constitution doesn\\u2019t stand a chance against a federalized, globalized standing army protected by legislative, judicial and executive branches that are all on the same side, no matter what political views they subscribe to: suffice it to say, they are not on our side or the side of freedom.\\n\\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the powers-that-be want us to remain distracted, divided, alienated from each other based on our politics, our bank accounts, our religion, our race and our value systems. Yet as George Orwell observed, \\u201cThe real division is not between conservatives and revolutionaries but between authoritarians and libertarians.\\u201d\\n\\nYou either believe in freedom or you don\\u2019t. It\\u2019s that simple.\\n\\nEverything else is just a deadly distraction.

The U.S. government.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve been losing our freedoms so incrementally for so long\\u2014sold to us in the name of national security and global peace, maintained by way of martial law disguised as law and order, and enforced by a standing army of militarized police and a political elite determined to maintain their powers at all costs\\u2014that it\\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when it all started going downhill, but we\\u2019re certainly on that downward trajectory now, and things are moving fast.\\n\\nThe Deep State\\u2019s plot to take over America has succeeded.\\n\\nThe American system of representative government has been overthrown by a profit-driven, militaristic, corporate oligarchy bent on total control and global domination through the imposition of martial law here at home and by fomenting wars abroad.\\n\\nEven now, we are being pushed and prodded towards a civil war, not because the American people are so divided but because that\\u2019s how corrupt governments control a populace (i.e., divide and conquer).\\n\\nThese are indeed dangerous times but not because of violent crime, which remains at an all-time low, or because of terrorism, which is statistically rare, or because the borders are being invaded by foreign armies, which data reports from the Department of Homeland Security refute.\\n\\nNo, the real danger that we face comes from none other than the U.S. government and the powers it has granted to its standing armies to rob, steal, cheat, harass, detain, brutalize, terrorize, torture and kill American citizens with immunity.\\n\\nThe danger \\u201cwe the people\\u201d face comes from masked invaders on the government payroll who crash through our doors in the dark of night, shoot our dogs, and terrorize our families.\\n\\nThis danger comes from militarized henchmen on the government payroll who demand absolute obedience, instill abject fear, and shoot first and ask questions later.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy, power-hungry bureaucrats on the government payroll who have little to no understanding of their constitutional limits.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy politicians and corporations for whom profit trumps principle.\\n\\nYou want to know about the state of our union? It\\u2019s downright scary.\\n\\nConsider, if you will, all of the dastardly, devious, diabolical, dangerous, debilitating, deceitful, dehumanizing, demonic, depraved, dishonorable, disillusioning, discriminatory, dictatorial schemes inflicted on \\u201cwe the people\\u201d by a bureaucratic, totalitarian regime that has long since ceased to be \\u201ca government of the people, by the people and for the people.\\u201d\\n\\nAmericans have no protection against police abuse. It is no longer unusual to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals first and ask questions later, such as the 16-year-old teenager who skipped school only to be shot by police after they mistook him for a fleeing burglar. Then there was the unarmed black man in Texas \\u201cwho was pursued and shot in the back of the neck by Austin Police\\u2026 after failing to properly identify himself and leaving the scene of an unrelated incident.\\u201d And who could forget the 19-year-old Seattle woman who was accidentally shot in the leg by police after she refused to show her hands? What is increasingly common, however, is the news that the officers involved in these incidents get off with little more than a slap on the hands.\\n\\nAmericans are little more than pocketbooks to fund the police state. If there is any absolute maxim by which the federal government seems to operate, it is that the American taxpayer always gets ripped off. This is true, whether you\\u2019re talking about taxpayers being forced to fund high-priced weaponry that will be used against us, endless wars that do little for our safety or our freedoms, or bloated government agencies such as the National Security Agency with its secret budgets, covert agendas and clandestine activities. Rubbing salt in the wound, even monetary awards in lawsuits against government officials who are found guilty of wrongdoing are paid by the taxpayer.\\n\\nAmericans are no longer innocent until proven guilty. We once operated under the assumption that you were innocent until proven guilty. Due in large part to rapid advances in technology and a heightened surveillance culture, the burden of proof has been shifted so that the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty has been usurped by a new norm in which all citizens are suspects. This is exemplified by police practices of stopping and frisking people who are merely walking down the street and where there is no evidence of wrongdoing. Likewise, by subjecting Americans to full-body scans and license-plate readers without their knowledge or compliance and then storing the scans for later use, the government\\u2014in cahoots with the corporate state\\u2014has erected the ultimate suspect society. In such an environment, we are all potentially guilty of some wrongdoing or other.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to self-defense. In the wake of various shootings in recent years, \\u201cgun control\\u201d has become a resounding theme. Those advocating gun reform see the Second Amendment\\u2019s right to bear arms as applying only to government officials. As a result, even Americans who legally own firearms are being treated with suspicion and, in some cases, undue violence. In one case, a Texas man had his home subjected to a no-knock raid and was shot in his bed after police, attempting to deliver a routine search warrant, learned that he was in legal possession of a firearm. In another incident, a Florida man who was licensed to carry a concealed firearm found himself detained for two hours during a routine traffic stop in Maryland while the arresting officer searched his vehicle in vain for the man\\u2019s gun, which he had left at home. Incidentally, the Trump Administration has done more to crack down on Second Amendment rights than anything the Obama Administration ever managed.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to private property. If government agents can invade your home, break down your doors, kill your dog, damage your furnishings and terrorize your family, your property is no longer private and secure\\u2014it belongs to the government. Likewise, if government officials can fine and arrest you for growing vegetables in your front yard, praying with friends in your living room, installing solar panels on your roof, and raising chickens in your backyard, you\\u2019re no longer the owner of your property.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a say about what their children are exposed to in school. Incredibly, the government continues to insist that parents essentially forfeit their rights when they send their children to a public school. This growing tension over whether young people, especially those in the public schools, are essentially wards of the state, to do with as government officials deem appropriate, in defiance of the children\\u2019s constitutional rights and those of their parents, is reflected in the debate over sex education programs that expose young people to all manner of sexual practices and terminology, zero tolerance policies that strip students of any due process rights, let alone parental involvement in school discipline, and Common Core programs that teach students to be test-takers rather than critical thinkers.\\n\\nAmericans are powerless in the face of militarized police. In early America, citizens were considered equals with law enforcement officials. Authorities were rarely permitted to enter one\\u2019s home without permission or in a deceitful manner. And it was not uncommon for police officers to be held personally liable for trespass when they wrongfully invaded a citizen\\u2019s home. Unlike today, early Americans could resist arrest when a police officer tried to restrain them without proper justification or a warrant\\u2014which the police had to allow citizens to read before arresting them. (Daring to dispute a warrant with a police official today who is armed with high-tech military weapons and tasers would be nothing short of suicidal.) As police forces across the country continue to be transformed into outposts of the military, with police agencies acquiring military-grade hardware in droves, Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts, complete with tanks, weaponry, and other equipment designed for the battlefield.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to bodily integrity. Court rulings undermining the Fourth Amendment and justifying invasive strip searches have left us powerless against police empowered to forcefully draw our blood, strip search us, and probe us intimately. Accounts are on the rise of individuals\\u2014men and women\\u2014being subjected to what is essentially government-sanctioned rape by police in the course of \\u201croutine\\u201d traffic stops. Remember the New Mexico man who was subjected to a 12-hour ordeal of anal probes, X-rays, enemas, and finally a colonoscopy\\u2014all because he allegedly rolled through a stop sign?\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to the expectation of privacy. Despite the staggering number of revelations about government spying on Americans\\u2019 phone calls, Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, Google searches, emails, bookstore and grocery purchases, bank statements, commuter toll records, etc., Congress, the president and the courts have done little to nothing to counteract these abuses. Instead, they seem determined to accustom us to life in this electronic concentration camp.\\n\\nAmericans can no longer rely on the courts to mete out justice.

Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called \\u201ceconomic elite.\\u201d Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. It is not overstating matters to say that Congress, which has done its best to keep their unhappy constituents at a distance, may well be the most self-serving, semi-corrupt institution in America.\\n\\nIn other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism: a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. Rest assured that when and if fascism finally takes hold in America, the basic forms of government will remain: Fascism will appear to be friendly. The legislators will be in session. There will be elections, and the news media will continue to cover the entertainment and political trivia. Consent of the governed, however, will no longer apply. Actual control will have finally passed to the oligarchic elite controlling the government behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Clearly, we are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests. We have moved into \\u201ccorporatism\\u201d (favored by Benito Mussolini), which is a halfway point on the road to full-blown fascism. Corporatism is where the few moneyed interests\\u2014not elected by the citizenry\\u2014rule over the many.\\n\\nHistory may show that from this point forward, we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a totalitarian state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom. Even with its constantly shifting terrain, this topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America\\u2019s new normal. From Clinton to Bush, then Obama and now Trump, it\\u2019s as if we\\u2019ve been caught in a time loop, forced to re-live the same thing over and over again: the same assaults on our freedoms, the same disregard for the rule of law, the same subservience to the Deep State, and the same corrupt, self-serving government that exists only to amass power, enrich its shareholders and ensure its continued domination.\\n\\nElections will not save us.\\n\\nI haven\\u2019t even touched on the corporate state, the military industrial complex, SWAT team raids, invasive surveillance technology, zero tolerance policies in the schools, overcriminalization, or privatized prisons, to name just a few, but what I have touched on should be enough to show that the landscape of our freedoms has already changed dramatically from what it once was and will no doubt continue to deteriorate unless Americans can find a way to wrest back control of their government and reclaim their freedoms.\\n\\nThere can be no denying that the world is indeed a dangerous place, but what the president and his cohorts fail to acknowledge is that it\\u2019s the government that poses the gravest threat to our freedoms and way of life, and no amount of politicking, parsing or pandering will change that.\\n\\nIt is easy to be diverted, distracted and amused by the antics of politicians, the pomp and circumstance of awards shows, athletic events, and entertainment news, and the feel-good, wrapped-in-the-flag evangelism that passes for religion today.\\n\\nWhat is far more difficult to face up to is the reality of life in America, where unemployment, poverty, inequality, injustice and violence by government agents are increasingly norms, and where \\u201cwe the people\\u201d are at a distinct disadvantage in the face of the government elite\\u2019s power grabs, greed and firepower.\\n\\nThe Constitution doesn\\u2019t stand a chance against a federalized, globalized standing army protected by legislative, judicial and executive branches that are all on the same side, no matter what political views they subscribe to: suffice it to say, they are not on our side or the side of freedom.\\n\\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the powers-that-be want us to remain distracted, divided, alienated from each other based on our politics, our bank accounts, our religion, our race and our value systems. Yet as George Orwell observed, \\u201cThe real division is not between conservatives and revolutionaries but between authoritarians and libertarians.\\u201d\\n\\nYou either believe in freedom or you don\\u2019t. It\\u2019s that simple.\\n\\nEverything else is just a deadly distraction.

The U.S. government.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve been losing our freedoms so incrementally for so long\\u2014sold to us in the name of national security and global peace, maintained by way of martial law disguised as law and order, and enforced by a standing army of militarized police and a political elite determined to maintain their powers at all costs\\u2014that it\\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when it all started going downhill, but we\\u2019re certainly on that downward trajectory now, and things are moving fast.\\n\\nThe Deep State\\u2019s plot to take over America has succeeded.\\n\\nThe American system of representative government has been overthrown by a profit-driven, militaristic, corporate oligarchy bent on total control and global domination through the imposition of martial law here at home and by fomenting wars abroad.\\n\\nEven now, we are being pushed and prodded towards a civil war, not because the American people are so divided but because that\\u2019s how corrupt governments control a populace (i.e., divide and conquer).\\n\\nThese are indeed dangerous times but not because of violent crime, which remains at an all-time low, or because of terrorism, which is statistically rare, or because the borders are being invaded by foreign armies, which data reports from the Department of Homeland Security refute.\\n\\nNo, the real danger that we face comes from none other than the U.S. government and the powers it has granted to its standing armies to rob, steal, cheat, harass, detain, brutalize, terrorize, torture and kill American citizens with immunity.\\n\\nThe danger \\u201cwe the people\\u201d face comes from masked invaders on the government payroll who crash through our doors in the dark of night, shoot our dogs, and terrorize our families.\\n\\nThis danger comes from militarized henchmen on the government payroll who demand absolute obedience, instill abject fear, and shoot first and ask questions later.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy, power-hungry bureaucrats on the government payroll who have little to no understanding of their constitutional limits.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy politicians and corporations for whom profit trumps principle.\\n\\nYou want to know about the state of our union? It\\u2019s downright scary.\\n\\nConsider, if you will, all of the dastardly, devious, diabolical, dangerous, debilitating, deceitful, dehumanizing, demonic, depraved, dishonorable, disillusioning, discriminatory, dictatorial schemes inflicted on \\u201cwe the people\\u201d by a bureaucratic, totalitarian regime that has long since ceased to be \\u201ca government of the people, by the people and for the people.\\u201d\\n\\nAmericans have no protection against police abuse. It is no longer unusual to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals first and ask questions later, such as the 16-year-old teenager who skipped school only to be shot by police after they mistook him for a fleeing burglar. Then there was the unarmed black man in Texas \\u201cwho was pursued and shot in the back of the neck by Austin Police\\u2026 after failing to properly identify himself and leaving the scene of an unrelated incident.\\u201d And who could forget the 19-year-old Seattle woman who was accidentally shot in the leg by police after she refused to show her hands? What is increasingly common, however, is the news that the officers involved in these incidents get off with little more than a slap on the hands.\\n\\nAmericans are little more than pocketbooks to fund the police state. If there is any absolute maxim by which the federal government seems to operate, it is that the American taxpayer always gets ripped off. This is true, whether you\\u2019re talking about taxpayers being forced to fund high-priced weaponry that will be used against us, endless wars that do little for our safety or our freedoms, or bloated government agencies such as the National Security Agency with its secret budgets, covert agendas and clandestine activities. Rubbing salt in the wound, even monetary awards in lawsuits against government officials who are found guilty of wrongdoing are paid by the taxpayer.\\n\\nAmericans are no longer innocent until proven guilty. We once operated under the assumption that you were innocent until proven guilty. Due in large part to rapid advances in technology and a heightened surveillance culture, the burden of proof has been shifted so that the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty has been usurped by a new norm in which all citizens are suspects. This is exemplified by police practices of stopping and frisking people who are merely walking down the street and where there is no evidence of wrongdoing. Likewise, by subjecting Americans to full-body scans and license-plate readers without their knowledge or compliance and then storing the scans for later use, the government\\u2014in cahoots with the corporate state\\u2014has erected the ultimate suspect society. In such an environment, we are all potentially guilty of some wrongdoing or other.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to self-defense. In the wake of various shootings in recent years, \\u201cgun control\\u201d has become a resounding theme. Those advocating gun reform see the Second Amendment\\u2019s right to bear arms as applying only to government officials. As a result, even Americans who legally own firearms are being treated with suspicion and, in some cases, undue violence. In one case, a Texas man had his home subjected to a no-knock raid and was shot in his bed after police, attempting to deliver a routine search warrant, learned that he was in legal possession of a firearm. In another incident, a Florida man who was licensed to carry a concealed firearm found himself detained for two hours during a routine traffic stop in Maryland while the arresting officer searched his vehicle in vain for the man\\u2019s gun, which he had left at home. Incidentally, the Trump Administration has done more to crack down on Second Amendment rights than anything the Obama Administration ever managed.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to private property. If government agents can invade your home, break down your doors, kill your dog, damage your furnishings and terrorize your family, your property is no longer private and secure\\u2014it belongs to the government. Likewise, if government officials can fine and arrest you for growing vegetables in your front yard, praying with friends in your living room, installing solar panels on your roof, and raising chickens in your backyard, you\\u2019re no longer the owner of your property.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a say about what their children are exposed to in school. Incredibly, the government continues to insist that parents essentially forfeit their rights when they send their children to a public school. This growing tension over whether young people, especially those in the public schools, are essentially wards of the state, to do with as government officials deem appropriate, in defiance of the children\\u2019s constitutional rights and those of their parents, is reflected in the debate over sex education programs that expose young people to all manner of sexual practices and terminology, zero tolerance policies that strip students of any due process rights, let alone parental involvement in school discipline, and Common Core programs that teach students to be test-takers rather than critical thinkers.\\n\\nAmericans are powerless in the face of militarized police. In early America, citizens were considered equals with law enforcement officials. Authorities were rarely permitted to enter one\\u2019s home without permission or in a deceitful manner. And it was not uncommon for police officers to be held personally liable for trespass when they wrongfully invaded a citizen\\u2019s home. Unlike today, early Americans could resist arrest when a police officer tried to restrain them without proper justification or a warrant\\u2014which the police had to allow citizens to read before arresting them. (Daring to dispute a warrant with a police official today who is armed with high-tech military weapons and tasers would be nothing short of suicidal.) As police forces across the country continue to be transformed into outposts of the military, with police agencies acquiring military-grade hardware in droves, Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts, complete with tanks, weaponry, and other equipment designed for the battlefield.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to bodily integrity. Court rulings undermining the Fourth Amendment and justifying invasive strip searches have left us powerless against police empowered to forcefully draw our blood, strip search us, and probe us intimately. Accounts are on the rise of individuals\\u2014men and women\\u2014being subjected to what is essentially government-sanctioned rape by police in the course of \\u201croutine\\u201d traffic stops. Remember the New Mexico man who was subjected to a 12-hour ordeal of anal probes, X-rays, enemas, and finally a colonoscopy\\u2014all because he allegedly rolled through a stop sign?\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to the expectation of privacy. Despite the staggering number of revelations about government spying on Americans\\u2019 phone calls, Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, Google searches, emails, bookstore and grocery purchases, bank statements, commuter toll records, etc., Congress, the president and the courts have done little to nothing to counteract these abuses. Instead, they seem determined to accustom us to life in this electronic concentration camp.\\n\\nAmericans can no longer rely on the courts to mete out justice. The U.S. Supreme Court was intended to be an institution established to intervene and protect the people against the government and its agents when they overstep their bounds. Yet through their deference to police power, preference for security over freedom, and evisceration of our most basic rights for the sake of order and expediency, the justices of the Supreme Court have become the architects of the American police state in which we now live, while the lower courts have appointed themselves courts of order, concerned primarily with advancing the government\\u2019s agenda, no matter how unjust or illegal.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a representative government. We have moved beyond the era of representative government and entered a new age, let\\u2019s call it the age of authoritarianism.

There will be elections, and the news media will continue to cover the entertainment and political trivia. Consent of the governed, however, will no longer apply. Actual control will have finally passed to the oligarchic elite controlling the government behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Clearly, we are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests. We have moved into \\u201ccorporatism\\u201d (favored by Benito Mussolini), which is a halfway point on the road to full-blown fascism. Corporatism is where the few moneyed interests\\u2014not elected by the citizenry\\u2014rule over the many.\\n\\nHistory may show that from this point forward, we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a totalitarian state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom. Even with its constantly shifting terrain, this topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America\\u2019s new normal. From Clinton to Bush, then Obama and now Trump, it\\u2019s as if we\\u2019ve been caught in a time loop, forced to re-live the same thing over and over again: the same assaults on our freedoms, the same disregard for the rule of law, the same subservience to the Deep State, and the same corrupt, self-serving government that exists only to amass power, enrich its shareholders and ensure its continued domination.\\n\\nElections will not save us.\\n\\nI haven\\u2019t even touched on the corporate state, the military industrial complex, SWAT team raids, invasive surveillance technology, zero tolerance policies in the schools, overcriminalization, or privatized prisons, to name just a few, but what I have touched on should be enough to show that the landscape of our freedoms has already changed dramatically from what it once was and will no doubt continue to deteriorate unless Americans can find a way to wrest back control of their government and reclaim their freedoms.\\n\\nThere can be no denying that the world is indeed a dangerous place, but what the president and his cohorts fail to acknowledge is that it\\u2019s the government that poses the gravest threat to our freedoms and way of life, and no amount of politicking, parsing or pandering will change that.\\n\\nIt is easy to be diverted, distracted and amused by the antics of politicians, the pomp and circumstance of awards shows, athletic events, and entertainment news, and the feel-good, wrapped-in-the-flag evangelism that passes for religion today.\\n\\nWhat is far more difficult to face up to is the reality of life in America, where unemployment, poverty, inequality, injustice and violence by government agents are increasingly norms, and where \\u201cwe the people\\u201d are at a distinct disadvantage in the face of the government elite\\u2019s power grabs, greed and firepower.\\n\\nThe Constitution doesn\\u2019t stand a chance against a federalized, globalized standing army protected by legislative, judicial and executive branches that are all on the same side, no matter what political views they subscribe to: suffice it to say, they are not on our side or the side of freedom.\\n\\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the powers-that-be want us to remain distracted, divided, alienated from each other based on our politics, our bank accounts, our religion, our race and our value systems. Yet as George Orwell observed, \\u201cThe real division is not between conservatives and revolutionaries but between authoritarians and libertarians.\\u201d\\n\\nYou either believe in freedom or you don\\u2019t. It\\u2019s that simple.\\n\\nEverything else is just a deadly distraction.

The forum\\u2019s own social mobility index ranks the United States 27th in the world, behind Estonia, Lithuania, and Singapore. The bottom half of Americans own just 1.6 percent of the nation\\u2019s wealth, up from 1.1 percent when President Trump took office but down from 2.1 percent in 2006 \\u2014 and that group is largely untouched by stock market gains. And while wages have started rising faster for lower-income earners, they have a wide chasm to close with those at the top:\\n\\nThe divergent prospects for the narrowest slice of winners in the U.S. economy and the rest of the population were on stark display in Davos this week. And they point to a challenge for President Trump as he swaps out his 2016 campaign promise to restore the fortunes of what he called \\\"the forgotten man\\\" for a message that claims victory and defends the status quo.\\n\\nAddressing the global elite at the Swiss conclave, Trump called the U.S. economy the \\u201cgreatest economy we\\u2019ve ever had in the history of our country,\\u201d one that is \\u201cno longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few.\\u201d\\n\\nThe data support neither claim. (Growth topped 4 percent for four straight years during the 1990s, for example, while under Trump, the economy has yet to record a full year of growth above 3 percent.) More significantly, though, Trump's position ignores the structural problems exacerbating the spread between the haves and have-nots, which are primed to throttle future growth. \\u201cInequality generally has deteriorated everywhere, but it is still the case that the U.S. is by far the most unequal country in the world in terms of income distribution and wealth distribution,\\u201d Deutsche Bank Securities chief economist Torsten Slok said in a podcast interview from Davos.\\n\\nWealth has indeed piled up in the United States since the financial crisis as stock and home prices have risen. But as Slok explains, contrary to Trump\\u2019s claim, it \\u201chas been concentrated in fewer hands.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s correct that stock prices have gone up and home prices have gone up,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat has benefited those who own stocks and those who own homes. But unfortunately it\\u2019s fewer and fewer people who own stocks and fewer and fewer people who own homes. So that means inequality has actually been increasing even though we have seen this increase in stock prices and home prices.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd because wealthier people have less of a tendency to spend extra money they pull in, as they get richer, the consumption that supports most economic activity remains stagnant. \\u201cIt means that growth is probably going to be on the weaker side,\\\" Slok says.\\n\\nThat risk is front and center for economists, according to Saadia Zahidi, the WEF\\u2019s managing director. \\u201cWe did a chief economist outlook a couple weeks ago, and one of the biggest threats to global growth over the coming year is likely to be the economically-motivated social protest that we\\u2019re seeing,\\u201d she told Bloomberg TV. And Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell has called inequality the greatest threat to the U.S. economy over the next decade.\\n\\nBut financiers aren\\u2019t registering the same alarm. They are advising investors to boost their exposure to the market. \\u201cCash is trash,\\u201d Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world, told CNBC. \\u201cGet out of cash.\\u201d Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones agreed: \\u201cThe train has got a long, long way to go if you think about it,\\u201d he told the network.\\n\\nAnd JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, while declining to discuss 2020 candidates by name, issued a warning about the dangers of socialism that appeared aimed at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has been rising in the Democratic primary polls for president. Socialist governments, he said, produce \\\"an eroding society... They do need to fix inner-city schools, infrastructure, health care. We can fix all of those in a capitalist society.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd Andrew Ross Sorkin, who helped conduct the CNBC interview with Dimon, weighed in to fact-check Sanders:\\n\\n\\u2014 Wuhan quarantine expands as coronavirus spreads. The Post's Anna Fifield: \\\"The central Chinese city of Wuhan pulsated with fear and anger Thursday, as 11 million people awoke to news that they were being confined to a metropolis-sized quarantine zone designed to contain a widening coronavirus outbreak. The quarantine is also spreading, with nearby Huanggang and Ezhou announcing they were shutting down travel networks, effectively confining some 20 million people to their municipalities...\\n\\n\\\"But experts warned that it would not be enough to stop the spread of the pneumonia-like virus, which has now killed 17 people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. The number of people infected in China stood at 617 on Thursday afternoon.\\\"\\n\\nMarkets shudder. WSJ's Steven Russolillo and Avantika Chilkoti: \\\"Investors fear that if the sickness grows into a pandemic like the SARS outbreak in 2002, it could slow global economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 152.06 points, or 0.5%, to 29196.04, its first decline in six sessions. The S&P 500 fell 8.83 points, or 0.3%, to 3320.79. The Nasdaq Composite lost 18.14 points, or 0.2%, to 9370.81.\\\"\\n\\nThere's more turbulence ahead, also via the WSJ: \\\"Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down 0.1%, while the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 slipped 0.2%. The Shanghai Composite Index sank 2.8%, its biggest drop since May, on the final day of trading before the market closes for the Lunar New Year holiday period.\\\"\\n\\n\\u2014 Home sales are looking up. WSJ's Will Parker and Sarah Chaney: \\\"Home sales hit their high mark for the year in December, a sign that favorable mortgage rates and low unemployment are starting to lure more house hunters back into the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 3.6% in December compared with November to reach a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.\\n\\n\\\"Compared with a year earlier, December sales of existing homes were up 10.8%, though December 2018 was a particularly weak month for sales and economic uncertainty around the federal government shutdown caused some buyers to delay purchases, NAR found.\\\"\\n\\n\\u2014 Mnuchin tells Greta Thunberg to study economics. CNBC's Sam Meredith: \\\"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sharply criticized the financial credentials of Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg on Thursday, saying the 17-year-old should study economics at college before lecturing the U.S. on fossil fuel investments. Speaking at a press briefing at the [World Economic Forum], Mnuchin was asked whether the world\\u2019s largest economy needed to completely and immediately divest from fossil fuels.\\n\\n\\u201c'Is she the chief economist or who is she? I\\u2019m confused,' Mnuchin said, before adding this was 'a joke. That was funny.' 'After she goes and studies economics in college she can come back and explain that to us,' Mnuchin said. Thunberg, alongside 20 other young climate activists, has called on all of those attending the forum to stop the 'madness' of ongoing investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction and 'completely divest' from fossil fuels.\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Elizabeth Warren is pressing banks on their climate change plans. Reuters reports the Massachusetts Democrat \\\"is asking the biggest U.S. banks for details on their assessments of and preparations for risks related to global warming. 'To protect themselves and the economy from climate-driven catastrophes, large financial institutions must act quickly to address risks,' Warren, a frequent critic of big banks, said in letters sent on Tuesday to top executives at Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, State Street and Wells Fargo.\\\"\\n\\nShe asked \\\"for more information about the risks caused by the climate crisis on the financial industry and your institution\\u2019s practices, including what steps, if any, your institution is taking to adapt to mitigate these risks,\\\" and requested detailed responses by Feb. 7.\\n\\n\\u2014 Europe is bracing for Trump\\u2019s attacks: \\u201cEuropean politicians said they are prepared to defend themselves and would retaliate against any American tariffs, after [Trump] set his sights on the continent as the next front in his global fight over trade,\\u201d the Wall Street Journal\\u2019s Stephen Fidler and Greg Ip report.\\n\\n\\u201cWith a first-phase China deal in his pocket, [Trump] said he wants to reach an agreement with the European Union before the U.S. presidential election, and threatened to levy tariffs if talks failed. \\u2026 France\\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, who was also making the rounds at Davos, quickly shot back. \\u2018If we were to be hit by American tariffs, we would have no choice but to retaliate,\\u2019 he told The Wall Street Journal.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 More from Le Maire: He said \\u201cthe EU had already shown itself prepared to retaliate when the U.S. imposed tariffs on European steel. \\u2018A trade war between U.S. and Europe would be a full political and economic failure,\\u2019 he said.\\u201d\\n\\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross weighs in, via The Post's Heather Long:\\n\\n\\u2014 Canadian prosecutors say fraud is key to Huawei case: \\u201cHuawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou returned to a Vancouver courtroom ... where Canadian prosecutors defended a U.S. extradition request, saying Meng\\u2019s alleged bank fraud is the heart of the case that has strained relations between Ottawa and Beijing,\\u201d Tessa Vikander of Reuters reports.\\n\\n\\u201cCanadian prosecutors have told the British Columbia Supreme Court that Meng was arrested on charges of bank fraud, which is a crime in both countries, and not because of U.S. allegations she violated U.S. sanctions against Iran.\\u201d\\n\\nIMPEACHMENT MINUTE: A speed read on the latest from the congressional impeachment process.\\n\\n\\\"Democrats scale back language as Trump and GOP press ahead with attacks on Senate impeachment trial.\\\" By The Post's Seung Min Kim, Elise Viebeck and Colby Itkowitz\\n\\n\\\"Biden says he refuses to be part of impeachment witness deal.\\\" By The Post's Matt Viser\\n\\n\\\"Gordon Sondland plugs away in Brussels while playing a central role in Trump\\u2019s impeachment trial.\\\" By The Post's Michael Birnbaum, John Hudson, Josh Dawsey and Aaron C. Davis\\n\\n\\u2014 U.N. says MBS was involved in Bezos hack: \\u201cUnited Nations human rights investigators have now concluded with \\u2018medium to high confidence\\u2019 that an account belonging to [Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman sent [an] infected video to [Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff] Bezos, triggering a gigantic extraction of data and fueling a concerted campaign against the billionaire, Amazon and The Post,\\u201d my colleague Marc Fisher reports.\\n\\n\\u201cHuman rights investigators Agnes Callamard and David Kaye said that a forensic probe of Bezos\\u2019s phone \\u2018suggests the possible involvement of the Crown Prince in surveillance of Mr. Bezos, in an effort to influence, if not silence, The Washington Post\\u2019s reporting on Saudi Arabia.\\u2019 In a statement, Callamard and Kaye called for the United States and other nations to investigate the alleged hacking of Bezos\\u2019s phone as part of a larger look at what they called \\u2018the continuous, multiyear, direct and personal involvement of the Crown Prince in efforts to target perceived opponents.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\u2022 How it happened: Bezos and Mohammed had dinner in April 2018 and exchanged texts afterward. \\u201cFour weeks later, on May 1, the prince sent Bezos a WhatsApp message containing a video in Arabic promoting Saudi Arabia\\u2019s telecom market,\\u201d our colleague writes. \\u201cAllegedly inside the video file, according to a United Nations report, was a tiny, malicious piece of code that allowed the sender to extract massive amounts of information from the phone over the course of many months.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The connection to Jamal Khashoggi: \\u201cThe United Nations experts decided to examine the hacking of Bezos\\u2019s phone as an extension of their investigation into the killing of Khashoggi, who wrote opinion columns for The Post and was killed in October 2018 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The Kingdom dismissed the report: \\u201cSaudi Arabia\\u2019s foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, called the U.N. report \\u2018absurd.\\u2019 At a meeting of world leaders in Davos, Switzerland, the minister said, \\u2018The idea that the crown prince would hack Jeff Bezos\\u2019s phone is absolutely silly.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\n\\u2014 New Boeing CEO says company has hurt itself: Boeing chief executive David Calhoun, speaking on a conference call with reporters for his first public comments as CEO, \\u201csaid Boeing has been \\u2018our own worst enemy\\u2019 in the months since the Federal Aviation Administration has worked to certify safety improvements to the plane. The company publicly set deadlines it didn\\u2019t keep and pressured the FAA to speed up its certification, damaging its relationships with regulators, customers and the flying public,\\u201d my colleague Douglas MacMillan reports.\\n\\n\\u201cThe CEO went further than his predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, in saying the company and regulators made a \\u2018fatal assumption\\u2019 in how pilots would respond to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) in situations when it forcefully pushed the jets\\u2019 noses downward. He described the circumstances that led to these crashes as a \\u2018boundary condition,\\u2019 which wasn\\u2019t considered in the design of the jets. \\u2026 Another priority for Calhoun will be repairing Boeing\\u2019s corporate culture following recent revelations that employees had mocked regulators, bragged about persuading an airline not to require training and described its airplane as \\u2018designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The debacle has cost the company more than $25 billion: \\u201c Boeing Co. bill for the 737 MAX grounding could balloon to more than $25 billion, analysts estimated on Wednesday, a day after the U.S. plane maker warned of further delay in returning its once best-selling jet to service, \\u201d \\u2019 Ankit Ajmera reports.\\n\\n\\u2014 Complaint says FAA had lower bar for Southwest: \\u201cU.S. air-safety regulators likely acted improperly in the way they authorized Southwest Airlines Co. to begin flights between California and Hawaii last year, according to the main government agency that handles federal whistleblower complaints,\\u201d WSJ\\u2019s Andy Pasztor and Alison Sider report.\\n\\n\\u201cThe preliminary conclusion by the Office of Special Counsel pertains to a Federal Aviation Administration employee\\u2019s allegations that agency managers gave the carrier preferential treatment by rushing the approval process and cutting corners in other ways. The counsel\\u2019s staff \\u2018found a substantial likelihood of wrongdoing\\u2019 by FAA employees, according to one document, among several documents and emails between staff and the whistleblower reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The inquiry hasn\\u2019t been made public.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u2014 TikTok looks for new CEO: \\u201cChinese Internet giant ByteDance Inc. is seeking a new chief executive officer for its TikTok business, a hugely popular video app that American politicians have targeted as a potential security threat,\\u201d Bloomberg\\u2019s Kurt Wagner and Sarah Fryer report.\\n\\n\\u201cThe company has interviewed candidates in recent months for the CEO role, which would be based in the U.S., according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the search is private.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u2014 Tech giants are spending big money on lobbying: \\u201cTen years ago, Google executives rarely spoke to Congress.

The forum\\u2019s own social mobility index ranks the United States 27th in the world, behind Estonia, Lithuania, and Singapore. The bottom half of Americans own just 1.6 percent of the nation\\u2019s wealth, up from 1.1 percent when President Trump took office but down from 2.1 percent in 2006 \\u2014 and that group is largely untouched by stock market gains. And while wages have started rising faster for lower-income earners, they have a wide chasm to close with those at the top:\\n\\nThe divergent prospects for the narrowest slice of winners in the U.S. economy and the rest of the population were on stark display in Davos this week. And they point to a challenge for President Trump as he swaps out his 2016 campaign promise to restore the fortunes of what he called \\\"the forgotten man\\\" for a message that claims victory and defends the status quo.\\n\\nAddressing the global elite at the Swiss conclave, Trump called the U.S. economy the \\u201cgreatest economy we\\u2019ve ever had in the history of our country,\\u201d one that is \\u201cno longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few.\\u201d\\n\\nThe data support neither claim. (Growth topped 4 percent for four straight years during the 1990s, for example, while under Trump, the economy has yet to record a full year of growth above 3 percent.) More significantly, though, Trump's position ignores the structural problems exacerbating the spread between the haves and have-nots, which are primed to throttle future growth. \\u201cInequality generally has deteriorated everywhere, but it is still the case that the U.S. is by far the most unequal country in the world in terms of income distribution and wealth distribution,\\u201d Deutsche Bank Securities chief economist Torsten Slok said in a podcast interview from Davos.\\n\\nWealth has indeed piled up in the United States since the financial crisis as stock and home prices have risen. But as Slok explains, contrary to Trump\\u2019s claim, it \\u201chas been concentrated in fewer hands.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s correct that stock prices have gone up and home prices have gone up,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat has benefited those who own stocks and those who own homes. But unfortunately it\\u2019s fewer and fewer people who own stocks and fewer and fewer people who own homes. So that means inequality has actually been increasing even though we have seen this increase in stock prices and home prices.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd because wealthier people have less of a tendency to spend extra money they pull in, as they get richer, the consumption that supports most economic activity remains stagnant. \\u201cIt means that growth is probably going to be on the weaker side,\\\" Slok says.\\n\\nThat risk is front and center for economists, according to Saadia Zahidi, the WEF\\u2019s managing director. \\u201cWe did a chief economist outlook a couple weeks ago, and one of the biggest threats to global growth over the coming year is likely to be the economically-motivated social protest that we\\u2019re seeing,\\u201d she told Bloomberg TV. And Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell has called inequality the greatest threat to the U.S. economy over the next decade.\\n\\nBut financiers aren\\u2019t registering the same alarm. They are advising investors to boost their exposure to the market. \\u201cCash is trash,\\u201d Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world, told CNBC. \\u201cGet out of cash.\\u201d Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones agreed: \\u201cThe train has got a long, long way to go if you think about it,\\u201d he told the network.\\n\\nAnd JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, while declining to discuss 2020 candidates by name, issued a warning about the dangers of socialism that appeared aimed at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has been rising in the Democratic primary polls for president. Socialist governments, he said, produce \\\"an eroding society... They do need to fix inner-city schools, infrastructure, health care. We can fix all of those in a capitalist society.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd Andrew Ross Sorkin, who helped conduct the CNBC interview with Dimon, weighed in to fact-check Sanders:\\n\\n\\u2014 Wuhan quarantine expands as coronavirus spreads. The Post's Anna Fifield: \\\"The central Chinese city of Wuhan pulsated with fear and anger Thursday, as 11 million people awoke to news that they were being confined to a metropolis-sized quarantine zone designed to contain a widening coronavirus outbreak.

The company publicly set deadlines it didn\\u2019t keep and pressured the FAA to speed up its certification, damaging its relationships with regulators, customers and the flying public,\\u201d my colleague Douglas MacMillan reports.\\n\\n\\u201cThe CEO went further than his predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, in saying the company and regulators made a \\u2018fatal assumption\\u2019 in how pilots would respond to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) in situations when it forcefully pushed the jets\\u2019 noses downward. He described the circumstances that led to these crashes as a \\u2018boundary condition,\\u2019 which wasn\\u2019t considered in the design of the jets. \\u2026 Another priority for Calhoun will be repairing Boeing\\u2019s corporate culture following recent revelations that employees had mocked regulators, bragged about persuading an airline not to require training and described its airplane as \\u2018designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The debacle has cost the company more than $25 billion: \\u201c Boeing Co. bill for the 737 MAX grounding could balloon to more than $25 billion, analysts estimated on Wednesday, a day after the U.S. plane maker warned of further delay in returning its once best-selling jet to service, \\u201d \\u2019 Ankit Ajmera reports.\\n\\n\\u2014 Complaint says FAA had lower bar for Southwest: \\u201cU.S. air-safety regulators likely acted improperly in the way they authorized Southwest Airlines Co. to begin flights between California and Hawaii last year, according to the main government agency that handles federal whistleblower complaints,\\u201d WSJ\\u2019s Andy Pasztor and Alison Sider report.\\n\\n\\u201cThe preliminary conclusion by the Office of Special Counsel pertains to a Federal Aviation Administration employee\\u2019s allegations that agency managers gave the carrier preferential treatment by rushing the approval process and cutting corners in other ways.

The forum\\u2019s own social mobility index ranks the United States 27th in the world, behind Estonia, Lithuania, and Singapore. The bottom half of Americans own just 1.6 percent of the nation\\u2019s wealth, up from 1.1 percent when President Trump took office but down from 2.1 percent in 2006 \\u2014 and that group is largely untouched by stock market gains. And while wages have started rising faster for lower-income earners, they have a wide chasm to close with those at the top:\\n\\nThe divergent prospects for the narrowest slice of winners in the U.S. economy and the rest of the population were on stark display in Davos this week. And they point to a challenge for President Trump as he swaps out his 2016 campaign promise to restore the fortunes of what he called \\\"the forgotten man\\\" for a message that claims victory and defends the status quo.\\n\\nAddressing the global elite at the Swiss conclave, Trump called the U.S. economy the \\u201cgreatest economy we\\u2019ve ever had in the history of our country,\\u201d one that is \\u201cno longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few.\\u201d\\n\\nThe data support neither claim. (Growth topped 4 percent for four straight years during the 1990s, for example, while under Trump, the economy has yet to record a full year of growth above 3 percent.) More significantly, though, Trump's position ignores the structural problems exacerbating the spread between the haves and have-nots, which are primed to throttle future growth. \\u201cInequality generally has deteriorated everywhere, but it is still the case that the U.S. is by far the most unequal country in the world in terms of income distribution and wealth distribution,\\u201d Deutsche Bank Securities chief economist Torsten Slok said in a podcast interview from Davos.\\n\\nWealth has indeed piled up in the United States since the financial crisis as stock and home prices have risen. But as Slok explains, contrary to Trump\\u2019s claim, it \\u201chas been concentrated in fewer hands.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s correct that stock prices have gone up and home prices have gone up,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat has benefited those who own stocks and those who own homes. But unfortunately it\\u2019s fewer and fewer people who own stocks and fewer and fewer people who own homes. So that means inequality has actually been increasing even though we have seen this increase in stock prices and home prices.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd because wealthier people have less of a tendency to spend extra money they pull in, as they get richer, the consumption that supports most economic activity remains stagnant. \\u201cIt means that growth is probably going to be on the weaker side,\\\" Slok says.\\n\\nThat risk is front and center for economists, according to Saadia Zahidi, the WEF\\u2019s managing director. \\u201cWe did a chief economist outlook a couple weeks ago, and one of the biggest threats to global growth over the coming year is likely to be the economically-motivated social protest that we\\u2019re seeing,\\u201d she told Bloomberg TV. And Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell has called inequality the greatest threat to the U.S. economy over the next decade.\\n\\nBut financiers aren\\u2019t registering the same alarm. They are advising investors to boost their exposure to the market. \\u201cCash is trash,\\u201d Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world, told CNBC. \\u201cGet out of cash.\\u201d Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones agreed: \\u201cThe train has got a long, long way to go if you think about it,\\u201d he told the network.\\n\\nAnd JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, while declining to discuss 2020 candidates by name, issued a warning about the dangers of socialism that appeared aimed at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has been rising in the Democratic primary polls for president. Socialist governments, he said, produce \\\"an eroding society... They do need to fix inner-city schools, infrastructure, health care. We can fix all of those in a capitalist society.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd Andrew Ross Sorkin, who helped conduct the CNBC interview with Dimon, weighed in to fact-check Sanders:\\n\\n\\u2014 Wuhan quarantine expands as coronavirus spreads. The Post's Anna Fifield: \\\"The central Chinese city of Wuhan pulsated with fear and anger Thursday, as 11 million people awoke to news that they were being confined to a metropolis-sized quarantine zone designed to contain a widening coronavirus outbreak. The quarantine is also spreading, with nearby Huanggang and Ezhou announcing they were shutting down travel networks, effectively confining some 20 million people to their municipalities...\\n\\n\\\"But experts warned that it would not be enough to stop the spread of the pneumonia-like virus, which has now killed 17 people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. The number of people infected in China stood at 617 on Thursday afternoon.\\\"\\n\\nMarkets shudder. WSJ's Steven Russolillo and Avantika Chilkoti: \\\"Investors fear that if the sickness grows into a pandemic like the SARS outbreak in 2002, it could slow global economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 152.06 points, or 0.5%, to 29196.04, its first decline in six sessions. The S&P 500 fell 8.83 points, or 0.3%, to 3320.79.

WSJ's Will Parker and Sarah Chaney: \\\"Home sales hit their high mark for the year in December, a sign that favorable mortgage rates and low unemployment are starting to lure more house hunters back into the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 3.6% in December compared with November to reach a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.\\n\\n\\\"Compared with a year earlier, December sales of existing homes were up 10.8%, though December 2018 was a particularly weak month for sales and economic uncertainty around the federal government shutdown caused some buyers to delay purchases, NAR found.\\\"\\n\\n\\u2014 Mnuchin tells Greta Thunberg to study economics. CNBC's Sam Meredith: \\\"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sharply criticized the financial credentials of Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg on Thursday, saying the 17-year-old should study economics at college before lecturing the U.S. on fossil fuel investments. Speaking at a press briefing at the [World Economic Forum], Mnuchin was asked whether the world\\u2019s largest economy needed to completely and immediately divest from fossil fuels.\\n\\n\\u201c'Is she the chief economist or who is she?

The forum\\u2019s own social mobility index ranks the United States 27th in the world, behind Estonia, Lithuania, and Singapore. The bottom half of Americans own just 1.6 percent of the nation\\u2019s wealth, up from 1.1 percent when President Trump took office but down from 2.1 percent in 2006 \\u2014 and that group is largely untouched by stock market gains. And while wages have started rising faster for lower-income earners, they have a wide chasm to close with those at the top:\\n\\nThe divergent prospects for the narrowest slice of winners in the U.S. economy and the rest of the population were on stark display in Davos this week. And they point to a challenge for President Trump as he swaps out his 2016 campaign promise to restore the fortunes of what he called \\\"the forgotten man\\\" for a message that claims victory and defends the status quo.\\n\\nAddressing the global elite at the Swiss conclave, Trump called the U.S. economy the \\u201cgreatest economy we\\u2019ve ever had in the history of our country,\\u201d one that is \\u201cno longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few.\\u201d\\n\\nThe data support neither claim. (Growth topped 4 percent for four straight years during the 1990s, for example, while under Trump, the economy has yet to record a full year of growth above 3 percent.) More significantly, though, Trump's position ignores the structural problems exacerbating the spread between the haves and have-nots, which are primed to throttle future growth. \\u201cInequality generally has deteriorated everywhere, but it is still the case that the U.S. is by far the most unequal country in the world in terms of income distribution and wealth distribution,\\u201d Deutsche Bank Securities chief economist Torsten Slok said in a podcast interview from Davos.\\n\\nWealth has indeed piled up in the United States since the financial crisis as stock and home prices have risen. But as Slok explains, contrary to Trump\\u2019s claim, it \\u201chas been concentrated in fewer hands.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s correct that stock prices have gone up and home prices have gone up,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat has benefited those who own stocks and those who own homes. But unfortunately it\\u2019s fewer and fewer people who own stocks and fewer and fewer people who own homes. So that means inequality has actually been increasing even though we have seen this increase in stock prices and home prices.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd because wealthier people have less of a tendency to spend extra money they pull in, as they get richer, the consumption that supports most economic activity remains stagnant. \\u201cIt means that growth is probably going to be on the weaker side,\\\" Slok says.\\n\\nThat risk is front and center for economists, according to Saadia Zahidi, the WEF\\u2019s managing director. \\u201cWe did a chief economist outlook a couple weeks ago, and one of the biggest threats to global growth over the coming year is likely to be the economically-motivated social protest that we\\u2019re seeing,\\u201d she told Bloomberg TV. And Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell has called inequality the greatest threat to the U.S. economy over the next decade.\\n\\nBut financiers aren\\u2019t registering the same alarm. They are advising investors to boost their exposure to the market. \\u201cCash is trash,\\u201d Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world, told CNBC. \\u201cGet out of cash.\\u201d Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones agreed: \\u201cThe train has got a long, long way to go if you think about it,\\u201d he told the network.\\n\\nAnd JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, while declining to discuss 2020 candidates by name, issued a warning about the dangers of socialism that appeared aimed at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has been rising in the Democratic primary polls for president. Socialist governments, he said, produce \\\"an eroding society... They do need to fix inner-city schools, infrastructure, health care. We can fix all of those in a capitalist society.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd Andrew Ross Sorkin, who helped conduct the CNBC interview with Dimon, weighed in to fact-check Sanders:\\n\\n\\u2014 Wuhan quarantine expands as coronavirus spreads. The Post's Anna Fifield: \\\"The central Chinese city of Wuhan pulsated with fear and anger Thursday, as 11 million people awoke to news that they were being confined to a metropolis-sized quarantine zone designed to contain a widening coronavirus outbreak. The quarantine is also spreading, with nearby Huanggang and Ezhou announcing they were shutting down travel networks, effectively confining some 20 million people to their municipalities...\\n\\n\\\"But experts warned that it would not be enough to stop the spread of the pneumonia-like virus, which has now killed 17 people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province.

The forum\\u2019s own social mobility index ranks the United States 27th in the world, behind Estonia, Lithuania, and Singapore. The bottom half of Americans own just 1.6 percent of the nation\\u2019s wealth, up from 1.1 percent when President Trump took office but down from 2.1 percent in 2006 \\u2014 and that group is largely untouched by stock market gains. And while wages have started rising faster for lower-income earners, they have a wide chasm to close with those at the top:\\n\\nThe divergent prospects for the narrowest slice of winners in the U.S. economy and the rest of the population were on stark display in Davos this week. And they point to a challenge for President Trump as he swaps out his 2016 campaign promise to restore the fortunes of what he called \\\"the forgotten man\\\" for a message that claims victory and defends the status quo.\\n\\nAddressing the global elite at the Swiss conclave, Trump called the U.S. economy the \\u201cgreatest economy we\\u2019ve ever had in the history of our country,\\u201d one that is \\u201cno longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few.\\u201d\\n\\nThe data support neither claim. (Growth topped 4 percent for four straight years during the 1990s, for example, while under Trump, the economy has yet to record a full year of growth above 3 percent.) More significantly, though, Trump's position ignores the structural problems exacerbating the spread between the haves and have-nots, which are primed to throttle future growth. \\u201cInequality generally has deteriorated everywhere, but it is still the case that the U.S. is by far the most unequal country in the world in terms of income distribution and wealth distribution,\\u201d Deutsche Bank Securities chief economist Torsten Slok said in a podcast interview from Davos.\\n\\nWealth has indeed piled up in the United States since the financial crisis as stock and home prices have risen. But as Slok explains, contrary to Trump\\u2019s claim, it \\u201chas been concentrated in fewer hands.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s correct that stock prices have gone up and home prices have gone up,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat has benefited those who own stocks and those who own homes. But unfortunately it\\u2019s fewer and fewer people who own stocks and fewer and fewer people who own homes. So that means inequality has actually been increasing even though we have seen this increase in stock prices and home prices.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd because wealthier people have less of a tendency to spend extra money they pull in, as they get richer, the consumption that supports most economic activity remains stagnant. \\u201cIt means that growth is probably going to be on the weaker side,\\\" Slok says.\\n\\nThat risk is front and center for economists, according to Saadia Zahidi, the WEF\\u2019s managing director. \\u201cWe did a chief economist outlook a couple weeks ago, and one of the biggest threats to global growth over the coming year is likely to be the economically-motivated social protest that we\\u2019re seeing,\\u201d she told Bloomberg TV. And Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell has called inequality the greatest threat to the U.S. economy over the next decade.\\n\\nBut financiers aren\\u2019t registering the same alarm. They are advising investors to boost their exposure to the market. \\u201cCash is trash,\\u201d Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world, told CNBC. \\u201cGet out of cash.\\u201d Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones agreed: \\u201cThe train has got a long, long way to go if you think about it,\\u201d he told the network.\\n\\nAnd JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, while declining to discuss 2020 candidates by name, issued a warning about the dangers of socialism that appeared aimed at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has been rising in the Democratic primary polls for president. Socialist governments, he said, produce \\\"an eroding society... They do need to fix inner-city schools, infrastructure, health care. We can fix all of those in a capitalist society.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd Andrew Ross Sorkin, who helped conduct the CNBC interview with Dimon, weighed in to fact-check Sanders:\\n\\n\\u2014 Wuhan quarantine expands as coronavirus spreads. The Post's Anna Fifield: \\\"The central Chinese city of Wuhan pulsated with fear and anger Thursday, as 11 million people awoke to news that they were being confined to a metropolis-sized quarantine zone designed to contain a widening coronavirus outbreak. The quarantine is also spreading, with nearby Huanggang and Ezhou announcing they were shutting down travel networks, effectively confining some 20 million people to their municipalities...\\n\\n\\\"But experts warned that it would not be enough to stop the spread of the pneumonia-like virus, which has now killed 17 people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. The number of people infected in China stood at 617 on Thursday afternoon.\\\"\\n\\nMarkets shudder. WSJ's Steven Russolillo and Avantika Chilkoti: \\\"Investors fear that if the sickness grows into a pandemic like the SARS outbreak in 2002, it could slow global economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 152.06 points, or 0.5%, to 29196.04, its first decline in six sessions. The S&P 500 fell 8.83 points, or 0.3%, to 3320.79.

WSJ's Will Parker and Sarah Chaney: \\\"Home sales hit their high mark for the year in December, a sign that favorable mortgage rates and low unemployment are starting to lure more house hunters back into the market.

CNBC's Sam Meredith: \\\"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sharply criticized the financial credentials of Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg on Thursday, saying the 17-year-old should study economics at college before lecturing the U.S. on fossil fuel investments.

The forum\\u2019s own social mobility index ranks the United States 27th in the world, behind Estonia, Lithuania, and Singapore. The bottom half of Americans own just 1.6 percent of the nation\\u2019s wealth, up from 1.1 percent when President Trump took office but down from 2.1 percent in 2006 \\u2014 and that group is largely untouched by stock market gains. And while wages have started rising faster for lower-income earners, they have a wide chasm to close with those at the top:\\n\\nThe divergent prospects for the narrowest slice of winners in the U.S. economy and the rest of the population were on stark display in Davos this week. And they point to a challenge for President Trump as he swaps out his 2016 campaign promise to restore the fortunes of what he called \\\"the forgotten man\\\" for a message that claims victory and defends the status quo.\\n\\nAddressing the global elite at the Swiss conclave, Trump called the U.S. economy the \\u201cgreatest economy we\\u2019ve ever had in the history of our country,\\u201d one that is \\u201cno longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few.\\u201d\\n\\nThe data support neither claim. (Growth topped 4 percent for four straight years during the 1990s, for example, while under Trump, the economy has yet to record a full year of growth above 3 percent.) More significantly, though, Trump's position ignores the structural problems exacerbating the spread between the haves and have-nots, which are primed to throttle future growth. \\u201cInequality generally has deteriorated everywhere, but it is still the case that the U.S. is by far the most unequal country in the world in terms of income distribution and wealth distribution,\\u201d Deutsche Bank Securities chief economist Torsten Slok said in a podcast interview from Davos.\\n\\nWealth has indeed piled up in the United States since the financial crisis as stock and home prices have risen. But as Slok explains, contrary to Trump\\u2019s claim, it \\u201chas been concentrated in fewer hands.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s correct that stock prices have gone up and home prices have gone up,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat has benefited those who own stocks and those who own homes. But unfortunately it\\u2019s fewer and fewer people who own stocks and fewer and fewer people who own homes. So that means inequality has actually been increasing even though we have seen this increase in stock prices and home prices.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd because wealthier people have less of a tendency to spend extra money they pull in, as they get richer, the consumption that supports most economic activity remains stagnant. \\u201cIt means that growth is probably going to be on the weaker side,\\\" Slok says.\\n\\nThat risk is front and center for economists, according to Saadia Zahidi, the WEF\\u2019s managing director. \\u201cWe did a chief economist outlook a couple weeks ago, and one of the biggest threats to global growth over the coming year is likely to be the economically-motivated social protest that we\\u2019re seeing,\\u201d she told Bloomberg TV. And Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell has called inequality the greatest threat to the U.S. economy over the next decade.\\n\\nBut financiers aren\\u2019t registering the same alarm. They are advising investors to boost their exposure to the market. \\u201cCash is trash,\\u201d Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world, told CNBC. \\u201cGet out of cash.\\u201d Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones agreed: \\u201cThe train has got a long, long way to go if you think about it,\\u201d he told the network.\\n\\nAnd JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, while declining to discuss 2020 candidates by name, issued a warning about the dangers of socialism that appeared aimed at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has been rising in the Democratic primary polls for president. Socialist governments, he said, produce \\\"an eroding society... They do need to fix inner-city schools, infrastructure, health care. We can fix all of those in a capitalist society.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd Andrew Ross Sorkin, who helped conduct the CNBC interview with Dimon, weighed in to fact-check Sanders:\\n\\n\\u2014 Wuhan quarantine expands as coronavirus spreads. The Post's Anna Fifield: \\\"The central Chinese city of Wuhan pulsated with fear and anger Thursday, as 11 million people awoke to news that they were being confined to a metropolis-sized quarantine zone designed to contain a widening coronavirus outbreak. The quarantine is also spreading, with nearby Huanggang and Ezhou announcing they were shutting down travel networks, effectively confining some 20 million people to their municipalities...\\n\\n\\\"But experts warned that it would not be enough to stop the spread of the pneumonia-like virus, which has now killed 17 people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. The number of people infected in China stood at 617 on Thursday afternoon.\\\"\\n\\nMarkets shudder. WSJ's Steven Russolillo and Avantika Chilkoti: \\\"Investors fear that if the sickness grows into a pandemic like the SARS outbreak in 2002, it could slow global economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 152.06 points, or 0.5%, to 29196.04, its first decline in six sessions. The S&P 500 fell 8.83 points, or 0.3%, to 3320.79. The Nasdaq Composite lost 18.14 points, or 0.2%, to 9370.81.\\\"\\n\\nThere's more turbulence ahead, also via the WSJ: \\\"Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down 0.1%, while the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 slipped 0.2%. The Shanghai Composite Index sank 2.8%, its biggest drop since May, on the final day of trading before the market closes for the Lunar New Year holiday period.\\\"\\n\\n\\u2014 Home sales are looking up. WSJ's Will Parker and Sarah Chaney: \\\"Home sales hit their high mark for the year in December, a sign that favorable mortgage rates and low unemployment are starting to lure more house hunters back into the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 3.6% in December compared with November to reach a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.\\n\\n\\\"Compared with a year earlier, December sales of existing homes were up 10.8%, though December 2018 was a particularly weak month for sales and economic uncertainty around the federal government shutdown caused some buyers to delay purchases, NAR found.\\\"\\n\\n\\u2014 Mnuchin tells Greta Thunberg to study economics. CNBC's Sam Meredith: \\\"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sharply criticized the financial credentials of Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg on Thursday, saying the 17-year-old should study economics at college before lecturing the U.S. on fossil fuel investments. Speaking at a press briefing at the [World Economic Forum], Mnuchin was asked whether the world\\u2019s largest economy needed to completely and immediately divest from fossil fuels.\\n\\n\\u201c'Is she the chief economist or who is she? I\\u2019m confused,' Mnuchin said, before adding this was 'a joke. That was funny.' 'After she goes and studies economics in college she can come back and explain that to us,' Mnuchin said. Thunberg, alongside 20 other young climate activists, has called on all of those attending the forum to stop the 'madness' of ongoing investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction and 'completely divest' from fossil fuels.\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Elizabeth Warren is pressing banks on their climate change plans. Reuters reports the Massachusetts Democrat \\\"is asking the biggest U.S. banks for details on their assessments of and preparations for risks related to global warming. 'To protect themselves and the economy from climate-driven catastrophes, large financial institutions must act quickly to address risks,' Warren, a frequent critic of big banks, said in letters sent on Tuesday to top executives at Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, State Street and Wells Fargo.\\\"\\n\\nShe asked \\\"for more information about the risks caused by the climate crisis on the financial industry and your institution\\u2019s practices, including what steps, if any, your institution is taking to adapt to mitigate these risks,\\\" and requested detailed responses by Feb. 7.\\n\\n\\u2014 Europe is bracing for Trump\\u2019s attacks: \\u201cEuropean politicians said they are prepared to defend themselves and would retaliate against any American tariffs, after [Trump] set his sights on the continent as the next front in his global fight over trade,\\u201d the Wall Street Journal\\u2019s Stephen Fidler and Greg Ip report.\\n\\n\\u201cWith a first-phase China deal in his pocket, [Trump] said he wants to reach an agreement with the European Union before the U.S. presidential election, and threatened to levy tariffs if talks failed. \\u2026 France\\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, who was also making the rounds at Davos, quickly shot back. \\u2018If we were to be hit by American tariffs, we would have no choice but to retaliate,\\u2019 he told The Wall Street Journal.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 More from Le Maire: He said \\u201cthe EU had already shown itself prepared to retaliate when the U.S. imposed tariffs on European steel. \\u2018A trade war between U.S. and Europe would be a full political and economic failure,\\u2019 he said.\\u201d\\n\\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross weighs in, via The Post's Heather Long:\\n\\n\\u2014 Canadian prosecutors say fraud is key to Huawei case: \\u201cHuawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou returned to a Vancouver courtroom ... where Canadian prosecutors defended a U.S. extradition request, saying Meng\\u2019s alleged bank fraud is the heart of the case that has strained relations between Ottawa and Beijing,\\u201d Tessa Vikander of Reuters reports.\\n\\n\\u201cCanadian prosecutors have told the British Columbia Supreme Court that Meng was arrested on charges of bank fraud, which is a crime in both countries, and not because of U.S. allegations she violated U.S. sanctions against Iran.\\u201d\\n\\nIMPEACHMENT MINUTE: A speed read on the latest from the congressional impeachment process.\\n\\n\\\"Democrats scale back language as Trump and GOP press ahead with attacks on Senate impeachment trial.\\\" By The Post's Seung Min Kim, Elise Viebeck and Colby Itkowitz\\n\\n\\\"Biden says he refuses to be part of impeachment witness deal.\\\" By The Post's Matt Viser\\n\\n\\\"Gordon Sondland plugs away in Brussels while playing a central role in Trump\\u2019s impeachment trial.\\\" By The Post's Michael Birnbaum, John Hudson, Josh Dawsey and Aaron C. Davis\\n\\n\\u2014 U.N. says MBS was involved in Bezos hack: \\u201cUnited Nations human rights investigators have now concluded with \\u2018medium to high confidence\\u2019 that an account belonging to [Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman sent [an] infected video to [Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff] Bezos, triggering a gigantic extraction of data and fueling a concerted campaign against the billionaire, Amazon and The Post,\\u201d my colleague Marc Fisher reports.\\n\\n\\u201cHuman rights investigators Agnes Callamard and David Kaye said that a forensic probe of Bezos\\u2019s phone \\u2018suggests the possible involvement of the Crown Prince in surveillance of Mr. Bezos, in an effort to influence, if not silence, The Washington Post\\u2019s reporting on Saudi Arabia.\\u2019 In a statement, Callamard and Kaye called for the United States and other nations to investigate the alleged hacking of Bezos\\u2019s phone as part of a larger look at what they called \\u2018the continuous, multiyear, direct and personal involvement of the Crown Prince in efforts to target perceived opponents.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\u2022 How it happened: Bezos and Mohammed had dinner in April 2018 and exchanged texts afterward. \\u201cFour weeks later, on May 1, the prince sent Bezos a WhatsApp message containing a video in Arabic promoting Saudi Arabia\\u2019s telecom market,\\u201d our colleague writes. \\u201cAllegedly inside the video file, according to a United Nations report, was a tiny, malicious piece of code that allowed the sender to extract massive amounts of information from the phone over the course of many months.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The connection to Jamal Khashoggi: \\u201cThe United Nations experts decided to examine the hacking of Bezos\\u2019s phone as an extension of their investigation into the killing of Khashoggi, who wrote opinion columns for The Post and was killed in October 2018 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The Kingdom dismissed the report: \\u201cSaudi Arabia\\u2019s foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, called the U.N. report \\u2018absurd.\\u2019 At a meeting of world leaders in Davos, Switzerland, the minister said, \\u2018The idea that the crown prince would hack Jeff Bezos\\u2019s phone is absolutely silly.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\n\\u2014 New Boeing CEO says company has hurt itself: Boeing chief executive David Calhoun, speaking on a conference call with reporters for his first public comments as CEO, \\u201csaid Boeing has been \\u2018our own worst enemy\\u2019 in the months since the Federal Aviation Administration has worked to certify safety improvements to the plane. The company publicly set deadlines it didn\\u2019t keep and pressured the FAA to speed up its certification, damaging its relationships with regulators, customers and the flying public,\\u201d my colleague Douglas MacMillan reports.\\n\\n\\u201cThe CEO went further than his predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, in saying the company and regulators made a \\u2018fatal assumption\\u2019 in how pilots would respond to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) in situations when it forcefully pushed the jets\\u2019 noses downward. He described the circumstances that led to these crashes as a \\u2018boundary condition,\\u2019 which wasn\\u2019t considered in the design of the jets. \\u2026 Another priority for Calhoun will be repairing Boeing\\u2019s corporate culture following recent revelations that employees had mocked regulators, bragged about persuading an airline not to require training and described its airplane as \\u2018designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The debacle has cost the company more than $25 billion: \\u201c Boeing Co. bill for the 737 MAX grounding could balloon to more than $25 billion, analysts estimated on Wednesday, a day after the U.S. plane maker warned of further delay in returning its once best-selling jet to service, \\u201d \\u2019 Ankit Ajmera reports.\\n\\n\\u2014 Complaint says FAA had lower bar for Southwest: \\u201cU.S. air-safety regulators likely acted improperly in the way they authorized Southwest Airlines Co. to begin flights between California and Hawaii last year, according to the main government agency that handles federal whistleblower complaints,\\u201d WSJ\\u2019s Andy Pasztor and Alison Sider report.\\n\\n\\u201cThe preliminary conclusion by the Office of Special Counsel pertains to a Federal Aviation Administration employee\\u2019s allegations that agency managers gave the carrier preferential treatment by rushing the approval process and cutting corners in other ways. The counsel\\u2019s staff \\u2018found a substantial likelihood of wrongdoing\\u2019 by FAA employees, according to one document, among several documents and emails between staff and the whistleblower reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The inquiry hasn\\u2019t been made public.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u2014 TikTok looks for new CEO: \\u201cChinese Internet giant ByteDance Inc. is seeking a new chief executive officer for its TikTok business, a hugely popular video app that American politicians have targeted as a potential security threat,\\u201d Bloomberg\\u2019s Kurt Wagner and Sarah Fryer report.\\n\\n\\u201cThe company has interviewed candidates in recent months for the CEO role, which would be based in the U.S., according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the search is private.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u2014 Tech giants are spending big money on lobbying: \\u201cTen years ago, Google executives rarely spoke to Congress.

Nationwide, 16.4 million workers were represented by a union last year, up by just 3,000 from 2018.\\n\\nThe share of U.S. workers represented by a union declined slightly, to 11.6%, from 11.7% in 2018. The drop can be partly attributed to the fact that, as the job market expanded, the number of workers entering the labor force grew faster than the number represented by unions: 1.2% vs 0.02%.\\n\\nHistorically, however, unions have suffered a steep decline: in 1979, 27% of U.S. workers were unionized.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe waning can be partly attributed to slower growth in industries with traditionally strong unions. Manufacturing companies from aerospace to automobiles have expanded in less labor-friendly Southern states and have outsourced blue-collar jobs to foreign countries.\\n\\nIn a paper analyzing the BLS numbers, Heidi Shierholz, senior economist for the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute, a labor think tank, suggested that \\u201cthe erosion of union coverage is not because workers don\\u2019t want unions anymore \\u2014 survey data show a higher share of nonunion workers today say they would vote for a union than was the case 40 years ago,\\u201d she wrote.\\n\\nRather, she contended, the drop is the result of \\u201cfierce corporate opposition\\u201d and weak federal penalties for intimidating and firing pro-union employees. \\u201cIt is now standard for employers to hire union avoidance consultants to coordinate intense anti-union campaigns,\\u201d she added, citing an EPI study estimating corporate spending of $340 million per year on union avoidance.\\n\\nThe corporate pushback is reflected in the fact that union membership is five times higher among public employees than private-sector workers. In 2019, the share of public-sector workers represented by a union held steady at 37.2%. The share of private-sector workers represented by a union ticked down to 7.1%, from 7.2%.\\n\\nA June 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Janus v. AFSCME, had been widely predicted as likely to weaken public-sector union membership. The decision barred state and local unions from charging workers \\u201cfair share fees\\u201d when they decline to join, but nonetheless enjoy raises and benefits as a result of collective bargaining.\\n\\nHowever, the new BLS data show no clear \\u201cJanus\\u201d effect. Union membership did drop among local government workers last year, from 40.3% to 39.4%. But it was offset by the share of unionized state government workers, which rose from 28.6% to 29.4%.\\n\\nWithin the public sector, union membership was highest among police officers, firefighters, and teachers. Private-sector industries with high unionization rates included utilities, transportation and warehousing, and telecommunications.\\n\\nAmong full-time wage and salary workers, union members had median weekly earnings of $1,095 in 2019, while nonunion members had median weekly earnings of $892.\\n\\nHowever, the BLS noted, \\u201cIn addition to coverage by a collective bargaining agreement, these earnings differences reflect a variety of influences, including variations in the distributions of union members and nonunion employees by occupation, industry, age, firm size or geographic region.\\u201d\\n\\nMore than half of union members in the U.S. lived in just seven states \\u2014 California, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio and Washington \\u2014 the BLS said, although these states accounted for only about one-third of U.S. employment.\\n\\nThe states with the highest percentage of represented workers last year were Hawaii (25.5%), New York (22.7%), Washington (20.2%), Rhode Island (19.0%) and Alaska (18.7%). The states with the smallest shares were South Carolina (2.7%), North Carolina (3.4%), Georgia (5.0%), Virginia (5.2%) and Texas (5.2%).\\n\\nUnion membership in 2019 was similar among men and women: 10.8% vs 9.7%. The gap has narrowed considerably since 1983 \\u2014 the earliest year of comparable data \\u2014 when 24.7% of men and 14.6% of women were unionized.\\n\\nAmong major race and ethnic groups, black workers continued to have a higher union membership rate in 2019 (11.2%) than white workers (10.3%), Asians (8.8%s) or Latinos (8.9%).\\n\\nThe BLS data cover both union membership (6.2%) and workers who are represented by unions (7.1%) but not always members.
