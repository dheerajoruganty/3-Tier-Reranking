But he reassured him. \\u201cThis is America,\\u201d Vindman recalled telling his dad. \\u201cHere, right matters.\\u201d The audience broke into spontaneous applause.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, right is supposed to matter,\\u201d Schiff told senators last night in the 10 p.m. hour, wrapping up day two of his case against Trump, which he will conclude Friday afternoon. \\u201cIt\\u2019s what\\u2019s made us the greatest nation on Earth. No Constitution can protect us if right doesn\\u2019t matter anymore. You know you can\\u2019t trust this president to do what\\u2019s right for this country. You can trust that he will do what\\u2019s right for Donald Trump. He\\u2019ll do it now. He\\u2019ll do it for the next several months. He\\u2019ll do it in the election if he\\u2019s allowed to. This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Democrat from California has repeatedly praised Vindman and others for \\u201csticking their necks out\\u201d to answer questions about the president\\u2019s alleged Ukraine coercion campaign when his former bosses, including ex-national security adviser John Bolton, refused to come before the House. \\u201cI have such admiration for the fact they did,\\u201d Schiff said on Wednesday. \\u201cBut what would really vindicate that leap of faith \\u2026 is if we show the same courage. They risked everything\\u2014their careers\\u2014and, yes, I know what you are asked to decide may risk yours too, but if they could show the courage, so can we.\\u201d\\n\\nOver the course of several hours earlier in the afternoon, Schiff had laid out 10 separate arguments for why Trump\\u2019s push to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden was intended for the president\\u2019s personal benefit and not to advance the national interest. \\u201cWhen we\\u2019re done, we believe that we will have made the case overwhelmingly that the president is guilty,\\u201d Schiff said. \\u201cIs there really any doubt about this? I mean, do we really have any doubt about the facts here? Does anybody really question whether the president is capable of what he\\u2019s charged with? No one is really making the argument Donald Trump would never do such a thing \\u2026 because, of course, we know that he would.\\u201d\\n\\nVindman remains assigned to the White House, something that has drawn the continuing ire of pro-Trump commentators. Schiff thanked senators last night for \\u201ckeeping an open mind about all of the issues we are presenting.\\u201d But, after Schiff spoke, Senate Republican leaders privately expressed growing confidence that they can win the vote next week to block additional witnesses from being summoned to testify. It\\u2019s not clear whether Schiff\\u2019s calls for courage have pushed any Republican senators toward breaking with the president and their party leaders on the key votes coming up next week surrounding summoning witnesses or subpoenaing documents.\\n\\n-- Schiff spoke a few hours after Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), one of the jurors, questioned Vindman\\u2019s patriotism by propagating an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory from the fever swamps of the dark corners of the pro-Trump fringe Internet. Blackburn claimed that Vindman once badmouthed the United States to Russians while serving overseas. \\u201cAdam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot,\\u201d she tweeted. \\u201cHow patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America\\u2019s greatest enemy?\\u201d\\n\\nVindman\\u2019s lawyer, former ambassador David Pressman, accused Blackburn of defaming his client. \\u201cThat a member of the Senate \\u2014 at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility \\u2014 would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice,\\u201d Pressman emailed. \\u201cWhile Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\\u201d\\n\\nBlackburn isn\\u2019t backing down and tweeted another attack around 8 p.m. Trump himself retweeted her this morning. The senator, who won Bob Corker's seat after he retired in 2018, has also accused Vindman of being a \\u201chandler\\u201d for the whistleblower who filed the complaint. Vindman testified before Schiff\\u2019s committee that he spoke with an intelligence community official about Trump\\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he declined to identify the official on the advice of counsel because he said he didn\\u2019t want to blow someone\\u2019s cover. But no public evidence exists that he was a source for the whistleblower.\\n\\n-- Schiff, a mild-mannered former federal prosecutor, has emerged as a surprisingly polarizing figure. Perhaps it\\u2019s because the president has accused him of committing treason, in addition to calling him \\u201cpencil neck\\u201d and \\u201cliddle.\\u201d Trump has now tweeted about Schiff hundreds of times. Schiff\\u2019s boosters say the right only loathes him because he\\u2019s so effective.\\n\\n-- The president\\u2019s allies at Fox News have elevated Schiff this week into perhaps the biggest boogeyman for their audience. Arguably he\\u2019s a bigger target of their vitriol right now than Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders or even the four minority women in the Squad. If you\\u2019ve watched the network for even a few minutes this week, especially in primetime, you\\u2019ve probably seen hosts and guests attacking the man from Burbank.\\n\\nTucker Carlson continued his mockery last night of the man he\\u2019s taken to calling \\u201cSaint Adam,\\u201d a nickname intended to convey what he portrays as the congressman\\u2019s sanctimoniousness. \\u201cSay what you will, but as a piece of theater, it had literally everything,\\u201d Carlson said after playing a video clip of Schiff talking on the Senate floor about how Trump\\u2019s approach to Ukraine has played into Russian President Vladimir Putin\\u2019s hands.\\n\\n\\u201cThey accused us of doing nefarious things with this Lev Parnas character,\\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told Sean Hannity. \\u201cThe truth is Adam Schiff and the Democrats have been doing nefarious things with Parnas!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAdam's ordinarily not that stupid, but when you tell the jury, the Senate, on one day that they're corrupt, and then you tell the American people they cannot be trusted to pick the commander in chief, that's just a wildly stupid trial strategy,\\u201d former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told Bret Baier.\\n\\n-- Rudy Giuliani appeared on \\u201cFox & Friends\\u201d this morning to attack the Democratic managers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a complete show on the part of the Democrats, and they should be sued for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and they should pay for that hearing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to present over the next two to three weeks shocking crimes at the highest levels of both governments while the Senate is listening to a totally phony group of stories about non-impeachable offenses.\\u201d\\n\\nGiuliani has been promising for a while now to release said evidence. It has not been forthcoming, so take such claims with more than a grain of salt. The president\\u2019s lawyer also said for months that he was going to release a lengthy report rebutting former special counsel Bob Mueller\\u2019s findings on Russian interference and whether Trump obstructed justice. He never did.\\n\\n-- Meanwhile, thought leaders on the left have effusively praised Schiff's performance. Esquire\\u2019s Charlie Pierce calls Schiff the Daniel Webster of our time. Walter Dellinger, who was acting U.S. solicitor general under Bill Clinton, said Schiff offered \\u201cone of the most impressive performances by a lawyer I have ever seen.\\u201d MSNBC legal commentator Jason Johnson called Schiff\\u2019s opening statement on Wednesday \\u201ca speech that kids will be giving in 2060 at university projects.\\u201d Actress and activist Alyssa Milano, who has been attending the trial, said \\u201cit felt like you were watching a one-man show on Broadway.\\u201d\\n\\nStephen Colbert offered an early valentine to Schiff during his show. \\u201cIt was gratifying to see someone taking the constitutional responsibility of their office seriously,\\u201d the comedian told his viewers on CBS. Breaking out of character, he said that Schiff spoke \\u201cclearly, passionately, cogently, and, I believe, courageously.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Schiff \\u201cwell spoken\\u201d and said \\u201cdid a good job of creating a tapestry.\\u201d But other Republican senators have told reporters that Schiff was overly \\u201csmooth\\u201d or \\u201cslick,\\u201d which they meant as negatives. \\u201cIn a way I do feel like I\\u2019m introducing myself to a number of the senators,\\u201d Schiff told the Associated Press, adding that they\\u2019re \\u201cfinding I\\u2019m not the demon that I\\u2019m portrayed as on Fox.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope that four Republicans still might be persuaded to vote for witnesses. \\u201cJust about every Republican\\u2019s eyes were glued on Mr. Schiff,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a powerful rendition.\\u201d\\n\\n-- All eyes are on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). \\u201cPrivately, senior Senate Republicans expect the vote to seek witness testimony to fail, but they are watching Alexander and several other Republicans closely. And wherever Alexander comes down is almost sure to be the majority position in the Senate,\\u201d Politico reports. \\u201cHe's a retiring defender of the Senate as an institution who's occasionally bucked his party, but he also counts Mitch McConnell as a longtime ally. He's more hesitant to criticize Trump than are some other Republicans, but he also has said it was \\u2018inappropriate\\u2019 for Trump to ask foreign governments to investigate his political opponents. \\u2026 [Democrats] are holding out hope that Alexander will be their hero in the mold of the late Sen. John McCain, whose extraordinary vote derailed the GOP\\u2019s effort to repeal Obamacare.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump is keeping his distance from the Republicans who might vote to call witnesses after White House advisers warned the president that outreach wouldn\\u2019t help his cause. Democrats are also giving them space. Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report: \\u201cDemocrats say there is no serious effort to privately lobby the Republicans, with the party relying instead on public opinion and the House prosecutors to squeeze them into breaking ranks.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) played with blue and purple fidget spinners. These are popular toys for children. In contrast, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who will potentially cast decisive votes on witnesses, almost never moved from their second-row desks. \\u201cCollins is a furious note taker, while Murkowski just stares intensely at the speaker,\\u201d Paul Kane reports.\\n\\n-- Collins sent a handwritten note to Roberts before his admonishment of the lawyers for both sides in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The senior senator for Maine, facing a tough reelection fight, told WCSH-TV in her state that the debate had become \\u201ctoo personal,\\u201d and she said she got mad when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Senate Republicans of being part of a coverup. \\u201cI had heard both sides impugn the integrity of one another and also cast aspersions on the Senate,\\u201d Collins said. \\u201cThat is just not appropriate.\\u201d Collins said she\\u2019s undecided on witnesses but added that the Nadler comments won\\u2019t affect her decision.\\n\\n-- Fresh polling shows most Americans overwhelmingly think witnesses should testify. An AP-NORC poll shows that 7 in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his top aides to appear before the Senate, including most Republicans. The same survey found that 45 percent think Trump should be convicted, 40 percent said he should not be and 14 percent said they don\\u2019t know enough to have an opinion.\\n\\n-- But, but, but: \\u201cMitch McConnell doesn\\u2019t care what you think,\\u201d Ben Terris writes in a new profile of the majority leader. \\u201cHe just wants to win.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A growing number of Republican senators are pointing to Trump's threat to invoke executive privilege as an excuse to vote against even trying to call witnesses, CNN reports: \\u201cGOP senators are privately and publicly raising concerns that issuing subpoenas -- to top officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton and for documents blocked by the White House -- will only serve to drag out the proceedings. Plus, many say there's little appetite for such a time-consuming fight, given that legal battles may ultimately not be successful and could force the courts to rule on hugely consequential constitutional issues about the separation of powers between the branches of government.\\u201d\\n\\nMORE FROM THE TRIAL:\\n\\n-- Democrats used a significant chunk of time on Thursday to preemptively defend the Bidens, who they expect Trump\\u2019s lawyers to attack when they get the floor: \\u201cRep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine,\\u201d Seung Min Kim, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. \\u201cBut Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump\\u2019s defense team. \\u2026 Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn\\u2019t focus on Biden\\u2019s actions toward Ukraine until 2019 \\u2026 She also referenced a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \\u2026 and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden\\u2019s desire to see [prosecutor Viktor] Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy \\u2026 As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cBefore the trial officially began Thursday afternoon, dozens of senators from both parties entered a secure facility in the Senate basement to view a classified document provided by Jennifer Williams, a national security adviser to Vice President Pence. \\u2026 The document had been previously submitted to the House Intelligence Committee. Some senators spent only a few minutes in the facility; others stayed for the better part of an hour. Several Democrats emerged to say they didn\\u2019t understand why the document had been classified. \\u2018I don\\u2019t believe it\\u2019s being withheld from the public for national security reasons. It may be withheld for political security reasons,\\u2019 said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).\\u201d\\n\\n-- The favorite talking point for most Senate Republicans continues to be that they\\u2019re learning nothing new because House managers are repeating themselves. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters during last night\\u2019s dinner break that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day in the Senate.\\u201d Ironically, he had repeated throughout the day that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day.\\u201d He said the same thing to CNN in the morning.\\n\\n\\u201cFor them to say they\\u2019re bored, it has a lot to do with them not wanting to hear evidence,\\u201d countered Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \\u201cThey don\\u2019t want to hear that this president who they\\u2019re so busy supporting did these things. As I put it, the truth hurts.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Tomorrow\\u2019s timing: Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) tells reporters that Saturday\\u2019s session will likely start and end earlier than the past few days. Party leaders are still trying to negotiate a deal to start the day as early as 8 a.m. so they can wrap up by noon. This would allow Democratic presidential candidates to fly to Iowa for campaign events. The trial has started at 1 p.m. during the week so that Chief Justice John Roberts can participate in pre-scheduled Supreme Court oral arguments before crossing the street to preside over the trial in the Capitol.\\n\\n-- Pelosi may be half a world away from the Senate floor, but that doesn\\u2019t mean the speaker doesn\\u2019t have the trial under control. From the Times: \\u201cEven in her absence from the Capitol this week, as the speaker traveled through Poland and Israel \\u2026 she had her hand firmly on the tiller. \\u2026 In many ways, Ms. Pelosi is the eighth, largely unseen manager of the Democrats\\u2019 case. \\u2026 Ms. Pelosi has dispatched her handpicked House general counsel to sit at the table inside the Senate chamber, with the prosecutors acting as her eyes and ears. She reviewed all the managers\\u2019 written briefs before they were filed.\\\"\\n\\n-- A core argument from Democrats yesterday was that the framers didn\\u2019t believe a president needed to break the law in order to warrant impeachment. \\u201cThe Constitution is not a suicide pact,\\u201d said Nadler, one of the managers. \\u201cIt does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The House\\u2019s lawyers filed a motion with an appeals court last night that says Trump\\u2019s defense lawyers have contradicted, and therefore undermined, the Department of Justice\\u2019s position on subpoenas. Ann Marimow reports: \\u201cThe lawyers for [Pelosi] asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to rule quickly on the pair of separation-of-powers cases, which they said could affect the Senate proceedings. House Democrats went to court seeking testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn and access to secret grand jury evidence from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\\u2019s Russia investigation. Justice Department attorneys have urged the appeals court to stay out of what they say are political disputes between Congress and the White House.\\u201d But the president\\u2019s team is now telling the Senate that these are matters more properly left to the courts.\\n\\n-- The White House also stonewalled the Government Accountability Office when the independent congressional watchdog requested information about the freeze on Ukraine aid. From Politico: \\u201cThe White House responded to the [GAO\\u2019s] inquiry with a one-page letter on Dec. 20, citing a legal memo from the Office of Management and Budget that defended the hold on military aid as necessary to ensure spending the funds wouldn't \\u2018conflict with the President's foreign policy.\\u2019 \\u2026 The correspondence is part of what led GAO to \\u2026 conclude last week that Trump's decision to withhold military aid violated federal law.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Follow the money: The documents turned over by Lev Parnas, Giuliani\\u2019s former associate, provide details about the web of dark money that helped fund Trump\\u2019s Ukrainian gambit. From Bloomberg News: \\u201cMoney flowed to Giuliani and his cohorts from home loans, friends, relative strangers and wealthy businessmen, some with interests in the gas and energy sector. It even came from a lawyer for an embattled Ukrainian energy tycoon fighting extradition to the U.S. on a conspiracy charge. \\u2026 The travel arrangements could brush up against campaign finance laws. While Giuliani [and Parnas] can volunteer as much of their time as they want for a campaign, any subsidy for such work by third parties would generally need to be reported as a contribution, and money from foreign individuals would be illegal.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dana Milbank: \\\"John Roberts comes face to face with the mess he made.\\\"\\n\\u2022 Ruth Marcus: \\u201cA more assertive John Roberts would be a bad idea.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Brenda Wineapple, author of a book on Andrew Johnson\\u2019s impeachment: \\u201cIf John Roberts is seeking a role model, let\\u2019s hope it\\u2019s not Salmon Chase.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Michael Gerson: \\u201cRepublicans aren\\u2019t serving the country, or even the president. Just themselves.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Eugene Robinson: \\u201cSenate Republicans\\u2019 defense of Trump is as mushy as apple pie.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Garret Graff, founding director of the Aspen Institute\\u2019s Cyber & Technology Program: \\u201cTrump won\\u2019t protect our elections, so private companies are doing it.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dan Drezner: \\u201cWhen American political institutions give up: After three years of Trump, there have been some unhealthy adjustments.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Regional radio hosts across the country have found themselves showered with attention by senior Trump officials, who have made accessibility to local conservative talking heads a central part of the president\\u2019s reelection strategy. Sarah Ellison reports: \\u201cPouring attention on regional talk-radio hosts is a classic Trumpworld move: giving relatively unknown characters proximity to the White House has paid off with a disproportionate amount of attention and praise lavished on the president and his agenda. \\u2026 The strategy has been particularly powerful as Trump and his team have engaged in what [Steve] Bannon calls \\u2018information warfare\\u2019 over the impeachment fight...\\u201d\\n\\n-- Kamala \\\"that-little-girl-was-me\\\" Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joe Biden to boost her standing in the veepstakes. From the New York Times: \\u201cSuch a move could lift Mr. Biden\\u2019s campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris\\u2019s chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California. An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial \\u2026 She and [Biden] have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Anita Hill told an Iowa crowd last night that it\\u2019s too late for Biden to apologize for the way he mistreated and diminished her when she testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991. \\u201cThe statute of limitations for his apology is up,\\u201d Hill said in response to a question from the audience at the University of Iowa, where she gave a lecture on ending sexual harassment. \\u201cWhat are you going to do about it? What are you going to do today? Will you promise as leader of this country \\u2026 to use all of your energy to address the problem as it happened and to prevent it from happening to another generation? That\\u2019s what I want to hear. And I not only want to hear from him, I want to hear from every one of them who want to be the leader of this country.\\u201d (BuzzFeed News)\\n\\n-- Bernie Sanders asked his supporters to cool it \\u2013 but they don\\u2019t always listen. Sean Sullivan reports: \\u201cCampaign officials have been pressing surrogates and other allies not to escalate combustible disputes that have recently become more personal, ... including a tense fight with Joe Biden, a separate altercation with [Elizabeth Warren] and a renewed schism with Hillary Clinton. \\u2026 But many Sanders supporters, and even some campaign aides, are inclined to take a more aggressive approach that they say will highlight important differences. \\u2026 Some close Sanders allies acknowledged the difficulty of balancing the passions of his loyal backers, inspired by his calls for a political revolution and his staunchly liberal platform, with the need to demonstrate a broader unity.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sanders\\u2019s rise in the polls means he\\u2019ll be talking more about his electability than a revolution. While speeches he\\u2019s made over the past two weeks still feature his signature call to action, he\\u2019s spending more time explaining to voters how policies like Medicare-for-all would work in their daily lives, as well as how he could beat Trump. (Bloomberg News)\\n\\n-- One in five women doubt that a woman can win the presidency, according to a new CNN poll. What\\u2019s telling about this news is that just 9 percent of men said the same. (Eugene Scott)\\n\\n-- Mike Bloomberg may be lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, but he\\u2019s attracted the president\\u2019s obsessive attention by baiting him with constant attack ads. Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer report: \\u201cThe president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him \\u2018Mini Mike\\u2019 to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials. \\u2018It\\u2019s very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,\\u2019 said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide \\u2026 Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. \\u2026 Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on \\u2018Fox & Friends\\u2019 on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as \\u2018dopes and babies.\\u2019 Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Former top supporters of Cory Booker accused Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s campaign of \\u201cchasing ambulances.\\u201d From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cThe phone calls to Amy Nielsen came around two hours apart. It was last Monday around 12 p.m., not long after the news broke, when her phone lit up with his name. By then, Nielsen considered Cory Booker \\u2018part of [her] family.\\u2019 \\u2026 So the end of his campaign felt \\u2026 like \\u2018a death.\\u2019 \\u2026 The next call came around 2:30 p.m., this time from an unknown number. It was Pete Buttigieg, calling to seek Nielsen\\u2019s support now that her candidate had made the decision to \\u2018step aside.\\u2019 \\u2026 \\u2018It was a gut punch \\u2014 like, really? He did not \\u2018step aside\\u2019 for you,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Like, wow, that\\u2019s some nerve right there.\\u2019 Later that night, she said, Nielsen heard from one of Booker\\u2019s field organizers who said she had already been contacted by the Buttigieg campaign to go door-knock.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Twelve years ago, Buttigieg spent the final week before the 2008 caucuses in rural southwest Iowa, trying to turn out voters for Barack Obama in one of the most conservative towns in the state. Holly Bailey spoke with him about what he learned: \\u201c\\u2018This was a new experience to really talk to people like this,\\u2019 Buttigieg recalled. \\u2018And what I found was, first of all, you can\\u2019t assume where somebody is going to be. We were in an area where a lot of people weren\\u2019t Democrats to begin with, and those who were were more likely to be for [John] Edwards. But they would hear us out when we were talking about Obama. And sometimes, as you do when you go door-to-door, somebody, because you represent a presidential campaign, would just pour out everything that was on their mind, everything they were upset about.\\\"\\n\\n\\u00ad-- Early voting means that millions are already eligible to cast their ballot. From the AP: \\u201cIn Minnesota, in-person early voting began Jan. 17. Vermont\\u2019s deadline to mail out its absentee ballots was the same day. Many of the 14 Super Tuesday states will offer some form of early voting between now and mid-February.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Howard County saw a bigger swing from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 than any other in Iowa. The Wall Street Journal's John McCormick took the pulse for 2020: \\u201cRecent interviews with dozens of voters here suggest that most of Mr. Trump\\u2019s 2016 supporters ... plan to stick with him, even though some said they have grown weary of his personal behavior and trade fights. Among those who previously voted for Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, many said they are reserving judgment until they see who wins the Democratic nomination. \\u2026 What such swing voters do in 2020 will have national implications. Before Mr. Trump, Howard County hadn\\u2019t backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. It is one of the 31 counties in Iowa\\u2014the most of any state\\u2014that backed Mr. Obama twice and then switched to Mr. Trump. The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A new Iowa caucus app is sparking election security concerns. From NBC News: \\u201cThe app will be used in Iowa and Nevada by caucus managers \\u2014 local registered Democrats who sign up to organize and run the caucus process in each location \\u2014 to expedite the process, calculate and assign delegates and report results back quickly. The app will also be used in satellite voting locations across the country and overseas. But questions about the app remain unanswered, including who developed it and whether it has been subjected to independent security testing. Security experts say that the app is a potential target for early election interference, particularly since it is downloaded on to the personal phones of the caucus managers. Party officials say operational security prevents them from disclosing specifics about the app.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Big-money groups aligned with the Senate GOP raised $68.3 million in 2019, an off-year record. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \\u201cThe majority of the money raised in 2019 came in the latter half of the year, particularly in the final two months, largely driven by the House Democrats\\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The ranks of scientists are growing thin in the Trump administration. Annie Gowen, Juliet Eilperin, Ben Guarino and Andrew Ba Tran report: \\u201cDozens of government computers sit in a nondescript building [in Kansas City, Mo.], able to connect to a data model that could help farmers manage the impact of a changing climate on their crops. But no one in this federal agency would know how to access the model, or, if they did, what to do with the data. That\\u2019s because the ambitious federal researcher who created it in Washington quit rather than move when the Agriculture Department relocated his agency to an office park here last fall. He is one of hundreds of scientists across the federal government who have been forced out, sidelined or muted since President Trump took office. \\u2026 In the first two years of the Trump administration, more than 1,600 federal scientists left government, according to Office of Personnel Management employment data \\u2026 That represents a 1.5 percent drop, compared with the 8 percent increase during the same period in the Obama administration.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Justice Department conceded that it had \\u201cinsufficient\\u201d cause to continue monitoring a former Trump campaign adviser during the Russia probe. Matt Zapotosky reports: \\u201cThe concession was revealed in an order posted on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\\u2019s website. In December, according to the order, the department told the court it had come to believe that in at least two of the four applications to monitor the former adviser, Carter Page, \\u2018there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause\\u2019 to believe he was acting as a Russian agent.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Trump administration will create additional new hurdles for pregnant foreign women seeking U.S. tourist visas. The administration said it's trying to crack down on what it calls \\u201cbirth tourism,\\\" trying to reduce what conservatives call \\\"anchor babies,\\\" by instructing consular officers to assess whether women requesting tourist visas are hoping to give birth on U.S. soil, which would effectively grant their children American citizenship. Starting today, the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor visas to women hoping to travel to the country with the stated purpose of having a child. Foggy Bottom said consular officers cannot require pregnancy tests to make the determination but wouldn\\u2019t rule out a woman\\u2019s physical appearance when making the decision, per Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti.\\n\\n-- Trump's \\\"national public health emergency\\\" declaration on the opioid crisis expired because his people at the Department of Health and Human Services forgot to renew it. An HHS spokesperson said the nine-day lapse had been corrected and blamed a clerical error. The emergency status, first announced in 2017 as a measure deemed necessary to direct more resources toward the drug overdose crisis, needs to be renewed every 90 days. (Politico)\\n\\n-- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, 17, needs to study economics before offering her thoughts on climate change. Heather Long reports from Davos: \\u201cThunberg and Mnuchin are both attending the World Economic Forum this week. \\u2026 At a news conference on Thursday, Mnuchin was asked for his reaction to Thunberg\\u2019s insistence on fossil fuel divestment. \\u2018Who is she?\\u2019 he tried to joke to reporters before taking a jab at Thunberg, suggesting she didn\\u2019t understand what she was talking about. \\u2026 \\u2018Is she the chief economist or who is she? I\\u2019m confused. ...

Shayna Jacobs reports: \\u201c\\u2018I was punching him. I was kicking him. I was just trying to get him away from me, and he took my hands and put them over my head,\\u2019 Sciorra told the jury in Weinstein\\u2019s sexual assault trial, her eyes welling up with tears and her voice breaking. \\u2026 Weinstein, who had been watching her from the defense table, turned his gaze away from his accuser as she emotionally detailed the encounter. \\u2026 In her five hours of testimony, she described freezing after the attack, adding that \\u2018It was just so disgusting that my body started to shake.\\u2019 She said she had no romantic interest in Weinstein. The film producer arrived at her Manhattan apartment uninvited one night.\\u201d\\n\\n-- \\u201cA young, healthy man from Wuhan and a person living 1,500 miles from the epicenter of the coronavirus are among the latest victims of the outbreak, which has incited fear and anger across China as the important Spring Festival gets underway,\\u201d Anna Fifield reports from Beijing. \\u201cReports of eight new deaths from the pneumonia-like virus, taking the total to 26, came as authorities enforced a lockdown across large parts of the province of Hubei, population 59 million. But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies. Adding to the stress, Friday marked the official start of \\u2026 when China celebrates the arrival of the new lunar year. Authorities around the country, including in the capital Beijing, have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the holiday to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could be spread. \\u2026The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was already entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice. Production companies have postponed the release of seven blockbuster films that were to be released over the holiday, leading Chinese cinema companies to close the country\\u2019s 70,000 movie theaters. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cThe National Health Commission reported Friday that there are now more than 830 confirmed cases of infection, and reports of new cases continued to roll in from around the country: from Xinjiang in the west to Shandong in the east, from Inner Mongolia in the north to Hainan in the south. A total of 8,420 were reported to be under observation. South Korean authorities confirmed Friday that a second person tested positive for the new coronavirus. \\u2026 Japan also confirmed a second case, a man in his 40s from Wuhan who arrived in Japan on Sunday on a flight through Hong Kong. Other countries to have reported infections including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to a confirmed case in Washington state, Texas has reported a potential case of coronavirus in Brazos County, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The patient contracted a respiratory illness within two weeks of traveling in Wuhan and is being isolated at home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\\n\\n\\u201cSome details about the latest deaths in China have raised concerns about the virus\\u2019s spread. Until now, the vast majority of the people had been older than 60 and almost all of them had existing health conditions. All of them had been in Hubei province \\u2026 But the latest announcement said that 36-year-old man from Wuhan, identified only by his family name, Li, died on Thursday. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions, and had been treated with anti-virus medication and antibiotics since being admitted to a hospital on Jan. 9.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Wall Street stumbled yesterday amid fears that efforts to curtail the virus could further disrupt the global economy. (David Lynch)\\n\\n-- The U.S. has officially refused to extradite Anne Sacoolas, the diplomat\\u2019s wife who fled the U.K. to avoid facing charges for killing a British teen by driving on the wrong side of the road. A State Department spokesman said extraditing Sacoolas would \\u201cset an extraordinarily troubling precedent\\u201d but did not elaborate. (Meagan Flynn)\\n\\n-- Trump\\u2019s sanctions on Iran are fueling a new refugee crisis \\u2013 in Turkey. Erin Cunningham and Mohammad Mahdi Sultani report: \\u201cDecades ago, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted thousands of people to flee to neighboring Iran. Now, many of these refugees are once again seeking a new home in a new land, Turkey, desperate to escape the dire economic conditions fueled by U.S. sanctions on Tehran. \\u2026 Turkish authorities are grappling with nearly 4 million refugees. This is the world\\u2019s largest population of displaced people, according to the United Nations, including more than 170,000 registered Afghan refugees. Turkey has struggled to contain the influx even as aid agencies say the number of arrivals from Iran is on the rise.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A critic of the Saudi Arabian government said a suspected Saudi agent tried to kidnap him on U.S. soil, a claim backed up by multiple U.S. and foreign sources familiar with the episode. From the Daily Beast: \\u201cAbdulrahman Almutairi is a 27-year-old comedian and former student at the University of San Diego with a big social-media presence. After Almutairi used social media to criticize the powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman over the October 2018 murder and dismemberment of Washington Post contributor [Jamal] Khashoggi, an unidentified Saudi man accompanied Almutairi\\u2019s father on a flight to collect Almutairi against his will and bring him back to Saudi Arabia...\\\"\\n\\n-- The Trump administration has missed the deadline, established by law, to turn over to Congress an unclassified report on Khashoggi's murder and the role played by the regime in Riyadh. From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cIn December, lawmakers passed a sweeping defense bill that included a provision ordering the director of national intelligence to send Congress an unclassified report identifying those responsible for Khashoggi\\u2019s death at a Saudi Arabian consulate in 2018. The legislation set the deadline for the report at 30 days, which passed earlier this week.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A small team of FBI agents spent years trying to solve a stubborn mystery \\u2013 whether officials from Saudi Arabia were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. A team of ProPublica and NYT Magazine reporters tell their story: \\u201cThe FBI has disputed the idea that foreign-policy considerations significantly influenced its investigation. In interviews, current and former bureau officials and federal prosecutors insisted to us that they never would have hesitated to pursue any Saudi who could have been solidly linked to the 9/11 plot \\u2026 But others who worked on the matter, including some at the FBI\\u2019s highest levels, say that the United States\\u2019 complex and often-troubled relationship with the Saudi regime was an unavoidable fact throughout their investigations. Even as the Saudi authorities became more cooperative with the United States in fighting al-Qaida after 2003, they were minimally and grudgingly helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry. According to current and former officials, requests for assistance that might rattle the Saudi security agencies were frequently balanced against FBI and CIA needs for Saudi help against continuing terror threats.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival, Benny Gantz, next week to discuss his Middle East peace plan.

Col. Alexander Vindman as the model of courage that Senate Republicans should follow during President Trump's trial.\\n\\nThe House Intelligence chairman fought back emotion late last night as he recalled Vindman\\u2019s November appearance before his committee. Vindman was born in the Soviet Union, but his father brought him here when he was a young boy. The director of European Affairs on the National Security Council, who received a Purple Heart after he was injured in Iraq, said that his father worried when he told him he would testify. But he reassured him. \\u201cThis is America,\\u201d Vindman recalled telling his dad. \\u201cHere, right matters.\\u201d The audience broke into spontaneous applause.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, right is supposed to matter,\\u201d Schiff told senators last night in the 10 p.m. hour, wrapping up day two of his case against Trump, which he will conclude Friday afternoon. \\u201cIt\\u2019s what\\u2019s made us the greatest nation on Earth. No Constitution can protect us if right doesn\\u2019t matter anymore. You know you can\\u2019t trust this president to do what\\u2019s right for this country. You can trust that he will do what\\u2019s right for Donald Trump. He\\u2019ll do it now. He\\u2019ll do it for the next several months. He\\u2019ll do it in the election if he\\u2019s allowed to. This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Democrat from California has repeatedly praised Vindman and others for \\u201csticking their necks out\\u201d to answer questions about the president\\u2019s alleged Ukraine coercion campaign when his former bosses, including ex-national security adviser John Bolton, refused to come before the House. \\u201cI have such admiration for the fact they did,\\u201d Schiff said on Wednesday. \\u201cBut what would really vindicate that leap of faith \\u2026 is if we show the same courage. They risked everything\\u2014their careers\\u2014and, yes, I know what you are asked to decide may risk yours too, but if they could show the courage, so can we.\\u201d\\n\\nOver the course of several hours earlier in the afternoon, Schiff had laid out 10 separate arguments for why Trump\\u2019s push to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden was intended for the president\\u2019s personal benefit and not to advance the national interest. \\u201cWhen we\\u2019re done, we believe that we will have made the case overwhelmingly that the president is guilty,\\u201d Schiff said. \\u201cIs there really any doubt about this? I mean, do we really have any doubt about the facts here? Does anybody really question whether the president is capable of what he\\u2019s charged with? No one is really making the argument Donald Trump would never do such a thing \\u2026 because, of course, we know that he would.\\u201d\\n\\nVindman remains assigned to the White House, something that has drawn the continuing ire of pro-Trump commentators. Schiff thanked senators last night for \\u201ckeeping an open mind about all of the issues we are presenting.\\u201d But, after Schiff spoke, Senate Republican leaders privately expressed growing confidence that they can win the vote next week to block additional witnesses from being summoned to testify. It\\u2019s not clear whether Schiff\\u2019s calls for courage have pushed any Republican senators toward breaking with the president and their party leaders on the key votes coming up next week surrounding summoning witnesses or subpoenaing documents.\\n\\n-- Schiff spoke a few hours after Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), one of the jurors, questioned Vindman\\u2019s patriotism by propagating an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory from the fever swamps of the dark corners of the pro-Trump fringe Internet. Blackburn claimed that Vindman once badmouthed the United States to Russians while serving overseas. \\u201cAdam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot,\\u201d she tweeted. \\u201cHow patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America\\u2019s greatest enemy?\\u201d\\n\\nVindman\\u2019s lawyer, former ambassador David Pressman, accused Blackburn of defaming his client. \\u201cThat a member of the Senate \\u2014 at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility \\u2014 would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice,\\u201d Pressman emailed. \\u201cWhile Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\\u201d\\n\\nBlackburn isn\\u2019t backing down and tweeted another attack around 8 p.m. Trump himself retweeted her this morning. The senator, who won Bob Corker's seat after he retired in 2018, has also accused Vindman of being a \\u201chandler\\u201d for the whistleblower who filed the complaint. Vindman testified before Schiff\\u2019s committee that he spoke with an intelligence community official about Trump\\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he declined to identify the official on the advice of counsel because he said he didn\\u2019t want to blow someone\\u2019s cover. But no public evidence exists that he was a source for the whistleblower.\\n\\n-- Schiff, a mild-mannered former federal prosecutor, has emerged as a surprisingly polarizing figure. Perhaps it\\u2019s because the president has accused him of committing treason, in addition to calling him \\u201cpencil neck\\u201d and \\u201cliddle.\\u201d Trump has now tweeted about Schiff hundreds of times. Schiff\\u2019s boosters say the right only loathes him because he\\u2019s so effective.\\n\\n-- The president\\u2019s allies at Fox News have elevated Schiff this week into perhaps the biggest boogeyman for their audience. Arguably he\\u2019s a bigger target of their vitriol right now than Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders or even the four minority women in the Squad. If you\\u2019ve watched the network for even a few minutes this week, especially in primetime, you\\u2019ve probably seen hosts and guests attacking the man from Burbank.\\n\\nTucker Carlson continued his mockery last night of the man he\\u2019s taken to calling \\u201cSaint Adam,\\u201d a nickname intended to convey what he portrays as the congressman\\u2019s sanctimoniousness. \\u201cSay what you will, but as a piece of theater, it had literally everything,\\u201d Carlson said after playing a video clip of Schiff talking on the Senate floor about how Trump\\u2019s approach to Ukraine has played into Russian President Vladimir Putin\\u2019s hands.\\n\\n\\u201cThey accused us of doing nefarious things with this Lev Parnas character,\\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told Sean Hannity. \\u201cThe truth is Adam Schiff and the Democrats have been doing nefarious things with Parnas!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAdam's ordinarily not that stupid, but when you tell the jury, the Senate, on one day that they're corrupt, and then you tell the American people they cannot be trusted to pick the commander in chief, that's just a wildly stupid trial strategy,\\u201d former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told Bret Baier.\\n\\n-- Rudy Giuliani appeared on \\u201cFox & Friends\\u201d this morning to attack the Democratic managers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a complete show on the part of the Democrats, and they should be sued for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and they should pay for that hearing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to present over the next two to three weeks shocking crimes at the highest levels of both governments while the Senate is listening to a totally phony group of stories about non-impeachable offenses.\\u201d\\n\\nGiuliani has been promising for a while now to release said evidence. It has not been forthcoming, so take such claims with more than a grain of salt. The president\\u2019s lawyer also said for months that he was going to release a lengthy report rebutting former special counsel Bob Mueller\\u2019s findings on Russian interference and whether Trump obstructed justice. He never did.\\n\\n-- Meanwhile, thought leaders on the left have effusively praised Schiff's performance. Esquire\\u2019s Charlie Pierce calls Schiff the Daniel Webster of our time. Walter Dellinger, who was acting U.S. solicitor general under Bill Clinton, said Schiff offered \\u201cone of the most impressive performances by a lawyer I have ever seen.\\u201d MSNBC legal commentator Jason Johnson called Schiff\\u2019s opening statement on Wednesday \\u201ca speech that kids will be giving in 2060 at university projects.\\u201d Actress and activist Alyssa Milano, who has been attending the trial, said \\u201cit felt like you were watching a one-man show on Broadway.\\u201d\\n\\nStephen Colbert offered an early valentine to Schiff during his show. \\u201cIt was gratifying to see someone taking the constitutional responsibility of their office seriously,\\u201d the comedian told his viewers on CBS. Breaking out of character, he said that Schiff spoke \\u201cclearly, passionately, cogently, and, I believe, courageously.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Schiff \\u201cwell spoken\\u201d and said \\u201cdid a good job of creating a tapestry.\\u201d But other Republican senators have told reporters that Schiff was overly \\u201csmooth\\u201d or \\u201cslick,\\u201d which they meant as negatives. \\u201cIn a way I do feel like I\\u2019m introducing myself to a number of the senators,\\u201d Schiff told the Associated Press, adding that they\\u2019re \\u201cfinding I\\u2019m not the demon that I\\u2019m portrayed as on Fox.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope that four Republicans still might be persuaded to vote for witnesses. \\u201cJust about every Republican\\u2019s eyes were glued on Mr. Schiff,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a powerful rendition.\\u201d\\n\\n-- All eyes are on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). \\u201cPrivately, senior Senate Republicans expect the vote to seek witness testimony to fail, but they are watching Alexander and several other Republicans closely. And wherever Alexander comes down is almost sure to be the majority position in the Senate,\\u201d Politico reports. \\u201cHe's a retiring defender of the Senate as an institution who's occasionally bucked his party, but he also counts Mitch McConnell as a longtime ally. He's more hesitant to criticize Trump than are some other Republicans, but he also has said it was \\u2018inappropriate\\u2019 for Trump to ask foreign governments to investigate his political opponents. \\u2026 [Democrats] are holding out hope that Alexander will be their hero in the mold of the late Sen. John McCain, whose extraordinary vote derailed the GOP\\u2019s effort to repeal Obamacare.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump is keeping his distance from the Republicans who might vote to call witnesses after White House advisers warned the president that outreach wouldn\\u2019t help his cause. Democrats are also giving them space. Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report: \\u201cDemocrats say there is no serious effort to privately lobby the Republicans, with the party relying instead on public opinion and the House prosecutors to squeeze them into breaking ranks.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) played with blue and purple fidget spinners. These are popular toys for children. In contrast, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who will potentially cast decisive votes on witnesses, almost never moved from their second-row desks. \\u201cCollins is a furious note taker, while Murkowski just stares intensely at the speaker,\\u201d Paul Kane reports.\\n\\n-- Collins sent a handwritten note to Roberts before his admonishment of the lawyers for both sides in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The senior senator for Maine, facing a tough reelection fight, told WCSH-TV in her state that the debate had become \\u201ctoo personal,\\u201d and she said she got mad when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Senate Republicans of being part of a coverup. \\u201cI had heard both sides impugn the integrity of one another and also cast aspersions on the Senate,\\u201d Collins said. \\u201cThat is just not appropriate.\\u201d Collins said she\\u2019s undecided on witnesses but added that the Nadler comments won\\u2019t affect her decision.\\n\\n-- Fresh polling shows most Americans overwhelmingly think witnesses should testify. An AP-NORC poll shows that 7 in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his top aides to appear before the Senate, including most Republicans. The same survey found that 45 percent think Trump should be convicted, 40 percent said he should not be and 14 percent said they don\\u2019t know enough to have an opinion.\\n\\n-- But, but, but: \\u201cMitch McConnell doesn\\u2019t care what you think,\\u201d Ben Terris writes in a new profile of the majority leader. \\u201cHe just wants to win.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A growing number of Republican senators are pointing to Trump's threat to invoke executive privilege as an excuse to vote against even trying to call witnesses, CNN reports: \\u201cGOP senators are privately and publicly raising concerns that issuing subpoenas -- to top officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton and for documents blocked by the White House -- will only serve to drag out the proceedings. Plus, many say there's little appetite for such a time-consuming fight, given that legal battles may ultimately not be successful and could force the courts to rule on hugely consequential constitutional issues about the separation of powers between the branches of government.\\u201d\\n\\nMORE FROM THE TRIAL:\\n\\n-- Democrats used a significant chunk of time on Thursday to preemptively defend the Bidens, who they expect Trump\\u2019s lawyers to attack when they get the floor: \\u201cRep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine,\\u201d Seung Min Kim, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. \\u201cBut Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump\\u2019s defense team. \\u2026 Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn\\u2019t focus on Biden\\u2019s actions toward Ukraine until 2019 \\u2026 She also referenced a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \\u2026 and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden\\u2019s desire to see [prosecutor Viktor] Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy \\u2026 As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cBefore the trial officially began Thursday afternoon, dozens of senators from both parties entered a secure facility in the Senate basement to view a classified document provided by Jennifer Williams, a national security adviser to Vice President Pence. \\u2026 The document had been previously submitted to the House Intelligence Committee. Some senators spent only a few minutes in the facility; others stayed for the better part of an hour. Several Democrats emerged to say they didn\\u2019t understand why the document had been classified. \\u2018I don\\u2019t believe it\\u2019s being withheld from the public for national security reasons. It may be withheld for political security reasons,\\u2019 said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).\\u201d\\n\\n-- The favorite talking point for most Senate Republicans continues to be that they\\u2019re learning nothing new because House managers are repeating themselves. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters during last night\\u2019s dinner break that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day in the Senate.\\u201d Ironically, he had repeated throughout the day that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day.\\u201d He said the same thing to CNN in the morning.\\n\\n\\u201cFor them to say they\\u2019re bored, it has a lot to do with them not wanting to hear evidence,\\u201d countered Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \\u201cThey don\\u2019t want to hear that this president who they\\u2019re so busy supporting did these things. As I put it, the truth hurts.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Tomorrow\\u2019s timing: Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) tells reporters that Saturday\\u2019s session will likely start and end earlier than the past few days. Party leaders are still trying to negotiate a deal to start the day as early as 8 a.m. so they can wrap up by noon. This would allow Democratic presidential candidates to fly to Iowa for campaign events. The trial has started at 1 p.m. during the week so that Chief Justice John Roberts can participate in pre-scheduled Supreme Court oral arguments before crossing the street to preside over the trial in the Capitol.\\n\\n-- Pelosi may be half a world away from the Senate floor, but that doesn\\u2019t mean the speaker doesn\\u2019t have the trial under control. From the Times: \\u201cEven in her absence from the Capitol this week, as the speaker traveled through Poland and Israel \\u2026 she had her hand firmly on the tiller. \\u2026 In many ways, Ms. Pelosi is the eighth, largely unseen manager of the Democrats\\u2019 case. \\u2026 Ms. Pelosi has dispatched her handpicked House general counsel to sit at the table inside the Senate chamber, with the prosecutors acting as her eyes and ears. She reviewed all the managers\\u2019 written briefs before they were filed.\\\"\\n\\n-- A core argument from Democrats yesterday was that the framers didn\\u2019t believe a president needed to break the law in order to warrant impeachment. \\u201cThe Constitution is not a suicide pact,\\u201d said Nadler, one of the managers. \\u201cIt does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The House\\u2019s lawyers filed a motion with an appeals court last night that says Trump\\u2019s defense lawyers have contradicted, and therefore undermined, the Department of Justice\\u2019s position on subpoenas. Ann Marimow reports: \\u201cThe lawyers for [Pelosi] asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to rule quickly on the pair of separation-of-powers cases, which they said could affect the Senate proceedings. House Democrats went to court seeking testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn and access to secret grand jury evidence from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\\u2019s Russia investigation. Justice Department attorneys have urged the appeals court to stay out of what they say are political disputes between Congress and the White House.\\u201d But the president\\u2019s team is now telling the Senate that these are matters more properly left to the courts.\\n\\n-- The White House also stonewalled the Government Accountability Office when the independent congressional watchdog requested information about the freeze on Ukraine aid. From Politico: \\u201cThe White House responded to the [GAO\\u2019s] inquiry with a one-page letter on Dec. 20, citing a legal memo from the Office of Management and Budget that defended the hold on military aid as necessary to ensure spending the funds wouldn't \\u2018conflict with the President's foreign policy.\\u2019 \\u2026 The correspondence is part of what led GAO to \\u2026 conclude last week that Trump's decision to withhold military aid violated federal law.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Follow the money: The documents turned over by Lev Parnas, Giuliani\\u2019s former associate, provide details about the web of dark money that helped fund Trump\\u2019s Ukrainian gambit. From Bloomberg News: \\u201cMoney flowed to Giuliani and his cohorts from home loans, friends, relative strangers and wealthy businessmen, some with interests in the gas and energy sector. It even came from a lawyer for an embattled Ukrainian energy tycoon fighting extradition to the U.S. on a conspiracy charge. \\u2026 The travel arrangements could brush up against campaign finance laws. While Giuliani [and Parnas] can volunteer as much of their time as they want for a campaign, any subsidy for such work by third parties would generally need to be reported as a contribution, and money from foreign individuals would be illegal.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dana Milbank: \\\"John Roberts comes face to face with the mess he made.\\\"\\n\\u2022 Ruth Marcus: \\u201cA more assertive John Roberts would be a bad idea.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Brenda Wineapple, author of a book on Andrew Johnson\\u2019s impeachment: \\u201cIf John Roberts is seeking a role model, let\\u2019s hope it\\u2019s not Salmon Chase.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Michael Gerson: \\u201cRepublicans aren\\u2019t serving the country, or even the president.

Sarah Ellison reports: \\u201cPouring attention on regional talk-radio hosts is a classic Trumpworld move: giving relatively unknown characters proximity to the White House has paid off with a disproportionate amount of attention and praise lavished on the president and his agenda. \\u2026 The strategy has been particularly powerful as Trump and his team have engaged in what [Steve] Bannon calls \\u2018information warfare\\u2019 over the impeachment fight...\\u201d\\n\\n-- Kamala \\\"that-little-girl-was-me\\\" Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joe Biden to boost her standing in the veepstakes. From the New York Times: \\u201cSuch a move could lift Mr. Biden\\u2019s campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris\\u2019s chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California. An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial \\u2026 She and [Biden] have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Anita Hill told an Iowa crowd last night that it\\u2019s too late for Biden to apologize for the way he mistreated and diminished her when she testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991. \\u201cThe statute of limitations for his apology is up,\\u201d Hill said in response to a question from the audience at the University of Iowa, where she gave a lecture on ending sexual harassment. \\u201cWhat are you going to do about it? What are you going to do today? Will you promise as leader of this country \\u2026 to use all of your energy to address the problem as it happened and to prevent it from happening to another generation? That\\u2019s what I want to hear. And I not only want to hear from him, I want to hear from every one of them who want to be the leader of this country.\\u201d (BuzzFeed News)\\n\\n-- Bernie Sanders asked his supporters to cool it \\u2013 but they don\\u2019t always listen. Sean Sullivan reports: \\u201cCampaign officials have been pressing surrogates and other allies not to escalate combustible disputes that have recently become more personal, ... including a tense fight with Joe Biden, a separate altercation with [Elizabeth Warren] and a renewed schism with Hillary Clinton. \\u2026 But many Sanders supporters, and even some campaign aides, are inclined to take a more aggressive approach that they say will highlight important differences. \\u2026 Some close Sanders allies acknowledged the difficulty of balancing the passions of his loyal backers, inspired by his calls for a political revolution and his staunchly liberal platform, with the need to demonstrate a broader unity.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sanders\\u2019s rise in the polls means he\\u2019ll be talking more about his electability than a revolution. While speeches he\\u2019s made over the past two weeks still feature his signature call to action, he\\u2019s spending more time explaining to voters how policies like Medicare-for-all would work in their daily lives, as well as how he could beat Trump. (Bloomberg News)\\n\\n-- One in five women doubt that a woman can win the presidency, according to a new CNN poll. What\\u2019s telling about this news is that just 9 percent of men said the same. (Eugene Scott)\\n\\n-- Mike Bloomberg may be lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, but he\\u2019s attracted the president\\u2019s obsessive attention by baiting him with constant attack ads. Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer report: \\u201cThe president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him \\u2018Mini Mike\\u2019 to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials. \\u2018It\\u2019s very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,\\u2019 said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide \\u2026 Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. \\u2026 Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on \\u2018Fox & Friends\\u2019 on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as \\u2018dopes and babies.\\u2019 Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Former top supporters of Cory Booker accused Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s campaign of \\u201cchasing ambulances.\\u201d From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cThe phone calls to Amy Nielsen came around two hours apart. It was last Monday around 12 p.m., not long after the news broke, when her phone lit up with his name. By then, Nielsen considered Cory Booker \\u2018part of [her] family.\\u2019 \\u2026 So the end of his campaign felt \\u2026 like \\u2018a death.\\u2019 \\u2026 The next call came around 2:30 p.m., this time from an unknown number. It was Pete Buttigieg, calling to seek Nielsen\\u2019s support now that her candidate had made the decision to \\u2018step aside.\\u2019 \\u2026 \\u2018It was a gut punch \\u2014 like, really? He did not \\u2018step aside\\u2019 for you,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Like, wow, that\\u2019s some nerve right there.\\u2019 Later that night, she said, Nielsen heard from one of Booker\\u2019s field organizers who said she had already been contacted by the Buttigieg campaign to go door-knock.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Twelve years ago, Buttigieg spent the final week before the 2008 caucuses in rural southwest Iowa, trying to turn out voters for Barack Obama in one of the most conservative towns in the state. Holly Bailey spoke with him about what he learned: \\u201c\\u2018This was a new experience to really talk to people like this,\\u2019 Buttigieg recalled. \\u2018And what I found was, first of all, you can\\u2019t assume where somebody is going to be. We were in an area where a lot of people weren\\u2019t Democrats to begin with, and those who were were more likely to be for [John] Edwards. But they would hear us out when we were talking about Obama. And sometimes, as you do when you go door-to-door, somebody, because you represent a presidential campaign, would just pour out everything that was on their mind, everything they were upset about.\\\"\\n\\n\\u00ad-- Early voting means that millions are already eligible to cast their ballot. From the AP: \\u201cIn Minnesota, in-person early voting began Jan. 17. Vermont\\u2019s deadline to mail out its absentee ballots was the same day. Many of the 14 Super Tuesday states will offer some form of early voting between now and mid-February.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Howard County saw a bigger swing from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 than any other in Iowa. The Wall Street Journal's John McCormick took the pulse for 2020: \\u201cRecent interviews with dozens of voters here suggest that most of Mr. Trump\\u2019s 2016 supporters ... plan to stick with him, even though some said they have grown weary of his personal behavior and trade fights. Among those who previously voted for Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, many said they are reserving judgment until they see who wins the Democratic nomination. \\u2026 What such swing voters do in 2020 will have national implications. Before Mr. Trump, Howard County hadn\\u2019t backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. It is one of the 31 counties in Iowa\\u2014the most of any state\\u2014that backed Mr. Obama twice and then switched to Mr. Trump. The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A new Iowa caucus app is sparking election security concerns. From NBC News: \\u201cThe app will be used in Iowa and Nevada by caucus managers \\u2014 local registered Democrats who sign up to organize and run the caucus process in each location \\u2014 to expedite the process, calculate and assign delegates and report results back quickly. The app will also be used in satellite voting locations across the country and overseas. But questions about the app remain unanswered, including who developed it and whether it has been subjected to independent security testing. Security experts say that the app is a potential target for early election interference, particularly since it is downloaded on to the personal phones of the caucus managers. Party officials say operational security prevents them from disclosing specifics about the app.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Big-money groups aligned with the Senate GOP raised $68.3 million in 2019, an off-year record. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \\u201cThe majority of the money raised in 2019 came in the latter half of the year, particularly in the final two months, largely driven by the House Democrats\\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The ranks of scientists are growing thin in the Trump administration. Annie Gowen, Juliet Eilperin, Ben Guarino and Andrew Ba Tran report: \\u201cDozens of government computers sit in a nondescript building [in Kansas City, Mo.], able to connect to a data model that could help farmers manage the impact of a changing climate on their crops. But no one in this federal agency would know how to access the model, or, if they did, what to do with the data. That\\u2019s because the ambitious federal researcher who created it in Washington quit rather than move when the Agriculture Department relocated his agency to an office park here last fall. He is one of hundreds of scientists across the federal government who have been forced out, sidelined or muted since President Trump took office. \\u2026 In the first two years of the Trump administration, more than 1,600 federal scientists left government, according to Office of Personnel Management employment data \\u2026 That represents a 1.5 percent drop, compared with the 8 percent increase during the same period in the Obama administration.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Justice Department conceded that it had \\u201cinsufficient\\u201d cause to continue monitoring a former Trump campaign adviser during the Russia probe. Matt Zapotosky reports: \\u201cThe concession was revealed in an order posted on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\\u2019s website. In December, according to the order, the department told the court it had come to believe that in at least two of the four applications to monitor the former adviser, Carter Page, \\u2018there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause\\u2019 to believe he was acting as a Russian agent.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Trump administration will create additional new hurdles for pregnant foreign women seeking U.S. tourist visas. The administration said it's trying to crack down on what it calls \\u201cbirth tourism,\\\" trying to reduce what conservatives call \\\"anchor babies,\\\" by instructing consular officers to assess whether women requesting tourist visas are hoping to give birth on U.S. soil, which would effectively grant their children American citizenship. Starting today, the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor visas to women hoping to travel to the country with the stated purpose of having a child. Foggy Bottom said consular officers cannot require pregnancy tests to make the determination but wouldn\\u2019t rule out a woman\\u2019s physical appearance when making the decision, per Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti.\\n\\n-- Trump's \\\"national public health emergency\\\" declaration on the opioid crisis expired because his people at the Department of Health and Human Services forgot to renew it. An HHS spokesperson said the nine-day lapse had been corrected and blamed a clerical error. The emergency status, first announced in 2017 as a measure deemed necessary to direct more resources toward the drug overdose crisis, needs to be renewed every 90 days.

I was just trying to get him away from me, and he took my hands and put them over my head,\\u2019 Sciorra told the jury in Weinstein\\u2019s sexual assault trial, her eyes welling up with tears and her voice breaking. \\u2026 Weinstein, who had been watching her from the defense table, turned his gaze away from his accuser as she emotionally detailed the encounter. \\u2026 In her five hours of testimony, she described freezing after the attack, adding that \\u2018It was just so disgusting that my body started to shake.\\u2019 She said she had no romantic interest in Weinstein.

But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies. Adding to the stress, Friday marked the official start of \\u2026 when China celebrates the arrival of the new lunar year. Authorities around the country, including in the capital Beijing, have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the holiday to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could be spread. \\u2026The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was already entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice.

A total of 8,420 were reported to be under observation. South Korean authorities confirmed Friday that a second person tested positive for the new coronavirus. \\u2026 Japan also confirmed a second case, a man in his 40s from Wuhan who arrived in Japan on Sunday on a flight through Hong Kong. Other countries to have reported infections including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to a confirmed case in Washington state, Texas has reported a potential case of coronavirus in Brazos County, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The patient contracted a respiratory illness within two weeks of traveling in Wuhan and is being isolated at home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\\n\\n\\u201cSome details about the latest deaths in China have raised concerns about the virus\\u2019s spread. Until now, the vast majority of the people had been older than 60 and almost all of them had existing health conditions.

Erin Cunningham and Mohammad Mahdi Sultani report: \\u201cDecades ago, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted thousands of people to flee to neighboring Iran. Now, many of these refugees are once again seeking a new home in a new land, Turkey, desperate to escape the dire economic conditions fueled by U.S. sanctions on Tehran. \\u2026 Turkish authorities are grappling with nearly 4 million refugees.

From the Daily Beast: \\u201cAbdulrahman Almutairi is a 27-year-old comedian and former student at the University of San Diego with a big social-media presence. After Almutairi used social media to criticize the powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman over the October 2018 murder and dismemberment of Washington Post contributor [Jamal] Khashoggi, an unidentified Saudi man accompanied Almutairi\\u2019s father on a flight to collect Almutairi against his will and bring him back to Saudi Arabia...\\\"\\n\\n-- The Trump administration has missed the deadline, established by law, to turn over to Congress an unclassified report on Khashoggi's murder and the role played by the regime in Riyadh. From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cIn December, lawmakers passed a sweeping defense bill that included a provision ordering the director of national intelligence to send Congress an unclassified report identifying those responsible for Khashoggi\\u2019s death at a Saudi Arabian consulate in 2018. The legislation set the deadline for the report at 30 days, which passed earlier this week.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A small team of FBI agents spent years trying to solve a stubborn mystery \\u2013 whether officials from Saudi Arabia were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. A team of ProPublica and NYT Magazine reporters tell their story: \\u201cThe FBI has disputed the idea that foreign-policy considerations significantly influenced its investigation. In interviews, current and former bureau officials and federal prosecutors insisted to us that they never would have hesitated to pursue any Saudi who could have been solidly linked to the 9/11 plot \\u2026 But others who worked on the matter, including some at the FBI\\u2019s highest levels, say that the United States\\u2019 complex and often-troubled relationship with the Saudi regime was an unavoidable fact throughout their investigations. Even as the Saudi authorities became more cooperative with the United States in fighting al-Qaida after 2003, they were minimally and grudgingly helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry. According to current and former officials, requests for assistance that might rattle the Saudi security agencies were frequently balanced against FBI and CIA needs for Saudi help against continuing terror threats.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival, Benny Gantz, next week to discuss his Middle East peace plan.

Col. Alexander Vindman as the model of courage that Senate Republicans should follow during President Trump's trial.\\n\\nThe House Intelligence chairman fought back emotion late last night as he recalled Vindman\\u2019s November appearance before his committee. Vindman was born in the Soviet Union, but his father brought him here when he was a young boy. The director of European Affairs on the National Security Council, who received a Purple Heart after he was injured in Iraq, said that his father worried when he told him he would testify. But he reassured him. \\u201cThis is America,\\u201d Vindman recalled telling his dad. \\u201cHere, right matters.\\u201d The audience broke into spontaneous applause.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, right is supposed to matter,\\u201d Schiff told senators last night in the 10 p.m. hour, wrapping up day two of his case against Trump, which he will conclude Friday afternoon. \\u201cIt\\u2019s what\\u2019s made us the greatest nation on Earth. No Constitution can protect us if right doesn\\u2019t matter anymore. You know you can\\u2019t trust this president to do what\\u2019s right for this country. You can trust that he will do what\\u2019s right for Donald Trump. He\\u2019ll do it now. He\\u2019ll do it for the next several months. He\\u2019ll do it in the election if he\\u2019s allowed to. This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Democrat from California has repeatedly praised Vindman and others for \\u201csticking their necks out\\u201d to answer questions about the president\\u2019s alleged Ukraine coercion campaign when his former bosses, including ex-national security adviser John Bolton, refused to come before the House. \\u201cI have such admiration for the fact they did,\\u201d Schiff said on Wednesday. \\u201cBut what would really vindicate that leap of faith \\u2026 is if we show the same courage. They risked everything\\u2014their careers\\u2014and, yes, I know what you are asked to decide may risk yours too, but if they could show the courage, so can we.\\u201d\\n\\nOver the course of several hours earlier in the afternoon, Schiff had laid out 10 separate arguments for why Trump\\u2019s push to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden was intended for the president\\u2019s personal benefit and not to advance the national interest. \\u201cWhen we\\u2019re done, we believe that we will have made the case overwhelmingly that the president is guilty,\\u201d Schiff said. \\u201cIs there really any doubt about this? I mean, do we really have any doubt about the facts here? Does anybody really question whether the president is capable of what he\\u2019s charged with? No one is really making the argument Donald Trump would never do such a thing \\u2026 because, of course, we know that he would.\\u201d\\n\\nVindman remains assigned to the White House, something that has drawn the continuing ire of pro-Trump commentators. Schiff thanked senators last night for \\u201ckeeping an open mind about all of the issues we are presenting.\\u201d But, after Schiff spoke, Senate Republican leaders privately expressed growing confidence that they can win the vote next week to block additional witnesses from being summoned to testify. It\\u2019s not clear whether Schiff\\u2019s calls for courage have pushed any Republican senators toward breaking with the president and their party leaders on the key votes coming up next week surrounding summoning witnesses or subpoenaing documents.\\n\\n-- Schiff spoke a few hours after Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), one of the jurors, questioned Vindman\\u2019s patriotism by propagating an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory from the fever swamps of the dark corners of the pro-Trump fringe Internet. Blackburn claimed that Vindman once badmouthed the United States to Russians while serving overseas. \\u201cAdam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot,\\u201d she tweeted. \\u201cHow patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America\\u2019s greatest enemy?\\u201d\\n\\nVindman\\u2019s lawyer, former ambassador David Pressman, accused Blackburn of defaming his client. \\u201cThat a member of the Senate \\u2014 at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility \\u2014 would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice,\\u201d Pressman emailed. \\u201cWhile Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\\u201d\\n\\nBlackburn isn\\u2019t backing down and tweeted another attack around 8 p.m. Trump himself retweeted her this morning. The senator, who won Bob Corker's seat after he retired in 2018, has also accused Vindman of being a \\u201chandler\\u201d for the whistleblower who filed the complaint. Vindman testified before Schiff\\u2019s committee that he spoke with an intelligence community official about Trump\\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he declined to identify the official on the advice of counsel because he said he didn\\u2019t want to blow someone\\u2019s cover. But no public evidence exists that he was a source for the whistleblower.\\n\\n-- Schiff, a mild-mannered former federal prosecutor, has emerged as a surprisingly polarizing figure. Perhaps it\\u2019s because the president has accused him of committing treason, in addition to calling him \\u201cpencil neck\\u201d and \\u201cliddle.\\u201d Trump has now tweeted about Schiff hundreds of times. Schiff\\u2019s boosters say the right only loathes him because he\\u2019s so effective.\\n\\n-- The president\\u2019s allies at Fox News have elevated Schiff this week into perhaps the biggest boogeyman for their audience. Arguably he\\u2019s a bigger target of their vitriol right now than Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders or even the four minority women in the Squad. If you\\u2019ve watched the network for even a few minutes this week, especially in primetime, you\\u2019ve probably seen hosts and guests attacking the man from Burbank.\\n\\nTucker Carlson continued his mockery last night of the man he\\u2019s taken to calling \\u201cSaint Adam,\\u201d a nickname intended to convey what he portrays as the congressman\\u2019s sanctimoniousness. \\u201cSay what you will, but as a piece of theater, it had literally everything,\\u201d Carlson said after playing a video clip of Schiff talking on the Senate floor about how Trump\\u2019s approach to Ukraine has played into Russian President Vladimir Putin\\u2019s hands.\\n\\n\\u201cThey accused us of doing nefarious things with this Lev Parnas character,\\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told Sean Hannity. \\u201cThe truth is Adam Schiff and the Democrats have been doing nefarious things with Parnas!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAdam's ordinarily not that stupid, but when you tell the jury, the Senate, on one day that they're corrupt, and then you tell the American people they cannot be trusted to pick the commander in chief, that's just a wildly stupid trial strategy,\\u201d former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told Bret Baier.\\n\\n-- Rudy Giuliani appeared on \\u201cFox & Friends\\u201d this morning to attack the Democratic managers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a complete show on the part of the Democrats, and they should be sued for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and they should pay for that hearing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to present over the next two to three weeks shocking crimes at the highest levels of both governments while the Senate is listening to a totally phony group of stories about non-impeachable offenses.\\u201d\\n\\nGiuliani has been promising for a while now to release said evidence. It has not been forthcoming, so take such claims with more than a grain of salt. The president\\u2019s lawyer also said for months that he was going to release a lengthy report rebutting former special counsel Bob Mueller\\u2019s findings on Russian interference and whether Trump obstructed justice. He never did.\\n\\n-- Meanwhile, thought leaders on the left have effusively praised Schiff's performance. Esquire\\u2019s Charlie Pierce calls Schiff the Daniel Webster of our time. Walter Dellinger, who was acting U.S. solicitor general under Bill Clinton, said Schiff offered \\u201cone of the most impressive performances by a lawyer I have ever seen.\\u201d MSNBC legal commentator Jason Johnson called Schiff\\u2019s opening statement on Wednesday \\u201ca speech that kids will be giving in 2060 at university projects.\\u201d Actress and activist Alyssa Milano, who has been attending the trial, said \\u201cit felt like you were watching a one-man show on Broadway.\\u201d\\n\\nStephen Colbert offered an early valentine to Schiff during his show. \\u201cIt was gratifying to see someone taking the constitutional responsibility of their office seriously,\\u201d the comedian told his viewers on CBS. Breaking out of character, he said that Schiff spoke \\u201cclearly, passionately, cogently, and, I believe, courageously.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Schiff \\u201cwell spoken\\u201d and said \\u201cdid a good job of creating a tapestry.\\u201d But other Republican senators have told reporters that Schiff was overly \\u201csmooth\\u201d or \\u201cslick,\\u201d which they meant as negatives. \\u201cIn a way I do feel like I\\u2019m introducing myself to a number of the senators,\\u201d Schiff told the Associated Press, adding that they\\u2019re \\u201cfinding I\\u2019m not the demon that I\\u2019m portrayed as on Fox.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope that four Republicans still might be persuaded to vote for witnesses. \\u201cJust about every Republican\\u2019s eyes were glued on Mr. Schiff,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a powerful rendition.\\u201d\\n\\n-- All eyes are on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). \\u201cPrivately, senior Senate Republicans expect the vote to seek witness testimony to fail, but they are watching Alexander and several other Republicans closely. And wherever Alexander comes down is almost sure to be the majority position in the Senate,\\u201d Politico reports. \\u201cHe's a retiring defender of the Senate as an institution who's occasionally bucked his party, but he also counts Mitch McConnell as a longtime ally. He's more hesitant to criticize Trump than are some other Republicans, but he also has said it was \\u2018inappropriate\\u2019 for Trump to ask foreign governments to investigate his political opponents. \\u2026 [Democrats] are holding out hope that Alexander will be their hero in the mold of the late Sen. John McCain, whose extraordinary vote derailed the GOP\\u2019s effort to repeal Obamacare.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump is keeping his distance from the Republicans who might vote to call witnesses after White House advisers warned the president that outreach wouldn\\u2019t help his cause. Democrats are also giving them space. Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report: \\u201cDemocrats say there is no serious effort to privately lobby the Republicans, with the party relying instead on public opinion and the House prosecutors to squeeze them into breaking ranks.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) played with blue and purple fidget spinners. These are popular toys for children. In contrast, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who will potentially cast decisive votes on witnesses, almost never moved from their second-row desks. \\u201cCollins is a furious note taker, while Murkowski just stares intensely at the speaker,\\u201d Paul Kane reports.\\n\\n-- Collins sent a handwritten note to Roberts before his admonishment of the lawyers for both sides in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The senior senator for Maine, facing a tough reelection fight, told WCSH-TV in her state that the debate had become \\u201ctoo personal,\\u201d and she said she got mad when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Senate Republicans of being part of a coverup. \\u201cI had heard both sides impugn the integrity of one another and also cast aspersions on the Senate,\\u201d Collins said. \\u201cThat is just not appropriate.\\u201d Collins said she\\u2019s undecided on witnesses but added that the Nadler comments won\\u2019t affect her decision.\\n\\n-- Fresh polling shows most Americans overwhelmingly think witnesses should testify. An AP-NORC poll shows that 7 in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his top aides to appear before the Senate, including most Republicans. The same survey found that 45 percent think Trump should be convicted, 40 percent said he should not be and 14 percent said they don\\u2019t know enough to have an opinion.\\n\\n-- But, but, but: \\u201cMitch McConnell doesn\\u2019t care what you think,\\u201d Ben Terris writes in a new profile of the majority leader. \\u201cHe just wants to win.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A growing number of Republican senators are pointing to Trump's threat to invoke executive privilege as an excuse to vote against even trying to call witnesses, CNN reports: \\u201cGOP senators are privately and publicly raising concerns that issuing subpoenas -- to top officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton and for documents blocked by the White House -- will only serve to drag out the proceedings. Plus, many say there's little appetite for such a time-consuming fight, given that legal battles may ultimately not be successful and could force the courts to rule on hugely consequential constitutional issues about the separation of powers between the branches of government.\\u201d\\n\\nMORE FROM THE TRIAL:\\n\\n-- Democrats used a significant chunk of time on Thursday to preemptively defend the Bidens, who they expect Trump\\u2019s lawyers to attack when they get the floor: \\u201cRep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine,\\u201d Seung Min Kim, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. \\u201cBut Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump\\u2019s defense team. \\u2026 Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn\\u2019t focus on Biden\\u2019s actions toward Ukraine until 2019 \\u2026 She also referenced a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \\u2026 and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden\\u2019s desire to see [prosecutor Viktor] Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy \\u2026 As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cBefore the trial officially began Thursday afternoon, dozens of senators from both parties entered a secure facility in the Senate basement to view a classified document provided by Jennifer Williams, a national security adviser to Vice President Pence. \\u2026 The document had been previously submitted to the House Intelligence Committee. Some senators spent only a few minutes in the facility; others stayed for the better part of an hour. Several Democrats emerged to say they didn\\u2019t understand why the document had been classified. \\u2018I don\\u2019t believe it\\u2019s being withheld from the public for national security reasons. It may be withheld for political security reasons,\\u2019 said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).\\u201d\\n\\n-- The favorite talking point for most Senate Republicans continues to be that they\\u2019re learning nothing new because House managers are repeating themselves. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters during last night\\u2019s dinner break that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day in the Senate.\\u201d Ironically, he had repeated throughout the day that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day.\\u201d He said the same thing to CNN in the morning.\\n\\n\\u201cFor them to say they\\u2019re bored, it has a lot to do with them not wanting to hear evidence,\\u201d countered Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \\u201cThey don\\u2019t want to hear that this president who they\\u2019re so busy supporting did these things. As I put it, the truth hurts.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Tomorrow\\u2019s timing: Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) tells reporters that Saturday\\u2019s session will likely start and end earlier than the past few days. Party leaders are still trying to negotiate a deal to start the day as early as 8 a.m. so they can wrap up by noon. This would allow Democratic presidential candidates to fly to Iowa for campaign events. The trial has started at 1 p.m. during the week so that Chief Justice John Roberts can participate in pre-scheduled Supreme Court oral arguments before crossing the street to preside over the trial in the Capitol.\\n\\n-- Pelosi may be half a world away from the Senate floor, but that doesn\\u2019t mean the speaker doesn\\u2019t have the trial under control. From the Times: \\u201cEven in her absence from the Capitol this week, as the speaker traveled through Poland and Israel \\u2026 she had her hand firmly on the tiller. \\u2026 In many ways, Ms. Pelosi is the eighth, largely unseen manager of the Democrats\\u2019 case. \\u2026 Ms. Pelosi has dispatched her handpicked House general counsel to sit at the table inside the Senate chamber, with the prosecutors acting as her eyes and ears. She reviewed all the managers\\u2019 written briefs before they were filed.\\\"\\n\\n-- A core argument from Democrats yesterday was that the framers didn\\u2019t believe a president needed to break the law in order to warrant impeachment. \\u201cThe Constitution is not a suicide pact,\\u201d said Nadler, one of the managers. \\u201cIt does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The House\\u2019s lawyers filed a motion with an appeals court last night that says Trump\\u2019s defense lawyers have contradicted, and therefore undermined, the Department of Justice\\u2019s position on subpoenas. Ann Marimow reports: \\u201cThe lawyers for [Pelosi] asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to rule quickly on the pair of separation-of-powers cases, which they said could affect the Senate proceedings. House Democrats went to court seeking testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn and access to secret grand jury evidence from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\\u2019s Russia investigation. Justice Department attorneys have urged the appeals court to stay out of what they say are political disputes between Congress and the White House.\\u201d But the president\\u2019s team is now telling the Senate that these are matters more properly left to the courts.\\n\\n-- The White House also stonewalled the Government Accountability Office when the independent congressional watchdog requested information about the freeze on Ukraine aid. From Politico: \\u201cThe White House responded to the [GAO\\u2019s] inquiry with a one-page letter on Dec. 20, citing a legal memo from the Office of Management and Budget that defended the hold on military aid as necessary to ensure spending the funds wouldn't \\u2018conflict with the President's foreign policy.\\u2019 \\u2026 The correspondence is part of what led GAO to \\u2026 conclude last week that Trump's decision to withhold military aid violated federal law.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Follow the money: The documents turned over by Lev Parnas, Giuliani\\u2019s former associate, provide details about the web of dark money that helped fund Trump\\u2019s Ukrainian gambit. From Bloomberg News: \\u201cMoney flowed to Giuliani and his cohorts from home loans, friends, relative strangers and wealthy businessmen, some with interests in the gas and energy sector. It even came from a lawyer for an embattled Ukrainian energy tycoon fighting extradition to the U.S. on a conspiracy charge. \\u2026 The travel arrangements could brush up against campaign finance laws. While Giuliani [and Parnas] can volunteer as much of their time as they want for a campaign, any subsidy for such work by third parties would generally need to be reported as a contribution, and money from foreign individuals would be illegal.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dana Milbank: \\\"John Roberts comes face to face with the mess he made.\\\"\\n\\u2022 Ruth Marcus: \\u201cA more assertive John Roberts would be a bad idea.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Brenda Wineapple, author of a book on Andrew Johnson\\u2019s impeachment: \\u201cIf John Roberts is seeking a role model, let\\u2019s hope it\\u2019s not Salmon Chase.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Michael Gerson: \\u201cRepublicans aren\\u2019t serving the country, or even the president. Just themselves.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Eugene Robinson: \\u201cSenate Republicans\\u2019 defense of Trump is as mushy as apple pie.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Garret Graff, founding director of the Aspen Institute\\u2019s Cyber & Technology Program: \\u201cTrump won\\u2019t protect our elections, so private companies are doing it.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dan Drezner: \\u201cWhen American political institutions give up: After three years of Trump, there have been some unhealthy adjustments.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Regional radio hosts across the country have found themselves showered with attention by senior Trump officials, who have made accessibility to local conservative talking heads a central part of the president\\u2019s reelection strategy. Sarah Ellison reports: \\u201cPouring attention on regional talk-radio hosts is a classic Trumpworld move: giving relatively unknown characters proximity to the White House has paid off with a disproportionate amount of attention and praise lavished on the president and his agenda. \\u2026 The strategy has been particularly powerful as Trump and his team have engaged in what [Steve] Bannon calls \\u2018information warfare\\u2019 over the impeachment fight...\\u201d\\n\\n-- Kamala \\\"that-little-girl-was-me\\\" Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joe Biden to boost her standing in the veepstakes. From the New York Times: \\u201cSuch a move could lift Mr. Biden\\u2019s campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris\\u2019s chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California. An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial \\u2026 She and [Biden] have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Anita Hill told an Iowa crowd last night that it\\u2019s too late for Biden to apologize for the way he mistreated and diminished her when she testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991. \\u201cThe statute of limitations for his apology is up,\\u201d Hill said in response to a question from the audience at the University of Iowa, where she gave a lecture on ending sexual harassment. \\u201cWhat are you going to do about it? What are you going to do today? Will you promise as leader of this country \\u2026 to use all of your energy to address the problem as it happened and to prevent it from happening to another generation? That\\u2019s what I want to hear. And I not only want to hear from him, I want to hear from every one of them who want to be the leader of this country.\\u201d (BuzzFeed News)\\n\\n-- Bernie Sanders asked his supporters to cool it \\u2013 but they don\\u2019t always listen. Sean Sullivan reports: \\u201cCampaign officials have been pressing surrogates and other allies not to escalate combustible disputes that have recently become more personal, ... including a tense fight with Joe Biden, a separate altercation with [Elizabeth Warren] and a renewed schism with Hillary Clinton. \\u2026 But many Sanders supporters, and even some campaign aides, are inclined to take a more aggressive approach that they say will highlight important differences. \\u2026 Some close Sanders allies acknowledged the difficulty of balancing the passions of his loyal backers, inspired by his calls for a political revolution and his staunchly liberal platform, with the need to demonstrate a broader unity.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sanders\\u2019s rise in the polls means he\\u2019ll be talking more about his electability than a revolution. While speeches he\\u2019s made over the past two weeks still feature his signature call to action, he\\u2019s spending more time explaining to voters how policies like Medicare-for-all would work in their daily lives, as well as how he could beat Trump. (Bloomberg News)\\n\\n-- One in five women doubt that a woman can win the presidency, according to a new CNN poll. What\\u2019s telling about this news is that just 9 percent of men said the same. (Eugene Scott)\\n\\n-- Mike Bloomberg may be lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, but he\\u2019s attracted the president\\u2019s obsessive attention by baiting him with constant attack ads. Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer report: \\u201cThe president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him \\u2018Mini Mike\\u2019 to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials. \\u2018It\\u2019s very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,\\u2019 said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide \\u2026 Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. \\u2026 Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on \\u2018Fox & Friends\\u2019 on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as \\u2018dopes and babies.\\u2019 Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Former top supporters of Cory Booker accused Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s campaign of \\u201cchasing ambulances.\\u201d From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cThe phone calls to Amy Nielsen came around two hours apart. It was last Monday around 12 p.m., not long after the news broke, when her phone lit up with his name. By then, Nielsen considered Cory Booker \\u2018part of [her] family.\\u2019 \\u2026 So the end of his campaign felt \\u2026 like \\u2018a death.\\u2019 \\u2026 The next call came around 2:30 p.m., this time from an unknown number. It was Pete Buttigieg, calling to seek Nielsen\\u2019s support now that her candidate had made the decision to \\u2018step aside.\\u2019 \\u2026 \\u2018It was a gut punch \\u2014 like, really? He did not \\u2018step aside\\u2019 for you,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Like, wow, that\\u2019s some nerve right there.\\u2019 Later that night, she said, Nielsen heard from one of Booker\\u2019s field organizers who said she had already been contacted by the Buttigieg campaign to go door-knock.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Twelve years ago, Buttigieg spent the final week before the 2008 caucuses in rural southwest Iowa, trying to turn out voters for Barack Obama in one of the most conservative towns in the state. Holly Bailey spoke with him about what he learned: \\u201c\\u2018This was a new experience to really talk to people like this,\\u2019 Buttigieg recalled. \\u2018And what I found was, first of all, you can\\u2019t assume where somebody is going to be. We were in an area where a lot of people weren\\u2019t Democrats to begin with, and those who were were more likely to be for [John] Edwards. But they would hear us out when we were talking about Obama. And sometimes, as you do when you go door-to-door, somebody, because you represent a presidential campaign, would just pour out everything that was on their mind, everything they were upset about.\\\"\\n\\n\\u00ad-- Early voting means that millions are already eligible to cast their ballot. From the AP: \\u201cIn Minnesota, in-person early voting began Jan. 17. Vermont\\u2019s deadline to mail out its absentee ballots was the same day. Many of the 14 Super Tuesday states will offer some form of early voting between now and mid-February.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Howard County saw a bigger swing from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 than any other in Iowa. The Wall Street Journal's John McCormick took the pulse for 2020: \\u201cRecent interviews with dozens of voters here suggest that most of Mr. Trump\\u2019s 2016 supporters ... plan to stick with him, even though some said they have grown weary of his personal behavior and trade fights. Among those who previously voted for Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, many said they are reserving judgment until they see who wins the Democratic nomination. \\u2026 What such swing voters do in 2020 will have national implications. Before Mr. Trump, Howard County hadn\\u2019t backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. It is one of the 31 counties in Iowa\\u2014the most of any state\\u2014that backed Mr. Obama twice and then switched to Mr. Trump. The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A new Iowa caucus app is sparking election security concerns. From NBC News: \\u201cThe app will be used in Iowa and Nevada by caucus managers \\u2014 local registered Democrats who sign up to organize and run the caucus process in each location \\u2014 to expedite the process, calculate and assign delegates and report results back quickly. The app will also be used in satellite voting locations across the country and overseas. But questions about the app remain unanswered, including who developed it and whether it has been subjected to independent security testing. Security experts say that the app is a potential target for early election interference, particularly since it is downloaded on to the personal phones of the caucus managers. Party officials say operational security prevents them from disclosing specifics about the app.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Big-money groups aligned with the Senate GOP raised $68.3 million in 2019, an off-year record. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \\u201cThe majority of the money raised in 2019 came in the latter half of the year, particularly in the final two months, largely driven by the House Democrats\\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The ranks of scientists are growing thin in the Trump administration. Annie Gowen, Juliet Eilperin, Ben Guarino and Andrew Ba Tran report: \\u201cDozens of government computers sit in a nondescript building [in Kansas City, Mo.], able to connect to a data model that could help farmers manage the impact of a changing climate on their crops. But no one in this federal agency would know how to access the model, or, if they did, what to do with the data. That\\u2019s because the ambitious federal researcher who created it in Washington quit rather than move when the Agriculture Department relocated his agency to an office park here last fall. He is one of hundreds of scientists across the federal government who have been forced out, sidelined or muted since President Trump took office. \\u2026 In the first two years of the Trump administration, more than 1,600 federal scientists left government, according to Office of Personnel Management employment data \\u2026 That represents a 1.5 percent drop, compared with the 8 percent increase during the same period in the Obama administration.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Justice Department conceded that it had \\u201cinsufficient\\u201d cause to continue monitoring a former Trump campaign adviser during the Russia probe. Matt Zapotosky reports: \\u201cThe concession was revealed in an order posted on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\\u2019s website. In December, according to the order, the department told the court it had come to believe that in at least two of the four applications to monitor the former adviser, Carter Page, \\u2018there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause\\u2019 to believe he was acting as a Russian agent.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Trump administration will create additional new hurdles for pregnant foreign women seeking U.S. tourist visas. The administration said it's trying to crack down on what it calls \\u201cbirth tourism,\\\" trying to reduce what conservatives call \\\"anchor babies,\\\" by instructing consular officers to assess whether women requesting tourist visas are hoping to give birth on U.S. soil, which would effectively grant their children American citizenship. Starting today, the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor visas to women hoping to travel to the country with the stated purpose of having a child. Foggy Bottom said consular officers cannot require pregnancy tests to make the determination but wouldn\\u2019t rule out a woman\\u2019s physical appearance when making the decision, per Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti.\\n\\n-- Trump's \\\"national public health emergency\\\" declaration on the opioid crisis expired because his people at the Department of Health and Human Services forgot to renew it. An HHS spokesperson said the nine-day lapse had been corrected and blamed a clerical error. The emergency status, first announced in 2017 as a measure deemed necessary to direct more resources toward the drug overdose crisis, needs to be renewed every 90 days. (Politico)\\n\\n-- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, 17, needs to study economics before offering her thoughts on climate change. Heather Long reports from Davos: \\u201cThunberg and Mnuchin are both attending the World Economic Forum this week. \\u2026 At a news conference on Thursday, Mnuchin was asked for his reaction to Thunberg\\u2019s insistence on fossil fuel divestment. \\u2018Who is she?\\u2019 he tried to joke to reporters before taking a jab at Thunberg, suggesting she didn\\u2019t understand what she was talking about. \\u2026 \\u2018Is she the chief economist or who is she?

Shayna Jacobs reports: \\u201c\\u2018I was punching him. I was kicking him. I was just trying to get him away from me, and he took my hands and put them over my head,\\u2019 Sciorra told the jury in Weinstein\\u2019s sexual assault trial, her eyes welling up with tears and her voice breaking. \\u2026 Weinstein, who had been watching her from the defense table, turned his gaze away from his accuser as she emotionally detailed the encounter. \\u2026 In her five hours of testimony, she described freezing after the attack, adding that \\u2018It was just so disgusting that my body started to shake.\\u2019 She said she had no romantic interest in Weinstein. The film producer arrived at her Manhattan apartment uninvited one night.\\u201d\\n\\n-- \\u201cA young, healthy man from Wuhan and a person living 1,500 miles from the epicenter of the coronavirus are among the latest victims of the outbreak, which has incited fear and anger across China as the important Spring Festival gets underway,\\u201d Anna Fifield reports from Beijing. \\u201cReports of eight new deaths from the pneumonia-like virus, taking the total to 26, came as authorities enforced a lockdown across large parts of the province of Hubei, population 59 million. But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies. Adding to the stress, Friday marked the official start of \\u2026 when China celebrates the arrival of the new lunar year. Authorities around the country, including in the capital Beijing, have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the holiday to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could be spread. \\u2026The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was already entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice. Production companies have postponed the release of seven blockbuster films that were to be released over the holiday, leading Chinese cinema companies to close the country\\u2019s 70,000 movie theaters. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cThe National Health Commission reported Friday that there are now more than 830 confirmed cases of infection, and reports of new cases continued to roll in from around the country: from Xinjiang in the west to Shandong in the east, from Inner Mongolia in the north to Hainan in the south. A total of 8,420 were reported to be under observation. South Korean authorities confirmed Friday that a second person tested positive for the new coronavirus. \\u2026 Japan also confirmed a second case, a man in his 40s from Wuhan who arrived in Japan on Sunday on a flight through Hong Kong. Other countries to have reported infections including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to a confirmed case in Washington state, Texas has reported a potential case of coronavirus in Brazos County, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The patient contracted a respiratory illness within two weeks of traveling in Wuhan and is being isolated at home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\\n\\n\\u201cSome details about the latest deaths in China have raised concerns about the virus\\u2019s spread. Until now, the vast majority of the people had been older than 60 and almost all of them had existing health conditions. All of them had been in Hubei province \\u2026 But the latest announcement said that 36-year-old man from Wuhan, identified only by his family name, Li, died on Thursday. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions, and had been treated with anti-virus medication and antibiotics since being admitted to a hospital on Jan. 9.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Wall Street stumbled yesterday amid fears that efforts to curtail the virus could further disrupt the global economy. (David Lynch)\\n\\n-- The U.S. has officially refused to extradite Anne Sacoolas, the diplomat\\u2019s wife who fled the U.K. to avoid facing charges for killing a British teen by driving on the wrong side of the road. A State Department spokesman said extraditing Sacoolas would \\u201cset an extraordinarily troubling precedent\\u201d but did not elaborate. (Meagan Flynn)\\n\\n-- Trump\\u2019s sanctions on Iran are fueling a new refugee crisis \\u2013 in Turkey. Erin Cunningham and Mohammad Mahdi Sultani report: \\u201cDecades ago, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted thousands of people to flee to neighboring Iran. Now, many of these refugees are once again seeking a new home in a new land, Turkey, desperate to escape the dire economic conditions fueled by U.S. sanctions on Tehran. \\u2026 Turkish authorities are grappling with nearly 4 million refugees. This is the world\\u2019s largest population of displaced people, according to the United Nations, including more than 170,000 registered Afghan refugees. Turkey has struggled to contain the influx even as aid agencies say the number of arrivals from Iran is on the rise.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A critic of the Saudi Arabian government said a suspected Saudi agent tried to kidnap him on U.S. soil, a claim backed up by multiple U.S. and foreign sources familiar with the episode. From the Daily Beast: \\u201cAbdulrahman Almutairi is a 27-year-old comedian and former student at the University of San Diego with a big social-media presence. After Almutairi used social media to criticize the powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman over the October 2018 murder and dismemberment of Washington Post contributor [Jamal] Khashoggi, an unidentified Saudi man accompanied Almutairi\\u2019s father on a flight to collect Almutairi against his will and bring him back to Saudi Arabia...\\\"\\n\\n-- The Trump administration has missed the deadline, established by law, to turn over to Congress an unclassified report on Khashoggi's murder and the role played by the regime in Riyadh. From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cIn December, lawmakers passed a sweeping defense bill that included a provision ordering the director of national intelligence to send Congress an unclassified report identifying those responsible for Khashoggi\\u2019s death at a Saudi Arabian consulate in 2018. The legislation set the deadline for the report at 30 days, which passed earlier this week.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A small team of FBI agents spent years trying to solve a stubborn mystery \\u2013 whether officials from Saudi Arabia were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. A team of ProPublica and NYT Magazine reporters tell their story: \\u201cThe FBI has disputed the idea that foreign-policy considerations significantly influenced its investigation. In interviews, current and former bureau officials and federal prosecutors insisted to us that they never would have hesitated to pursue any Saudi who could have been solidly linked to the 9/11 plot \\u2026 But others who worked on the matter, including some at the FBI\\u2019s highest levels, say that the United States\\u2019 complex and often-troubled relationship with the Saudi regime was an unavoidable fact throughout their investigations. Even as the Saudi authorities became more cooperative with the United States in fighting al-Qaida after 2003, they were minimally and grudgingly helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry. According to current and former officials, requests for assistance that might rattle the Saudi security agencies were frequently balanced against FBI and CIA needs for Saudi help against continuing terror threats.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival, Benny Gantz, next week to discuss his Middle East peace plan. The meeting comes amid Trump\\u2019s trial, as well as Netanyahu and Gantz\\u2019s own troubles at home, where they\\u2019ve both failed to form a government.

Col. Alexander Vindman as the model of courage that Senate Republicans should follow during President Trump's trial.\\n\\nThe House Intelligence chairman fought back emotion late last night as he recalled Vindman\\u2019s November appearance before his committee. Vindman was born in the Soviet Union, but his father brought him here when he was a young boy. The director of European Affairs on the National Security Council, who received a Purple Heart after he was injured in Iraq, said that his father worried when he told him he would testify. But he reassured him. \\u201cThis is America,\\u201d Vindman recalled telling his dad. \\u201cHere, right matters.\\u201d The audience broke into spontaneous applause.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, right is supposed to matter,\\u201d Schiff told senators last night in the 10 p.m. hour, wrapping up day two of his case against Trump, which he will conclude Friday afternoon. \\u201cIt\\u2019s what\\u2019s made us the greatest nation on Earth. No Constitution can protect us if right doesn\\u2019t matter anymore. You know you can\\u2019t trust this president to do what\\u2019s right for this country. You can trust that he will do what\\u2019s right for Donald Trump. He\\u2019ll do it now. He\\u2019ll do it for the next several months. He\\u2019ll do it in the election if he\\u2019s allowed to. This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Democrat from California has repeatedly praised Vindman and others for \\u201csticking their necks out\\u201d to answer questions about the president\\u2019s alleged Ukraine coercion campaign when his former bosses, including ex-national security adviser John Bolton, refused to come before the House. \\u201cI have such admiration for the fact they did,\\u201d Schiff said on Wednesday. \\u201cBut what would really vindicate that leap of faith \\u2026 is if we show the same courage. They risked everything\\u2014their careers\\u2014and, yes, I know what you are asked to decide may risk yours too, but if they could show the courage, so can we.\\u201d\\n\\nOver the course of several hours earlier in the afternoon, Schiff had laid out 10 separate arguments for why Trump\\u2019s push to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden was intended for the president\\u2019s personal benefit and not to advance the national interest. \\u201cWhen we\\u2019re done, we believe that we will have made the case overwhelmingly that the president is guilty,\\u201d Schiff said. \\u201cIs there really any doubt about this? I mean, do we really have any doubt about the facts here? Does anybody really question whether the president is capable of what he\\u2019s charged with? No one is really making the argument Donald Trump would never do such a thing \\u2026 because, of course, we know that he would.\\u201d\\n\\nVindman remains assigned to the White House, something that has drawn the continuing ire of pro-Trump commentators. Schiff thanked senators last night for \\u201ckeeping an open mind about all of the issues we are presenting.\\u201d But, after Schiff spoke, Senate Republican leaders privately expressed growing confidence that they can win the vote next week to block additional witnesses from being summoned to testify. It\\u2019s not clear whether Schiff\\u2019s calls for courage have pushed any Republican senators toward breaking with the president and their party leaders on the key votes coming up next week surrounding summoning witnesses or subpoenaing documents.\\n\\n-- Schiff spoke a few hours after Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), one of the jurors, questioned Vindman\\u2019s patriotism by propagating an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory from the fever swamps of the dark corners of the pro-Trump fringe Internet. Blackburn claimed that Vindman once badmouthed the United States to Russians while serving overseas. \\u201cAdam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot,\\u201d she tweeted. \\u201cHow patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America\\u2019s greatest enemy?\\u201d\\n\\nVindman\\u2019s lawyer, former ambassador David Pressman, accused Blackburn of defaming his client. \\u201cThat a member of the Senate \\u2014 at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility \\u2014 would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice,\\u201d Pressman emailed. \\u201cWhile Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\\u201d\\n\\nBlackburn isn\\u2019t backing down and tweeted another attack around 8 p.m. Trump himself retweeted her this morning. The senator, who won Bob Corker's seat after he retired in 2018, has also accused Vindman of being a \\u201chandler\\u201d for the whistleblower who filed the complaint. Vindman testified before Schiff\\u2019s committee that he spoke with an intelligence community official about Trump\\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he declined to identify the official on the advice of counsel because he said he didn\\u2019t want to blow someone\\u2019s cover. But no public evidence exists that he was a source for the whistleblower.\\n\\n-- Schiff, a mild-mannered former federal prosecutor, has emerged as a surprisingly polarizing figure. Perhaps it\\u2019s because the president has accused him of committing treason, in addition to calling him \\u201cpencil neck\\u201d and \\u201cliddle.\\u201d Trump has now tweeted about Schiff hundreds of times. Schiff\\u2019s boosters say the right only loathes him because he\\u2019s so effective.\\n\\n-- The president\\u2019s allies at Fox News have elevated Schiff this week into perhaps the biggest boogeyman for their audience. Arguably he\\u2019s a bigger target of their vitriol right now than Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders or even the four minority women in the Squad. If you\\u2019ve watched the network for even a few minutes this week, especially in primetime, you\\u2019ve probably seen hosts and guests attacking the man from Burbank.\\n\\nTucker Carlson continued his mockery last night of the man he\\u2019s taken to calling \\u201cSaint Adam,\\u201d a nickname intended to convey what he portrays as the congressman\\u2019s sanctimoniousness. \\u201cSay what you will, but as a piece of theater, it had literally everything,\\u201d Carlson said after playing a video clip of Schiff talking on the Senate floor about how Trump\\u2019s approach to Ukraine has played into Russian President Vladimir Putin\\u2019s hands.\\n\\n\\u201cThey accused us of doing nefarious things with this Lev Parnas character,\\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told Sean Hannity. \\u201cThe truth is Adam Schiff and the Democrats have been doing nefarious things with Parnas!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAdam's ordinarily not that stupid, but when you tell the jury, the Senate, on one day that they're corrupt, and then you tell the American people they cannot be trusted to pick the commander in chief, that's just a wildly stupid trial strategy,\\u201d former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told Bret Baier.\\n\\n-- Rudy Giuliani appeared on \\u201cFox & Friends\\u201d this morning to attack the Democratic managers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a complete show on the part of the Democrats, and they should be sued for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and they should pay for that hearing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to present over the next two to three weeks shocking crimes at the highest levels of both governments while the Senate is listening to a totally phony group of stories about non-impeachable offenses.\\u201d\\n\\nGiuliani has been promising for a while now to release said evidence. It has not been forthcoming, so take such claims with more than a grain of salt. The president\\u2019s lawyer also said for months that he was going to release a lengthy report rebutting former special counsel Bob Mueller\\u2019s findings on Russian interference and whether Trump obstructed justice. He never did.\\n\\n-- Meanwhile, thought leaders on the left have effusively praised Schiff's performance. Esquire\\u2019s Charlie Pierce calls Schiff the Daniel Webster of our time. Walter Dellinger, who was acting U.S. solicitor general under Bill Clinton, said Schiff offered \\u201cone of the most impressive performances by a lawyer I have ever seen.\\u201d MSNBC legal commentator Jason Johnson called Schiff\\u2019s opening statement on Wednesday \\u201ca speech that kids will be giving in 2060 at university projects.\\u201d Actress and activist Alyssa Milano, who has been attending the trial, said \\u201cit felt like you were watching a one-man show on Broadway.\\u201d\\n\\nStephen Colbert offered an early valentine to Schiff during his show. \\u201cIt was gratifying to see someone taking the constitutional responsibility of their office seriously,\\u201d the comedian told his viewers on CBS. Breaking out of character, he said that Schiff spoke \\u201cclearly, passionately, cogently, and, I believe, courageously.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Schiff \\u201cwell spoken\\u201d and said \\u201cdid a good job of creating a tapestry.\\u201d But other Republican senators have told reporters that Schiff was overly \\u201csmooth\\u201d or \\u201cslick,\\u201d which they meant as negatives. \\u201cIn a way I do feel like I\\u2019m introducing myself to a number of the senators,\\u201d Schiff told the Associated Press, adding that they\\u2019re \\u201cfinding I\\u2019m not the demon that I\\u2019m portrayed as on Fox.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope that four Republicans still might be persuaded to vote for witnesses. \\u201cJust about every Republican\\u2019s eyes were glued on Mr. Schiff,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a powerful rendition.\\u201d\\n\\n-- All eyes are on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). \\u201cPrivately, senior Senate Republicans expect the vote to seek witness testimony to fail, but they are watching Alexander and several other Republicans closely. And wherever Alexander comes down is almost sure to be the majority position in the Senate,\\u201d Politico reports. \\u201cHe's a retiring defender of the Senate as an institution who's occasionally bucked his party, but he also counts Mitch McConnell as a longtime ally. He's more hesitant to criticize Trump than are some other Republicans, but he also has said it was \\u2018inappropriate\\u2019 for Trump to ask foreign governments to investigate his political opponents. \\u2026 [Democrats] are holding out hope that Alexander will be their hero in the mold of the late Sen. John McCain, whose extraordinary vote derailed the GOP\\u2019s effort to repeal Obamacare.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump is keeping his distance from the Republicans who might vote to call witnesses after White House advisers warned the president that outreach wouldn\\u2019t help his cause. Democrats are also giving them space. Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report: \\u201cDemocrats say there is no serious effort to privately lobby the Republicans, with the party relying instead on public opinion and the House prosecutors to squeeze them into breaking ranks.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) played with blue and purple fidget spinners. These are popular toys for children. In contrast, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who will potentially cast decisive votes on witnesses, almost never moved from their second-row desks. \\u201cCollins is a furious note taker, while Murkowski just stares intensely at the speaker,\\u201d Paul Kane reports.\\n\\n-- Collins sent a handwritten note to Roberts before his admonishment of the lawyers for both sides in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The senior senator for Maine, facing a tough reelection fight, told WCSH-TV in her state that the debate had become \\u201ctoo personal,\\u201d and she said she got mad when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Senate Republicans of being part of a coverup. \\u201cI had heard both sides impugn the integrity of one another and also cast aspersions on the Senate,\\u201d Collins said. \\u201cThat is just not appropriate.\\u201d Collins said she\\u2019s undecided on witnesses but added that the Nadler comments won\\u2019t affect her decision.\\n\\n-- Fresh polling shows most Americans overwhelmingly think witnesses should testify. An AP-NORC poll shows that 7 in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his top aides to appear before the Senate, including most Republicans. The same survey found that 45 percent think Trump should be convicted, 40 percent said he should not be and 14 percent said they don\\u2019t know enough to have an opinion.\\n\\n-- But, but, but: \\u201cMitch McConnell doesn\\u2019t care what you think,\\u201d Ben Terris writes in a new profile of the majority leader. \\u201cHe just wants to win.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A growing number of Republican senators are pointing to Trump's threat to invoke executive privilege as an excuse to vote against even trying to call witnesses, CNN reports: \\u201cGOP senators are privately and publicly raising concerns that issuing subpoenas -- to top officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton and for documents blocked by the White House -- will only serve to drag out the proceedings. Plus, many say there's little appetite for such a time-consuming fight, given that legal battles may ultimately not be successful and could force the courts to rule on hugely consequential constitutional issues about the separation of powers between the branches of government.\\u201d\\n\\nMORE FROM THE TRIAL:\\n\\n-- Democrats used a significant chunk of time on Thursday to preemptively defend the Bidens, who they expect Trump\\u2019s lawyers to attack when they get the floor: \\u201cRep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine,\\u201d Seung Min Kim, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. \\u201cBut Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump\\u2019s defense team. \\u2026 Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn\\u2019t focus on Biden\\u2019s actions toward Ukraine until 2019 \\u2026 She also referenced a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \\u2026 and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden\\u2019s desire to see [prosecutor Viktor] Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy \\u2026 As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cBefore the trial officially began Thursday afternoon, dozens of senators from both parties entered a secure facility in the Senate basement to view a classified document provided by Jennifer Williams, a national security adviser to Vice President Pence. \\u2026 The document had been previously submitted to the House Intelligence Committee. Some senators spent only a few minutes in the facility; others stayed for the better part of an hour. Several Democrats emerged to say they didn\\u2019t understand why the document had been classified. \\u2018I don\\u2019t believe it\\u2019s being withheld from the public for national security reasons. It may be withheld for political security reasons,\\u2019 said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).\\u201d\\n\\n-- The favorite talking point for most Senate Republicans continues to be that they\\u2019re learning nothing new because House managers are repeating themselves. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters during last night\\u2019s dinner break that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day in the Senate.\\u201d Ironically, he had repeated throughout the day that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day.\\u201d He said the same thing to CNN in the morning.\\n\\n\\u201cFor them to say they\\u2019re bored, it has a lot to do with them not wanting to hear evidence,\\u201d countered Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \\u201cThey don\\u2019t want to hear that this president who they\\u2019re so busy supporting did these things. As I put it, the truth hurts.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Tomorrow\\u2019s timing: Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) tells reporters that Saturday\\u2019s session will likely start and end earlier than the past few days. Party leaders are still trying to negotiate a deal to start the day as early as 8 a.m. so they can wrap up by noon. This would allow Democratic presidential candidates to fly to Iowa for campaign events. The trial has started at 1 p.m. during the week so that Chief Justice John Roberts can participate in pre-scheduled Supreme Court oral arguments before crossing the street to preside over the trial in the Capitol.\\n\\n-- Pelosi may be half a world away from the Senate floor, but that doesn\\u2019t mean the speaker doesn\\u2019t have the trial under control. From the Times: \\u201cEven in her absence from the Capitol this week, as the speaker traveled through Poland and Israel \\u2026 she had her hand firmly on the tiller. \\u2026 In many ways, Ms. Pelosi is the eighth, largely unseen manager of the Democrats\\u2019 case. \\u2026 Ms. Pelosi has dispatched her handpicked House general counsel to sit at the table inside the Senate chamber, with the prosecutors acting as her eyes and ears. She reviewed all the managers\\u2019 written briefs before they were filed.\\\"\\n\\n-- A core argument from Democrats yesterday was that the framers didn\\u2019t believe a president needed to break the law in order to warrant impeachment. \\u201cThe Constitution is not a suicide pact,\\u201d said Nadler, one of the managers. \\u201cIt does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The House\\u2019s lawyers filed a motion with an appeals court last night that says Trump\\u2019s defense lawyers have contradicted, and therefore undermined, the Department of Justice\\u2019s position on subpoenas. Ann Marimow reports: \\u201cThe lawyers for [Pelosi] asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to rule quickly on the pair of separation-of-powers cases, which they said could affect the Senate proceedings. House Democrats went to court seeking testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn and access to secret grand jury evidence from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\\u2019s Russia investigation. Justice Department attorneys have urged the appeals court to stay out of what they say are political disputes between Congress and the White House.\\u201d But the president\\u2019s team is now telling the Senate that these are matters more properly left to the courts.\\n\\n-- The White House also stonewalled the Government Accountability Office when the independent congressional watchdog requested information about the freeze on Ukraine aid. From Politico: \\u201cThe White House responded to the [GAO\\u2019s] inquiry with a one-page letter on Dec. 20, citing a legal memo from the Office of Management and Budget that defended the hold on military aid as necessary to ensure spending the funds wouldn't \\u2018conflict with the President's foreign policy.\\u2019 \\u2026 The correspondence is part of what led GAO to \\u2026 conclude last week that Trump's decision to withhold military aid violated federal law.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Follow the money: The documents turned over by Lev Parnas, Giuliani\\u2019s former associate, provide details about the web of dark money that helped fund Trump\\u2019s Ukrainian gambit. From Bloomberg News: \\u201cMoney flowed to Giuliani and his cohorts from home loans, friends, relative strangers and wealthy businessmen, some with interests in the gas and energy sector. It even came from a lawyer for an embattled Ukrainian energy tycoon fighting extradition to the U.S. on a conspiracy charge. \\u2026 The travel arrangements could brush up against campaign finance laws. While Giuliani [and Parnas] can volunteer as much of their time as they want for a campaign, any subsidy for such work by third parties would generally need to be reported as a contribution, and money from foreign individuals would be illegal.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dana Milbank: \\\"John Roberts comes face to face with the mess he made.\\\"\\n\\u2022 Ruth Marcus: \\u201cA more assertive John Roberts would be a bad idea.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Brenda Wineapple, author of a book on Andrew Johnson\\u2019s impeachment: \\u201cIf John Roberts is seeking a role model, let\\u2019s hope it\\u2019s not Salmon Chase.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Michael Gerson: \\u201cRepublicans aren\\u2019t serving the country, or even the president.

Sarah Ellison reports: \\u201cPouring attention on regional talk-radio hosts is a classic Trumpworld move: giving relatively unknown characters proximity to the White House has paid off with a disproportionate amount of attention and praise lavished on the president and his agenda. \\u2026 The strategy has been particularly powerful as Trump and his team have engaged in what [Steve] Bannon calls \\u2018information warfare\\u2019 over the impeachment fight...\\u201d\\n\\n-- Kamala \\\"that-little-girl-was-me\\\" Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joe Biden to boost her standing in the veepstakes. From the New York Times: \\u201cSuch a move could lift Mr. Biden\\u2019s campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris\\u2019s chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California. An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial \\u2026 She and [Biden] have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Anita Hill told an Iowa crowd last night that it\\u2019s too late for Biden to apologize for the way he mistreated and diminished her when she testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991. \\u201cThe statute of limitations for his apology is up,\\u201d Hill said in response to a question from the audience at the University of Iowa, where she gave a lecture on ending sexual harassment. \\u201cWhat are you going to do about it? What are you going to do today? Will you promise as leader of this country \\u2026 to use all of your energy to address the problem as it happened and to prevent it from happening to another generation? That\\u2019s what I want to hear. And I not only want to hear from him, I want to hear from every one of them who want to be the leader of this country.\\u201d (BuzzFeed News)\\n\\n-- Bernie Sanders asked his supporters to cool it \\u2013 but they don\\u2019t always listen. Sean Sullivan reports: \\u201cCampaign officials have been pressing surrogates and other allies not to escalate combustible disputes that have recently become more personal, ... including a tense fight with Joe Biden, a separate altercation with [Elizabeth Warren] and a renewed schism with Hillary Clinton. \\u2026 But many Sanders supporters, and even some campaign aides, are inclined to take a more aggressive approach that they say will highlight important differences. \\u2026 Some close Sanders allies acknowledged the difficulty of balancing the passions of his loyal backers, inspired by his calls for a political revolution and his staunchly liberal platform, with the need to demonstrate a broader unity.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sanders\\u2019s rise in the polls means he\\u2019ll be talking more about his electability than a revolution. While speeches he\\u2019s made over the past two weeks still feature his signature call to action, he\\u2019s spending more time explaining to voters how policies like Medicare-for-all would work in their daily lives, as well as how he could beat Trump. (Bloomberg News)\\n\\n-- One in five women doubt that a woman can win the presidency, according to a new CNN poll. What\\u2019s telling about this news is that just 9 percent of men said the same. (Eugene Scott)\\n\\n-- Mike Bloomberg may be lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, but he\\u2019s attracted the president\\u2019s obsessive attention by baiting him with constant attack ads. Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer report: \\u201cThe president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him \\u2018Mini Mike\\u2019 to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials. \\u2018It\\u2019s very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,\\u2019 said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide \\u2026 Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. \\u2026 Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on \\u2018Fox & Friends\\u2019 on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as \\u2018dopes and babies.\\u2019 Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Former top supporters of Cory Booker accused Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s campaign of \\u201cchasing ambulances.\\u201d From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cThe phone calls to Amy Nielsen came around two hours apart. It was last Monday around 12 p.m., not long after the news broke, when her phone lit up with his name. By then, Nielsen considered Cory Booker \\u2018part of [her] family.\\u2019 \\u2026 So the end of his campaign felt \\u2026 like \\u2018a death.\\u2019 \\u2026 The next call came around 2:30 p.m., this time from an unknown number. It was Pete Buttigieg, calling to seek Nielsen\\u2019s support now that her candidate had made the decision to \\u2018step aside.\\u2019 \\u2026 \\u2018It was a gut punch \\u2014 like, really? He did not \\u2018step aside\\u2019 for you,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Like, wow, that\\u2019s some nerve right there.\\u2019 Later that night, she said, Nielsen heard from one of Booker\\u2019s field organizers who said she had already been contacted by the Buttigieg campaign to go door-knock.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Twelve years ago, Buttigieg spent the final week before the 2008 caucuses in rural southwest Iowa, trying to turn out voters for Barack Obama in one of the most conservative towns in the state. Holly Bailey spoke with him about what he learned: \\u201c\\u2018This was a new experience to really talk to people like this,\\u2019 Buttigieg recalled. \\u2018And what I found was, first of all, you can\\u2019t assume where somebody is going to be. We were in an area where a lot of people weren\\u2019t Democrats to begin with, and those who were were more likely to be for [John] Edwards. But they would hear us out when we were talking about Obama. And sometimes, as you do when you go door-to-door, somebody, because you represent a presidential campaign, would just pour out everything that was on their mind, everything they were upset about.\\\"\\n\\n\\u00ad-- Early voting means that millions are already eligible to cast their ballot. From the AP: \\u201cIn Minnesota, in-person early voting began Jan. 17. Vermont\\u2019s deadline to mail out its absentee ballots was the same day. Many of the 14 Super Tuesday states will offer some form of early voting between now and mid-February.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Howard County saw a bigger swing from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 than any other in Iowa. The Wall Street Journal's John McCormick took the pulse for 2020: \\u201cRecent interviews with dozens of voters here suggest that most of Mr. Trump\\u2019s 2016 supporters ... plan to stick with him, even though some said they have grown weary of his personal behavior and trade fights. Among those who previously voted for Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, many said they are reserving judgment until they see who wins the Democratic nomination. \\u2026 What such swing voters do in 2020 will have national implications. Before Mr. Trump, Howard County hadn\\u2019t backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. It is one of the 31 counties in Iowa\\u2014the most of any state\\u2014that backed Mr. Obama twice and then switched to Mr. Trump. The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A new Iowa caucus app is sparking election security concerns. From NBC News: \\u201cThe app will be used in Iowa and Nevada by caucus managers \\u2014 local registered Democrats who sign up to organize and run the caucus process in each location \\u2014 to expedite the process, calculate and assign delegates and report results back quickly. The app will also be used in satellite voting locations across the country and overseas. But questions about the app remain unanswered, including who developed it and whether it has been subjected to independent security testing. Security experts say that the app is a potential target for early election interference, particularly since it is downloaded on to the personal phones of the caucus managers. Party officials say operational security prevents them from disclosing specifics about the app.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Big-money groups aligned with the Senate GOP raised $68.3 million in 2019, an off-year record. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \\u201cThe majority of the money raised in 2019 came in the latter half of the year, particularly in the final two months, largely driven by the House Democrats\\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The ranks of scientists are growing thin in the Trump administration. Annie Gowen, Juliet Eilperin, Ben Guarino and Andrew Ba Tran report: \\u201cDozens of government computers sit in a nondescript building [in Kansas City, Mo.], able to connect to a data model that could help farmers manage the impact of a changing climate on their crops. But no one in this federal agency would know how to access the model, or, if they did, what to do with the data. That\\u2019s because the ambitious federal researcher who created it in Washington quit rather than move when the Agriculture Department relocated his agency to an office park here last fall. He is one of hundreds of scientists across the federal government who have been forced out, sidelined or muted since President Trump took office. \\u2026 In the first two years of the Trump administration, more than 1,600 federal scientists left government, according to Office of Personnel Management employment data \\u2026 That represents a 1.5 percent drop, compared with the 8 percent increase during the same period in the Obama administration.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Justice Department conceded that it had \\u201cinsufficient\\u201d cause to continue monitoring a former Trump campaign adviser during the Russia probe. Matt Zapotosky reports: \\u201cThe concession was revealed in an order posted on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\\u2019s website. In December, according to the order, the department told the court it had come to believe that in at least two of the four applications to monitor the former adviser, Carter Page, \\u2018there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause\\u2019 to believe he was acting as a Russian agent.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Trump administration will create additional new hurdles for pregnant foreign women seeking U.S. tourist visas. The administration said it's trying to crack down on what it calls \\u201cbirth tourism,\\\" trying to reduce what conservatives call \\\"anchor babies,\\\" by instructing consular officers to assess whether women requesting tourist visas are hoping to give birth on U.S. soil, which would effectively grant their children American citizenship. Starting today, the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor visas to women hoping to travel to the country with the stated purpose of having a child. Foggy Bottom said consular officers cannot require pregnancy tests to make the determination but wouldn\\u2019t rule out a woman\\u2019s physical appearance when making the decision, per Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti.\\n\\n-- Trump's \\\"national public health emergency\\\" declaration on the opioid crisis expired because his people at the Department of Health and Human Services forgot to renew it. An HHS spokesperson said the nine-day lapse had been corrected and blamed a clerical error. The emergency status, first announced in 2017 as a measure deemed necessary to direct more resources toward the drug overdose crisis, needs to be renewed every 90 days.

Heather Long reports from Davos: \\u201cThunberg and Mnuchin are both attending the World Economic Forum this week. \\u2026 At a news conference on Thursday, Mnuchin was asked for his reaction to Thunberg\\u2019s insistence on fossil fuel divestment. \\u2018Who is she?\\u2019 he tried to joke to reporters before taking a jab at Thunberg, suggesting she didn\\u2019t understand what she was talking about. \\u2026 \\u2018Is she the chief economist or who is she?

I was just trying to get him away from me, and he took my hands and put them over my head,\\u2019 Sciorra told the jury in Weinstein\\u2019s sexual assault trial, her eyes welling up with tears and her voice breaking. \\u2026 Weinstein, who had been watching her from the defense table, turned his gaze away from his accuser as she emotionally detailed the encounter. \\u2026 In her five hours of testimony, she described freezing after the attack, adding that \\u2018It was just so disgusting that my body started to shake.\\u2019 She said she had no romantic interest in Weinstein.

But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies. Adding to the stress, Friday marked the official start of \\u2026 when China celebrates the arrival of the new lunar year. Authorities around the country, including in the capital Beijing, have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the holiday to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could be spread. \\u2026The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was already entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice.

A total of 8,420 were reported to be under observation. South Korean authorities confirmed Friday that a second person tested positive for the new coronavirus. \\u2026 Japan also confirmed a second case, a man in his 40s from Wuhan who arrived in Japan on Sunday on a flight through Hong Kong. Other countries to have reported infections including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to a confirmed case in Washington state, Texas has reported a potential case of coronavirus in Brazos County, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The patient contracted a respiratory illness within two weeks of traveling in Wuhan and is being isolated at home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\\n\\n\\u201cSome details about the latest deaths in China have raised concerns about the virus\\u2019s spread. Until now, the vast majority of the people had been older than 60 and almost all of them had existing health conditions. All of them had been in Hubei province \\u2026 But the latest announcement said that 36-year-old man from Wuhan, identified only by his family name, Li, died on Thursday. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions, and had been treated with anti-virus medication and antibiotics since being admitted to a hospital on Jan. 9.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Wall Street stumbled yesterday amid fears that efforts to curtail the virus could further disrupt the global economy.

(Meagan Flynn)\\n\\n-- Trump\\u2019s sanctions on Iran are fueling a new refugee crisis \\u2013 in Turkey. Erin Cunningham and Mohammad Mahdi Sultani report: \\u201cDecades ago, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted thousands of people to flee to neighboring Iran. Now, many of these refugees are once again seeking a new home in a new land, Turkey, desperate to escape the dire economic conditions fueled by U.S. sanctions on Tehran. \\u2026 Turkish authorities are grappling with nearly 4 million refugees. This is the world\\u2019s largest population of displaced people, according to the United Nations, including more than 170,000 registered Afghan refugees. Turkey has struggled to contain the influx even as aid agencies say the number of arrivals from Iran is on the rise.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A critic of the Saudi Arabian government said a suspected Saudi agent tried to kidnap him on U.S. soil, a claim backed up by multiple U.S. and foreign sources familiar with the episode. From the Daily Beast: \\u201cAbdulrahman Almutairi is a 27-year-old comedian and former student at the University of San Diego with a big social-media presence. After Almutairi used social media to criticize the powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman over the October 2018 murder and dismemberment of Washington Post contributor [Jamal] Khashoggi, an unidentified Saudi man accompanied Almutairi\\u2019s father on a flight to collect Almutairi against his will and bring him back to Saudi Arabia...\\\"\\n\\n-- The Trump administration has missed the deadline, established by law, to turn over to Congress an unclassified report on Khashoggi's murder and the role played by the regime in Riyadh. From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cIn December, lawmakers passed a sweeping defense bill that included a provision ordering the director of national intelligence to send Congress an unclassified report identifying those responsible for Khashoggi\\u2019s death at a Saudi Arabian consulate in 2018. The legislation set the deadline for the report at 30 days, which passed earlier this week.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A small team of FBI agents spent years trying to solve a stubborn mystery \\u2013 whether officials from Saudi Arabia were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. A team of ProPublica and NYT Magazine reporters tell their story: \\u201cThe FBI has disputed the idea that foreign-policy considerations significantly influenced its investigation. In interviews, current and former bureau officials and federal prosecutors insisted to us that they never would have hesitated to pursue any Saudi who could have been solidly linked to the 9/11 plot \\u2026 But others who worked on the matter, including some at the FBI\\u2019s highest levels, say that the United States\\u2019 complex and often-troubled relationship with the Saudi regime was an unavoidable fact throughout their investigations. Even as the Saudi authorities became more cooperative with the United States in fighting al-Qaida after 2003, they were minimally and grudgingly helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry. According to current and former officials, requests for assistance that might rattle the Saudi security agencies were frequently balanced against FBI and CIA needs for Saudi help against continuing terror threats.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival, Benny Gantz, next week to discuss his Middle East peace plan.

Col. Alexander Vindman as the model of courage that Senate Republicans should follow during President Trump's trial.\\n\\nThe House Intelligence chairman fought back emotion late last night as he recalled Vindman\\u2019s November appearance before his committee. Vindman was born in the Soviet Union, but his father brought him here when he was a young boy. The director of European Affairs on the National Security Council, who received a Purple Heart after he was injured in Iraq, said that his father worried when he told him he would testify. But he reassured him. \\u201cThis is America,\\u201d Vindman recalled telling his dad. \\u201cHere, right matters.\\u201d The audience broke into spontaneous applause.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, right is supposed to matter,\\u201d Schiff told senators last night in the 10 p.m. hour, wrapping up day two of his case against Trump, which he will conclude Friday afternoon. \\u201cIt\\u2019s what\\u2019s made us the greatest nation on Earth. No Constitution can protect us if right doesn\\u2019t matter anymore. You know you can\\u2019t trust this president to do what\\u2019s right for this country. You can trust that he will do what\\u2019s right for Donald Trump. He\\u2019ll do it now. He\\u2019ll do it for the next several months. He\\u2019ll do it in the election if he\\u2019s allowed to. This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Democrat from California has repeatedly praised Vindman and others for \\u201csticking their necks out\\u201d to answer questions about the president\\u2019s alleged Ukraine coercion campaign when his former bosses, including ex-national security adviser John Bolton, refused to come before the House. \\u201cI have such admiration for the fact they did,\\u201d Schiff said on Wednesday. \\u201cBut what would really vindicate that leap of faith \\u2026 is if we show the same courage. They risked everything\\u2014their careers\\u2014and, yes, I know what you are asked to decide may risk yours too, but if they could show the courage, so can we.\\u201d\\n\\nOver the course of several hours earlier in the afternoon, Schiff had laid out 10 separate arguments for why Trump\\u2019s push to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden was intended for the president\\u2019s personal benefit and not to advance the national interest. \\u201cWhen we\\u2019re done, we believe that we will have made the case overwhelmingly that the president is guilty,\\u201d Schiff said. \\u201cIs there really any doubt about this? I mean, do we really have any doubt about the facts here? Does anybody really question whether the president is capable of what he\\u2019s charged with? No one is really making the argument Donald Trump would never do such a thing \\u2026 because, of course, we know that he would.\\u201d\\n\\nVindman remains assigned to the White House, something that has drawn the continuing ire of pro-Trump commentators. Schiff thanked senators last night for \\u201ckeeping an open mind about all of the issues we are presenting.\\u201d But, after Schiff spoke, Senate Republican leaders privately expressed growing confidence that they can win the vote next week to block additional witnesses from being summoned to testify. It\\u2019s not clear whether Schiff\\u2019s calls for courage have pushed any Republican senators toward breaking with the president and their party leaders on the key votes coming up next week surrounding summoning witnesses or subpoenaing documents.\\n\\n-- Schiff spoke a few hours after Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), one of the jurors, questioned Vindman\\u2019s patriotism by propagating an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory from the fever swamps of the dark corners of the pro-Trump fringe Internet. Blackburn claimed that Vindman once badmouthed the United States to Russians while serving overseas. \\u201cAdam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot,\\u201d she tweeted. \\u201cHow patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America\\u2019s greatest enemy?\\u201d\\n\\nVindman\\u2019s lawyer, former ambassador David Pressman, accused Blackburn of defaming his client. \\u201cThat a member of the Senate \\u2014 at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility \\u2014 would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice,\\u201d Pressman emailed. \\u201cWhile Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\\u201d\\n\\nBlackburn isn\\u2019t backing down and tweeted another attack around 8 p.m. Trump himself retweeted her this morning. The senator, who won Bob Corker's seat after he retired in 2018, has also accused Vindman of being a \\u201chandler\\u201d for the whistleblower who filed the complaint. Vindman testified before Schiff\\u2019s committee that he spoke with an intelligence community official about Trump\\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he declined to identify the official on the advice of counsel because he said he didn\\u2019t want to blow someone\\u2019s cover. But no public evidence exists that he was a source for the whistleblower.\\n\\n-- Schiff, a mild-mannered former federal prosecutor, has emerged as a surprisingly polarizing figure. Perhaps it\\u2019s because the president has accused him of committing treason, in addition to calling him \\u201cpencil neck\\u201d and \\u201cliddle.\\u201d Trump has now tweeted about Schiff hundreds of times. Schiff\\u2019s boosters say the right only loathes him because he\\u2019s so effective.\\n\\n-- The president\\u2019s allies at Fox News have elevated Schiff this week into perhaps the biggest boogeyman for their audience. Arguably he\\u2019s a bigger target of their vitriol right now than Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders or even the four minority women in the Squad. If you\\u2019ve watched the network for even a few minutes this week, especially in primetime, you\\u2019ve probably seen hosts and guests attacking the man from Burbank.\\n\\nTucker Carlson continued his mockery last night of the man he\\u2019s taken to calling \\u201cSaint Adam,\\u201d a nickname intended to convey what he portrays as the congressman\\u2019s sanctimoniousness. \\u201cSay what you will, but as a piece of theater, it had literally everything,\\u201d Carlson said after playing a video clip of Schiff talking on the Senate floor about how Trump\\u2019s approach to Ukraine has played into Russian President Vladimir Putin\\u2019s hands.\\n\\n\\u201cThey accused us of doing nefarious things with this Lev Parnas character,\\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told Sean Hannity. \\u201cThe truth is Adam Schiff and the Democrats have been doing nefarious things with Parnas!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAdam's ordinarily not that stupid, but when you tell the jury, the Senate, on one day that they're corrupt, and then you tell the American people they cannot be trusted to pick the commander in chief, that's just a wildly stupid trial strategy,\\u201d former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told Bret Baier.\\n\\n-- Rudy Giuliani appeared on \\u201cFox & Friends\\u201d this morning to attack the Democratic managers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a complete show on the part of the Democrats, and they should be sued for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and they should pay for that hearing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to present over the next two to three weeks shocking crimes at the highest levels of both governments while the Senate is listening to a totally phony group of stories about non-impeachable offenses.\\u201d\\n\\nGiuliani has been promising for a while now to release said evidence. It has not been forthcoming, so take such claims with more than a grain of salt. The president\\u2019s lawyer also said for months that he was going to release a lengthy report rebutting former special counsel Bob Mueller\\u2019s findings on Russian interference and whether Trump obstructed justice. He never did.\\n\\n-- Meanwhile, thought leaders on the left have effusively praised Schiff's performance. Esquire\\u2019s Charlie Pierce calls Schiff the Daniel Webster of our time. Walter Dellinger, who was acting U.S. solicitor general under Bill Clinton, said Schiff offered \\u201cone of the most impressive performances by a lawyer I have ever seen.\\u201d MSNBC legal commentator Jason Johnson called Schiff\\u2019s opening statement on Wednesday \\u201ca speech that kids will be giving in 2060 at university projects.\\u201d Actress and activist Alyssa Milano, who has been attending the trial, said \\u201cit felt like you were watching a one-man show on Broadway.\\u201d\\n\\nStephen Colbert offered an early valentine to Schiff during his show. \\u201cIt was gratifying to see someone taking the constitutional responsibility of their office seriously,\\u201d the comedian told his viewers on CBS. Breaking out of character, he said that Schiff spoke \\u201cclearly, passionately, cogently, and, I believe, courageously.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Schiff \\u201cwell spoken\\u201d and said \\u201cdid a good job of creating a tapestry.\\u201d But other Republican senators have told reporters that Schiff was overly \\u201csmooth\\u201d or \\u201cslick,\\u201d which they meant as negatives. \\u201cIn a way I do feel like I\\u2019m introducing myself to a number of the senators,\\u201d Schiff told the Associated Press, adding that they\\u2019re \\u201cfinding I\\u2019m not the demon that I\\u2019m portrayed as on Fox.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope that four Republicans still might be persuaded to vote for witnesses. \\u201cJust about every Republican\\u2019s eyes were glued on Mr. Schiff,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a powerful rendition.\\u201d\\n\\n-- All eyes are on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). \\u201cPrivately, senior Senate Republicans expect the vote to seek witness testimony to fail, but they are watching Alexander and several other Republicans closely. And wherever Alexander comes down is almost sure to be the majority position in the Senate,\\u201d Politico reports. \\u201cHe's a retiring defender of the Senate as an institution who's occasionally bucked his party, but he also counts Mitch McConnell as a longtime ally. He's more hesitant to criticize Trump than are some other Republicans, but he also has said it was \\u2018inappropriate\\u2019 for Trump to ask foreign governments to investigate his political opponents. \\u2026 [Democrats] are holding out hope that Alexander will be their hero in the mold of the late Sen. John McCain, whose extraordinary vote derailed the GOP\\u2019s effort to repeal Obamacare.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump is keeping his distance from the Republicans who might vote to call witnesses after White House advisers warned the president that outreach wouldn\\u2019t help his cause. Democrats are also giving them space. Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report: \\u201cDemocrats say there is no serious effort to privately lobby the Republicans, with the party relying instead on public opinion and the House prosecutors to squeeze them into breaking ranks.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) played with blue and purple fidget spinners. These are popular toys for children. In contrast, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who will potentially cast decisive votes on witnesses, almost never moved from their second-row desks. \\u201cCollins is a furious note taker, while Murkowski just stares intensely at the speaker,\\u201d Paul Kane reports.\\n\\n-- Collins sent a handwritten note to Roberts before his admonishment of the lawyers for both sides in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The senior senator for Maine, facing a tough reelection fight, told WCSH-TV in her state that the debate had become \\u201ctoo personal,\\u201d and she said she got mad when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Senate Republicans of being part of a coverup. \\u201cI had heard both sides impugn the integrity of one another and also cast aspersions on the Senate,\\u201d Collins said. \\u201cThat is just not appropriate.\\u201d Collins said she\\u2019s undecided on witnesses but added that the Nadler comments won\\u2019t affect her decision.\\n\\n-- Fresh polling shows most Americans overwhelmingly think witnesses should testify. An AP-NORC poll shows that 7 in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his top aides to appear before the Senate, including most Republicans. The same survey found that 45 percent think Trump should be convicted, 40 percent said he should not be and 14 percent said they don\\u2019t know enough to have an opinion.\\n\\n-- But, but, but: \\u201cMitch McConnell doesn\\u2019t care what you think,\\u201d Ben Terris writes in a new profile of the majority leader. \\u201cHe just wants to win.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A growing number of Republican senators are pointing to Trump's threat to invoke executive privilege as an excuse to vote against even trying to call witnesses, CNN reports: \\u201cGOP senators are privately and publicly raising concerns that issuing subpoenas -- to top officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton and for documents blocked by the White House -- will only serve to drag out the proceedings. Plus, many say there's little appetite for such a time-consuming fight, given that legal battles may ultimately not be successful and could force the courts to rule on hugely consequential constitutional issues about the separation of powers between the branches of government.\\u201d\\n\\nMORE FROM THE TRIAL:\\n\\n-- Democrats used a significant chunk of time on Thursday to preemptively defend the Bidens, who they expect Trump\\u2019s lawyers to attack when they get the floor: \\u201cRep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine,\\u201d Seung Min Kim, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. \\u201cBut Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump\\u2019s defense team. \\u2026 Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn\\u2019t focus on Biden\\u2019s actions toward Ukraine until 2019 \\u2026 She also referenced a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \\u2026 and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden\\u2019s desire to see [prosecutor Viktor] Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy \\u2026 As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cBefore the trial officially began Thursday afternoon, dozens of senators from both parties entered a secure facility in the Senate basement to view a classified document provided by Jennifer Williams, a national security adviser to Vice President Pence. \\u2026 The document had been previously submitted to the House Intelligence Committee. Some senators spent only a few minutes in the facility; others stayed for the better part of an hour. Several Democrats emerged to say they didn\\u2019t understand why the document had been classified. \\u2018I don\\u2019t believe it\\u2019s being withheld from the public for national security reasons. It may be withheld for political security reasons,\\u2019 said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).\\u201d\\n\\n-- The favorite talking point for most Senate Republicans continues to be that they\\u2019re learning nothing new because House managers are repeating themselves. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters during last night\\u2019s dinner break that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day in the Senate.\\u201d Ironically, he had repeated throughout the day that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day.\\u201d He said the same thing to CNN in the morning.\\n\\n\\u201cFor them to say they\\u2019re bored, it has a lot to do with them not wanting to hear evidence,\\u201d countered Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \\u201cThey don\\u2019t want to hear that this president who they\\u2019re so busy supporting did these things. As I put it, the truth hurts.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Tomorrow\\u2019s timing: Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) tells reporters that Saturday\\u2019s session will likely start and end earlier than the past few days. Party leaders are still trying to negotiate a deal to start the day as early as 8 a.m. so they can wrap up by noon. This would allow Democratic presidential candidates to fly to Iowa for campaign events. The trial has started at 1 p.m. during the week so that Chief Justice John Roberts can participate in pre-scheduled Supreme Court oral arguments before crossing the street to preside over the trial in the Capitol.\\n\\n-- Pelosi may be half a world away from the Senate floor, but that doesn\\u2019t mean the speaker doesn\\u2019t have the trial under control. From the Times: \\u201cEven in her absence from the Capitol this week, as the speaker traveled through Poland and Israel \\u2026 she had her hand firmly on the tiller. \\u2026 In many ways, Ms. Pelosi is the eighth, largely unseen manager of the Democrats\\u2019 case. \\u2026 Ms. Pelosi has dispatched her handpicked House general counsel to sit at the table inside the Senate chamber, with the prosecutors acting as her eyes and ears. She reviewed all the managers\\u2019 written briefs before they were filed.\\\"\\n\\n-- A core argument from Democrats yesterday was that the framers didn\\u2019t believe a president needed to break the law in order to warrant impeachment. \\u201cThe Constitution is not a suicide pact,\\u201d said Nadler, one of the managers. \\u201cIt does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The House\\u2019s lawyers filed a motion with an appeals court last night that says Trump\\u2019s defense lawyers have contradicted, and therefore undermined, the Department of Justice\\u2019s position on subpoenas. Ann Marimow reports: \\u201cThe lawyers for [Pelosi] asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to rule quickly on the pair of separation-of-powers cases, which they said could affect the Senate proceedings. House Democrats went to court seeking testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn and access to secret grand jury evidence from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\\u2019s Russia investigation. Justice Department attorneys have urged the appeals court to stay out of what they say are political disputes between Congress and the White House.\\u201d But the president\\u2019s team is now telling the Senate that these are matters more properly left to the courts.\\n\\n-- The White House also stonewalled the Government Accountability Office when the independent congressional watchdog requested information about the freeze on Ukraine aid. From Politico: \\u201cThe White House responded to the [GAO\\u2019s] inquiry with a one-page letter on Dec. 20, citing a legal memo from the Office of Management and Budget that defended the hold on military aid as necessary to ensure spending the funds wouldn't \\u2018conflict with the President's foreign policy.\\u2019 \\u2026 The correspondence is part of what led GAO to \\u2026 conclude last week that Trump's decision to withhold military aid violated federal law.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Follow the money: The documents turned over by Lev Parnas, Giuliani\\u2019s former associate, provide details about the web of dark money that helped fund Trump\\u2019s Ukrainian gambit. From Bloomberg News: \\u201cMoney flowed to Giuliani and his cohorts from home loans, friends, relative strangers and wealthy businessmen, some with interests in the gas and energy sector. It even came from a lawyer for an embattled Ukrainian energy tycoon fighting extradition to the U.S. on a conspiracy charge. \\u2026 The travel arrangements could brush up against campaign finance laws. While Giuliani [and Parnas] can volunteer as much of their time as they want for a campaign, any subsidy for such work by third parties would generally need to be reported as a contribution, and money from foreign individuals would be illegal.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dana Milbank: \\\"John Roberts comes face to face with the mess he made.\\\"\\n\\u2022 Ruth Marcus: \\u201cA more assertive John Roberts would be a bad idea.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Brenda Wineapple, author of a book on Andrew Johnson\\u2019s impeachment: \\u201cIf John Roberts is seeking a role model, let\\u2019s hope it\\u2019s not Salmon Chase.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Michael Gerson: \\u201cRepublicans aren\\u2019t serving the country, or even the president.

Sarah Ellison reports: \\u201cPouring attention on regional talk-radio hosts is a classic Trumpworld move: giving relatively unknown characters proximity to the White House has paid off with a disproportionate amount of attention and praise lavished on the president and his agenda. \\u2026 The strategy has been particularly powerful as Trump and his team have engaged in what [Steve] Bannon calls \\u2018information warfare\\u2019 over the impeachment fight...\\u201d\\n\\n-- Kamala \\\"that-little-girl-was-me\\\" Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joe Biden to boost her standing in the veepstakes. From the New York Times: \\u201cSuch a move could lift Mr. Biden\\u2019s campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris\\u2019s chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California. An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial \\u2026 She and [Biden] have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Anita Hill told an Iowa crowd last night that it\\u2019s too late for Biden to apologize for the way he mistreated and diminished her when she testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991. \\u201cThe statute of limitations for his apology is up,\\u201d Hill said in response to a question from the audience at the University of Iowa, where she gave a lecture on ending sexual harassment. \\u201cWhat are you going to do about it? What are you going to do today? Will you promise as leader of this country \\u2026 to use all of your energy to address the problem as it happened and to prevent it from happening to another generation? That\\u2019s what I want to hear. And I not only want to hear from him, I want to hear from every one of them who want to be the leader of this country.\\u201d (BuzzFeed News)\\n\\n-- Bernie Sanders asked his supporters to cool it \\u2013 but they don\\u2019t always listen. Sean Sullivan reports: \\u201cCampaign officials have been pressing surrogates and other allies not to escalate combustible disputes that have recently become more personal, ... including a tense fight with Joe Biden, a separate altercation with [Elizabeth Warren] and a renewed schism with Hillary Clinton. \\u2026 But many Sanders supporters, and even some campaign aides, are inclined to take a more aggressive approach that they say will highlight important differences. \\u2026 Some close Sanders allies acknowledged the difficulty of balancing the passions of his loyal backers, inspired by his calls for a political revolution and his staunchly liberal platform, with the need to demonstrate a broader unity.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sanders\\u2019s rise in the polls means he\\u2019ll be talking more about his electability than a revolution. While speeches he\\u2019s made over the past two weeks still feature his signature call to action, he\\u2019s spending more time explaining to voters how policies like Medicare-for-all would work in their daily lives, as well as how he could beat Trump. (Bloomberg News)\\n\\n-- One in five women doubt that a woman can win the presidency, according to a new CNN poll. What\\u2019s telling about this news is that just 9 percent of men said the same. (Eugene Scott)\\n\\n-- Mike Bloomberg may be lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, but he\\u2019s attracted the president\\u2019s obsessive attention by baiting him with constant attack ads. Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer report: \\u201cThe president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him \\u2018Mini Mike\\u2019 to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials. \\u2018It\\u2019s very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,\\u2019 said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide \\u2026 Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. \\u2026 Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on \\u2018Fox & Friends\\u2019 on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as \\u2018dopes and babies.\\u2019 Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Former top supporters of Cory Booker accused Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s campaign of \\u201cchasing ambulances.\\u201d From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cThe phone calls to Amy Nielsen came around two hours apart. It was last Monday around 12 p.m., not long after the news broke, when her phone lit up with his name. By then, Nielsen considered Cory Booker \\u2018part of [her] family.\\u2019 \\u2026 So the end of his campaign felt \\u2026 like \\u2018a death.\\u2019 \\u2026 The next call came around 2:30 p.m., this time from an unknown number. It was Pete Buttigieg, calling to seek Nielsen\\u2019s support now that her candidate had made the decision to \\u2018step aside.\\u2019 \\u2026 \\u2018It was a gut punch \\u2014 like, really? He did not \\u2018step aside\\u2019 for you,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Like, wow, that\\u2019s some nerve right there.\\u2019 Later that night, she said, Nielsen heard from one of Booker\\u2019s field organizers who said she had already been contacted by the Buttigieg campaign to go door-knock.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Twelve years ago, Buttigieg spent the final week before the 2008 caucuses in rural southwest Iowa, trying to turn out voters for Barack Obama in one of the most conservative towns in the state. Holly Bailey spoke with him about what he learned: \\u201c\\u2018This was a new experience to really talk to people like this,\\u2019 Buttigieg recalled. \\u2018And what I found was, first of all, you can\\u2019t assume where somebody is going to be. We were in an area where a lot of people weren\\u2019t Democrats to begin with, and those who were were more likely to be for [John] Edwards. But they would hear us out when we were talking about Obama. And sometimes, as you do when you go door-to-door, somebody, because you represent a presidential campaign, would just pour out everything that was on their mind, everything they were upset about.\\\"\\n\\n\\u00ad-- Early voting means that millions are already eligible to cast their ballot. From the AP: \\u201cIn Minnesota, in-person early voting began Jan. 17. Vermont\\u2019s deadline to mail out its absentee ballots was the same day. Many of the 14 Super Tuesday states will offer some form of early voting between now and mid-February.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Howard County saw a bigger swing from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 than any other in Iowa. The Wall Street Journal's John McCormick took the pulse for 2020: \\u201cRecent interviews with dozens of voters here suggest that most of Mr. Trump\\u2019s 2016 supporters ... plan to stick with him, even though some said they have grown weary of his personal behavior and trade fights. Among those who previously voted for Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, many said they are reserving judgment until they see who wins the Democratic nomination. \\u2026 What such swing voters do in 2020 will have national implications. Before Mr. Trump, Howard County hadn\\u2019t backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. It is one of the 31 counties in Iowa\\u2014the most of any state\\u2014that backed Mr. Obama twice and then switched to Mr. Trump. The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A new Iowa caucus app is sparking election security concerns. From NBC News: \\u201cThe app will be used in Iowa and Nevada by caucus managers \\u2014 local registered Democrats who sign up to organize and run the caucus process in each location \\u2014 to expedite the process, calculate and assign delegates and report results back quickly. The app will also be used in satellite voting locations across the country and overseas. But questions about the app remain unanswered, including who developed it and whether it has been subjected to independent security testing. Security experts say that the app is a potential target for early election interference, particularly since it is downloaded on to the personal phones of the caucus managers. Party officials say operational security prevents them from disclosing specifics about the app.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Big-money groups aligned with the Senate GOP raised $68.3 million in 2019, an off-year record. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \\u201cThe majority of the money raised in 2019 came in the latter half of the year, particularly in the final two months, largely driven by the House Democrats\\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The ranks of scientists are growing thin in the Trump administration. Annie Gowen, Juliet Eilperin, Ben Guarino and Andrew Ba Tran report: \\u201cDozens of government computers sit in a nondescript building [in Kansas City, Mo.], able to connect to a data model that could help farmers manage the impact of a changing climate on their crops. But no one in this federal agency would know how to access the model, or, if they did, what to do with the data. That\\u2019s because the ambitious federal researcher who created it in Washington quit rather than move when the Agriculture Department relocated his agency to an office park here last fall. He is one of hundreds of scientists across the federal government who have been forced out, sidelined or muted since President Trump took office. \\u2026 In the first two years of the Trump administration, more than 1,600 federal scientists left government, according to Office of Personnel Management employment data \\u2026 That represents a 1.5 percent drop, compared with the 8 percent increase during the same period in the Obama administration.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Justice Department conceded that it had \\u201cinsufficient\\u201d cause to continue monitoring a former Trump campaign adviser during the Russia probe. Matt Zapotosky reports: \\u201cThe concession was revealed in an order posted on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\\u2019s website. In December, according to the order, the department told the court it had come to believe that in at least two of the four applications to monitor the former adviser, Carter Page, \\u2018there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause\\u2019 to believe he was acting as a Russian agent.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Trump administration will create additional new hurdles for pregnant foreign women seeking U.S. tourist visas. The administration said it's trying to crack down on what it calls \\u201cbirth tourism,\\\" trying to reduce what conservatives call \\\"anchor babies,\\\" by instructing consular officers to assess whether women requesting tourist visas are hoping to give birth on U.S. soil, which would effectively grant their children American citizenship. Starting today, the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor visas to women hoping to travel to the country with the stated purpose of having a child. Foggy Bottom said consular officers cannot require pregnancy tests to make the determination but wouldn\\u2019t rule out a woman\\u2019s physical appearance when making the decision, per Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti.\\n\\n-- Trump's \\\"national public health emergency\\\" declaration on the opioid crisis expired because his people at the Department of Health and Human Services forgot to renew it. An HHS spokesperson said the nine-day lapse had been corrected and blamed a clerical error. The emergency status, first announced in 2017 as a measure deemed necessary to direct more resources toward the drug overdose crisis, needs to be renewed every 90 days. (Politico)\\n\\n-- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, 17, needs to study economics before offering her thoughts on climate change. Heather Long reports from Davos: \\u201cThunberg and Mnuchin are both attending the World Economic Forum this week. \\u2026 At a news conference on Thursday, Mnuchin was asked for his reaction to Thunberg\\u2019s insistence on fossil fuel divestment. \\u2018Who is she?\\u2019 he tried to joke to reporters before taking a jab at Thunberg, suggesting she didn\\u2019t understand what she was talking about. \\u2026 \\u2018Is she the chief economist or who is she? I\\u2019m confused. ... After she goes and studies economics in college she can go back and explain that to us.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\n-- Actress Annabella Sciorra, who played Gloria in \\\"The Sopranos,\\\" testified that Harvey Weinstein raped her more than 25 years ago. Shayna Jacobs reports: \\u201c\\u2018I was punching him. I was kicking him. I was just trying to get him away from me, and he took my hands and put them over my head,\\u2019 Sciorra told the jury in Weinstein\\u2019s sexual assault trial, her eyes welling up with tears and her voice breaking. \\u2026 Weinstein, who had been watching her from the defense table, turned his gaze away from his accuser as she emotionally detailed the encounter. \\u2026 In her five hours of testimony, she described freezing after the attack, adding that \\u2018It was just so disgusting that my body started to shake.\\u2019 She said she had no romantic interest in Weinstein. The film producer arrived at her Manhattan apartment uninvited one night.\\u201d\\n\\n-- \\u201cA young, healthy man from Wuhan and a person living 1,500 miles from the epicenter of the coronavirus are among the latest victims of the outbreak, which has incited fear and anger across China as the important Spring Festival gets underway,\\u201d Anna Fifield reports from Beijing. \\u201cReports of eight new deaths from the pneumonia-like virus, taking the total to 26, came as authorities enforced a lockdown across large parts of the province of Hubei, population 59 million. But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies. Adding to the stress, Friday marked the official start of \\u2026 when China celebrates the arrival of the new lunar year. Authorities around the country, including in the capital Beijing, have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the holiday to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could be spread. \\u2026The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was already entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice. Production companies have postponed the release of seven blockbuster films that were to be released over the holiday, leading Chinese cinema companies to close the country\\u2019s 70,000 movie theaters. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cThe National Health Commission reported Friday that there are now more than 830 confirmed cases of infection, and reports of new cases continued to roll in from around the country: from Xinjiang in the west to Shandong in the east, from Inner Mongolia in the north to Hainan in the south. A total of 8,420 were reported to be under observation. South Korean authorities confirmed Friday that a second person tested positive for the new coronavirus. \\u2026 Japan also confirmed a second case, a man in his 40s from Wuhan who arrived in Japan on Sunday on a flight through Hong Kong. Other countries to have reported infections including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to a confirmed case in Washington state, Texas has reported a potential case of coronavirus in Brazos County, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The patient contracted a respiratory illness within two weeks of traveling in Wuhan and is being isolated at home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\\n\\n\\u201cSome details about the latest deaths in China have raised concerns about the virus\\u2019s spread. Until now, the vast majority of the people had been older than 60 and almost all of them had existing health conditions. All of them had been in Hubei province \\u2026 But the latest announcement said that 36-year-old man from Wuhan, identified only by his family name, Li, died on Thursday. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions, and had been treated with anti-virus medication and antibiotics since being admitted to a hospital on Jan. 9.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Wall Street stumbled yesterday amid fears that efforts to curtail the virus could further disrupt the global economy. (David Lynch)\\n\\n-- The U.S. has officially refused to extradite Anne Sacoolas, the diplomat\\u2019s wife who fled the U.K. to avoid facing charges for killing a British teen by driving on the wrong side of the road. A State Department spokesman said extraditing Sacoolas would \\u201cset an extraordinarily troubling precedent\\u201d but did not elaborate. (Meagan Flynn)\\n\\n-- Trump\\u2019s sanctions on Iran are fueling a new refugee crisis \\u2013 in Turkey. Erin Cunningham and Mohammad Mahdi Sultani report: \\u201cDecades ago, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted thousands of people to flee to neighboring Iran. Now, many of these refugees are once again seeking a new home in a new land, Turkey, desperate to escape the dire economic conditions fueled by U.S. sanctions on Tehran. \\u2026 Turkish authorities are grappling with nearly 4 million refugees. This is the world\\u2019s largest population of displaced people, according to the United Nations, including more than 170,000 registered Afghan refugees. Turkey has struggled to contain the influx even as aid agencies say the number of arrivals from Iran is on the rise.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A critic of the Saudi Arabian government said a suspected Saudi agent tried to kidnap him on U.S. soil, a claim backed up by multiple U.S. and foreign sources familiar with the episode. From the Daily Beast: \\u201cAbdulrahman Almutairi is a 27-year-old comedian and former student at the University of San Diego with a big social-media presence. After Almutairi used social media to criticize the powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman over the October 2018 murder and dismemberment of Washington Post contributor [Jamal] Khashoggi, an unidentified Saudi man accompanied Almutairi\\u2019s father on a flight to collect Almutairi against his will and bring him back to Saudi Arabia...\\\"\\n\\n-- The Trump administration has missed the deadline, established by law, to turn over to Congress an unclassified report on Khashoggi's murder and the role played by the regime in Riyadh. From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cIn December, lawmakers passed a sweeping defense bill that included a provision ordering the director of national intelligence to send Congress an unclassified report identifying those responsible for Khashoggi\\u2019s death at a Saudi Arabian consulate in 2018. The legislation set the deadline for the report at 30 days, which passed earlier this week.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A small team of FBI agents spent years trying to solve a stubborn mystery \\u2013 whether officials from Saudi Arabia were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. A team of ProPublica and NYT Magazine reporters tell their story: \\u201cThe FBI has disputed the idea that foreign-policy considerations significantly influenced its investigation. In interviews, current and former bureau officials and federal prosecutors insisted to us that they never would have hesitated to pursue any Saudi who could have been solidly linked to the 9/11 plot \\u2026 But others who worked on the matter, including some at the FBI\\u2019s highest levels, say that the United States\\u2019 complex and often-troubled relationship with the Saudi regime was an unavoidable fact throughout their investigations. Even as the Saudi authorities became more cooperative with the United States in fighting al-Qaida after 2003, they were minimally and grudgingly helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry. According to current and former officials, requests for assistance that might rattle the Saudi security agencies were frequently balanced against FBI and CIA needs for Saudi help against continuing terror threats.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival, Benny Gantz, next week to discuss his Middle East peace plan. The meeting comes amid Trump\\u2019s trial, as well as Netanyahu and Gantz\\u2019s own troubles at home, where they\\u2019ve both failed to form a government.

Col. Alexander Vindman as the model of courage that Senate Republicans should follow during President Trump's trial.\\n\\nThe House Intelligence chairman fought back emotion late last night as he recalled Vindman\\u2019s November appearance before his committee. Vindman was born in the Soviet Union, but his father brought him here when he was a young boy. The director of European Affairs on the National Security Council, who received a Purple Heart after he was injured in Iraq, said that his father worried when he told him he would testify. But he reassured him. \\u201cThis is America,\\u201d Vindman recalled telling his dad. \\u201cHere, right matters.\\u201d The audience broke into spontaneous applause.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, right is supposed to matter,\\u201d Schiff told senators last night in the 10 p.m. hour, wrapping up day two of his case against Trump, which he will conclude Friday afternoon. \\u201cIt\\u2019s what\\u2019s made us the greatest nation on Earth. No Constitution can protect us if right doesn\\u2019t matter anymore. You know you can\\u2019t trust this president to do what\\u2019s right for this country. You can trust that he will do what\\u2019s right for Donald Trump. He\\u2019ll do it now. He\\u2019ll do it for the next several months. He\\u2019ll do it in the election if he\\u2019s allowed to. This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Democrat from California has repeatedly praised Vindman and others for \\u201csticking their necks out\\u201d to answer questions about the president\\u2019s alleged Ukraine coercion campaign when his former bosses, including ex-national security adviser John Bolton, refused to come before the House. \\u201cI have such admiration for the fact they did,\\u201d Schiff said on Wednesday. \\u201cBut what would really vindicate that leap of faith \\u2026 is if we show the same courage. They risked everything\\u2014their careers\\u2014and, yes, I know what you are asked to decide may risk yours too, but if they could show the courage, so can we.\\u201d\\n\\nOver the course of several hours earlier in the afternoon, Schiff had laid out 10 separate arguments for why Trump\\u2019s push to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden was intended for the president\\u2019s personal benefit and not to advance the national interest. \\u201cWhen we\\u2019re done, we believe that we will have made the case overwhelmingly that the president is guilty,\\u201d Schiff said. \\u201cIs there really any doubt about this? I mean, do we really have any doubt about the facts here? Does anybody really question whether the president is capable of what he\\u2019s charged with? No one is really making the argument Donald Trump would never do such a thing \\u2026 because, of course, we know that he would.\\u201d\\n\\nVindman remains assigned to the White House, something that has drawn the continuing ire of pro-Trump commentators. Schiff thanked senators last night for \\u201ckeeping an open mind about all of the issues we are presenting.\\u201d But, after Schiff spoke, Senate Republican leaders privately expressed growing confidence that they can win the vote next week to block additional witnesses from being summoned to testify. It\\u2019s not clear whether Schiff\\u2019s calls for courage have pushed any Republican senators toward breaking with the president and their party leaders on the key votes coming up next week surrounding summoning witnesses or subpoenaing documents.\\n\\n-- Schiff spoke a few hours after Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), one of the jurors, questioned Vindman\\u2019s patriotism by propagating an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory from the fever swamps of the dark corners of the pro-Trump fringe Internet. Blackburn claimed that Vindman once badmouthed the United States to Russians while serving overseas. \\u201cAdam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot,\\u201d she tweeted. \\u201cHow patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America\\u2019s greatest enemy?\\u201d\\n\\nVindman\\u2019s lawyer, former ambassador David Pressman, accused Blackburn of defaming his client. \\u201cThat a member of the Senate \\u2014 at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility \\u2014 would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice,\\u201d Pressman emailed. \\u201cWhile Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\\u201d\\n\\nBlackburn isn\\u2019t backing down and tweeted another attack around 8 p.m. Trump himself retweeted her this morning. The senator, who won Bob Corker's seat after he retired in 2018, has also accused Vindman of being a \\u201chandler\\u201d for the whistleblower who filed the complaint. Vindman testified before Schiff\\u2019s committee that he spoke with an intelligence community official about Trump\\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he declined to identify the official on the advice of counsel because he said he didn\\u2019t want to blow someone\\u2019s cover. But no public evidence exists that he was a source for the whistleblower.\\n\\n-- Schiff, a mild-mannered former federal prosecutor, has emerged as a surprisingly polarizing figure. Perhaps it\\u2019s because the president has accused him of committing treason, in addition to calling him \\u201cpencil neck\\u201d and \\u201cliddle.\\u201d Trump has now tweeted about Schiff hundreds of times. Schiff\\u2019s boosters say the right only loathes him because he\\u2019s so effective.\\n\\n-- The president\\u2019s allies at Fox News have elevated Schiff this week into perhaps the biggest boogeyman for their audience. Arguably he\\u2019s a bigger target of their vitriol right now than Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders or even the four minority women in the Squad. If you\\u2019ve watched the network for even a few minutes this week, especially in primetime, you\\u2019ve probably seen hosts and guests attacking the man from Burbank.\\n\\nTucker Carlson continued his mockery last night of the man he\\u2019s taken to calling \\u201cSaint Adam,\\u201d a nickname intended to convey what he portrays as the congressman\\u2019s sanctimoniousness. \\u201cSay what you will, but as a piece of theater, it had literally everything,\\u201d Carlson said after playing a video clip of Schiff talking on the Senate floor about how Trump\\u2019s approach to Ukraine has played into Russian President Vladimir Putin\\u2019s hands.\\n\\n\\u201cThey accused us of doing nefarious things with this Lev Parnas character,\\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told Sean Hannity. \\u201cThe truth is Adam Schiff and the Democrats have been doing nefarious things with Parnas!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAdam's ordinarily not that stupid, but when you tell the jury, the Senate, on one day that they're corrupt, and then you tell the American people they cannot be trusted to pick the commander in chief, that's just a wildly stupid trial strategy,\\u201d former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told Bret Baier.\\n\\n-- Rudy Giuliani appeared on \\u201cFox & Friends\\u201d this morning to attack the Democratic managers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a complete show on the part of the Democrats, and they should be sued for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and they should pay for that hearing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to present over the next two to three weeks shocking crimes at the highest levels of both governments while the Senate is listening to a totally phony group of stories about non-impeachable offenses.\\u201d\\n\\nGiuliani has been promising for a while now to release said evidence. It has not been forthcoming, so take such claims with more than a grain of salt. The president\\u2019s lawyer also said for months that he was going to release a lengthy report rebutting former special counsel Bob Mueller\\u2019s findings on Russian interference and whether Trump obstructed justice. He never did.\\n\\n-- Meanwhile, thought leaders on the left have effusively praised Schiff's performance. Esquire\\u2019s Charlie Pierce calls Schiff the Daniel Webster of our time. Walter Dellinger, who was acting U.S. solicitor general under Bill Clinton, said Schiff offered \\u201cone of the most impressive performances by a lawyer I have ever seen.\\u201d MSNBC legal commentator Jason Johnson called Schiff\\u2019s opening statement on Wednesday \\u201ca speech that kids will be giving in 2060 at university projects.\\u201d Actress and activist Alyssa Milano, who has been attending the trial, said \\u201cit felt like you were watching a one-man show on Broadway.\\u201d\\n\\nStephen Colbert offered an early valentine to Schiff during his show. \\u201cIt was gratifying to see someone taking the constitutional responsibility of their office seriously,\\u201d the comedian told his viewers on CBS. Breaking out of character, he said that Schiff spoke \\u201cclearly, passionately, cogently, and, I believe, courageously.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Schiff \\u201cwell spoken\\u201d and said \\u201cdid a good job of creating a tapestry.\\u201d But other Republican senators have told reporters that Schiff was overly \\u201csmooth\\u201d or \\u201cslick,\\u201d which they meant as negatives. \\u201cIn a way I do feel like I\\u2019m introducing myself to a number of the senators,\\u201d Schiff told the Associated Press, adding that they\\u2019re \\u201cfinding I\\u2019m not the demon that I\\u2019m portrayed as on Fox.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope that four Republicans still might be persuaded to vote for witnesses. \\u201cJust about every Republican\\u2019s eyes were glued on Mr. Schiff,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a powerful rendition.\\u201d\\n\\n-- All eyes are on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). \\u201cPrivately, senior Senate Republicans expect the vote to seek witness testimony to fail, but they are watching Alexander and several other Republicans closely. And wherever Alexander comes down is almost sure to be the majority position in the Senate,\\u201d Politico reports. \\u201cHe's a retiring defender of the Senate as an institution who's occasionally bucked his party, but he also counts Mitch McConnell as a longtime ally. He's more hesitant to criticize Trump than are some other Republicans, but he also has said it was \\u2018inappropriate\\u2019 for Trump to ask foreign governments to investigate his political opponents. \\u2026 [Democrats] are holding out hope that Alexander will be their hero in the mold of the late Sen. John McCain, whose extraordinary vote derailed the GOP\\u2019s effort to repeal Obamacare.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump is keeping his distance from the Republicans who might vote to call witnesses after White House advisers warned the president that outreach wouldn\\u2019t help his cause. Democrats are also giving them space. Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report: \\u201cDemocrats say there is no serious effort to privately lobby the Republicans, with the party relying instead on public opinion and the House prosecutors to squeeze them into breaking ranks.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) played with blue and purple fidget spinners. These are popular toys for children. In contrast, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who will potentially cast decisive votes on witnesses, almost never moved from their second-row desks. \\u201cCollins is a furious note taker, while Murkowski just stares intensely at the speaker,\\u201d Paul Kane reports.\\n\\n-- Collins sent a handwritten note to Roberts before his admonishment of the lawyers for both sides in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The senior senator for Maine, facing a tough reelection fight, told WCSH-TV in her state that the debate had become \\u201ctoo personal,\\u201d and she said she got mad when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Senate Republicans of being part of a coverup. \\u201cI had heard both sides impugn the integrity of one another and also cast aspersions on the Senate,\\u201d Collins said. \\u201cThat is just not appropriate.\\u201d Collins said she\\u2019s undecided on witnesses but added that the Nadler comments won\\u2019t affect her decision.\\n\\n-- Fresh polling shows most Americans overwhelmingly think witnesses should testify. An AP-NORC poll shows that 7 in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his top aides to appear before the Senate, including most Republicans. The same survey found that 45 percent think Trump should be convicted, 40 percent said he should not be and 14 percent said they don\\u2019t know enough to have an opinion.\\n\\n-- But, but, but: \\u201cMitch McConnell doesn\\u2019t care what you think,\\u201d Ben Terris writes in a new profile of the majority leader. \\u201cHe just wants to win.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A growing number of Republican senators are pointing to Trump's threat to invoke executive privilege as an excuse to vote against even trying to call witnesses, CNN reports: \\u201cGOP senators are privately and publicly raising concerns that issuing subpoenas -- to top officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton and for documents blocked by the White House -- will only serve to drag out the proceedings. Plus, many say there's little appetite for such a time-consuming fight, given that legal battles may ultimately not be successful and could force the courts to rule on hugely consequential constitutional issues about the separation of powers between the branches of government.\\u201d\\n\\nMORE FROM THE TRIAL:\\n\\n-- Democrats used a significant chunk of time on Thursday to preemptively defend the Bidens, who they expect Trump\\u2019s lawyers to attack when they get the floor: \\u201cRep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine,\\u201d Seung Min Kim, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. \\u201cBut Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump\\u2019s defense team. \\u2026 Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn\\u2019t focus on Biden\\u2019s actions toward Ukraine until 2019 \\u2026 She also referenced a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \\u2026 and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden\\u2019s desire to see [prosecutor Viktor] Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy \\u2026 As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cBefore the trial officially began Thursday afternoon, dozens of senators from both parties entered a secure facility in the Senate basement to view a classified document provided by Jennifer Williams, a national security adviser to Vice President Pence. \\u2026 The document had been previously submitted to the House Intelligence Committee. Some senators spent only a few minutes in the facility; others stayed for the better part of an hour. Several Democrats emerged to say they didn\\u2019t understand why the document had been classified. \\u2018I don\\u2019t believe it\\u2019s being withheld from the public for national security reasons. It may be withheld for political security reasons,\\u2019 said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).\\u201d\\n\\n-- The favorite talking point for most Senate Republicans continues to be that they\\u2019re learning nothing new because House managers are repeating themselves. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters during last night\\u2019s dinner break that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day in the Senate.\\u201d Ironically, he had repeated throughout the day that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day.\\u201d He said the same thing to CNN in the morning.\\n\\n\\u201cFor them to say they\\u2019re bored, it has a lot to do with them not wanting to hear evidence,\\u201d countered Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \\u201cThey don\\u2019t want to hear that this president who they\\u2019re so busy supporting did these things. As I put it, the truth hurts.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Tomorrow\\u2019s timing: Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) tells reporters that Saturday\\u2019s session will likely start and end earlier than the past few days. Party leaders are still trying to negotiate a deal to start the day as early as 8 a.m. so they can wrap up by noon. This would allow Democratic presidential candidates to fly to Iowa for campaign events. The trial has started at 1 p.m. during the week so that Chief Justice John Roberts can participate in pre-scheduled Supreme Court oral arguments before crossing the street to preside over the trial in the Capitol.\\n\\n-- Pelosi may be half a world away from the Senate floor, but that doesn\\u2019t mean the speaker doesn\\u2019t have the trial under control. From the Times: \\u201cEven in her absence from the Capitol this week, as the speaker traveled through Poland and Israel \\u2026 she had her hand firmly on the tiller. \\u2026 In many ways, Ms. Pelosi is the eighth, largely unseen manager of the Democrats\\u2019 case. \\u2026 Ms. Pelosi has dispatched her handpicked House general counsel to sit at the table inside the Senate chamber, with the prosecutors acting as her eyes and ears. She reviewed all the managers\\u2019 written briefs before they were filed.\\\"\\n\\n-- A core argument from Democrats yesterday was that the framers didn\\u2019t believe a president needed to break the law in order to warrant impeachment. \\u201cThe Constitution is not a suicide pact,\\u201d said Nadler, one of the managers. \\u201cIt does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The House\\u2019s lawyers filed a motion with an appeals court last night that says Trump\\u2019s defense lawyers have contradicted, and therefore undermined, the Department of Justice\\u2019s position on subpoenas. Ann Marimow reports: \\u201cThe lawyers for [Pelosi] asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to rule quickly on the pair of separation-of-powers cases, which they said could affect the Senate proceedings. House Democrats went to court seeking testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn and access to secret grand jury evidence from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\\u2019s Russia investigation. Justice Department attorneys have urged the appeals court to stay out of what they say are political disputes between Congress and the White House.\\u201d But the president\\u2019s team is now telling the Senate that these are matters more properly left to the courts.\\n\\n-- The White House also stonewalled the Government Accountability Office when the independent congressional watchdog requested information about the freeze on Ukraine aid. From Politico: \\u201cThe White House responded to the [GAO\\u2019s] inquiry with a one-page letter on Dec. 20, citing a legal memo from the Office of Management and Budget that defended the hold on military aid as necessary to ensure spending the funds wouldn't \\u2018conflict with the President's foreign policy.\\u2019 \\u2026 The correspondence is part of what led GAO to \\u2026 conclude last week that Trump's decision to withhold military aid violated federal law.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Follow the money: The documents turned over by Lev Parnas, Giuliani\\u2019s former associate, provide details about the web of dark money that helped fund Trump\\u2019s Ukrainian gambit. From Bloomberg News: \\u201cMoney flowed to Giuliani and his cohorts from home loans, friends, relative strangers and wealthy businessmen, some with interests in the gas and energy sector. It even came from a lawyer for an embattled Ukrainian energy tycoon fighting extradition to the U.S. on a conspiracy charge. \\u2026 The travel arrangements could brush up against campaign finance laws. While Giuliani [and Parnas] can volunteer as much of their time as they want for a campaign, any subsidy for such work by third parties would generally need to be reported as a contribution, and money from foreign individuals would be illegal.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dana Milbank: \\\"John Roberts comes face to face with the mess he made.\\\"\\n\\u2022 Ruth Marcus: \\u201cA more assertive John Roberts would be a bad idea.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Brenda Wineapple, author of a book on Andrew Johnson\\u2019s impeachment: \\u201cIf John Roberts is seeking a role model, let\\u2019s hope it\\u2019s not Salmon Chase.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Michael Gerson: \\u201cRepublicans aren\\u2019t serving the country, or even the president. Just themselves.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Eugene Robinson: \\u201cSenate Republicans\\u2019 defense of Trump is as mushy as apple pie.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Garret Graff, founding director of the Aspen Institute\\u2019s Cyber & Technology Program: \\u201cTrump won\\u2019t protect our elections, so private companies are doing it.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dan Drezner: \\u201cWhen American political institutions give up: After three years of Trump, there have been some unhealthy adjustments.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Regional radio hosts across the country have found themselves showered with attention by senior Trump officials, who have made accessibility to local conservative talking heads a central part of the president\\u2019s reelection strategy. Sarah Ellison reports: \\u201cPouring attention on regional talk-radio hosts is a classic Trumpworld move: giving relatively unknown characters proximity to the White House has paid off with a disproportionate amount of attention and praise lavished on the president and his agenda. \\u2026 The strategy has been particularly powerful as Trump and his team have engaged in what [Steve] Bannon calls \\u2018information warfare\\u2019 over the impeachment fight...\\u201d\\n\\n-- Kamala \\\"that-little-girl-was-me\\\" Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joe Biden to boost her standing in the veepstakes. From the New York Times: \\u201cSuch a move could lift Mr. Biden\\u2019s campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris\\u2019s chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California. An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial \\u2026 She and [Biden] have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Anita Hill told an Iowa crowd last night that it\\u2019s too late for Biden to apologize for the way he mistreated and diminished her when she testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991. \\u201cThe statute of limitations for his apology is up,\\u201d Hill said in response to a question from the audience at the University of Iowa, where she gave a lecture on ending sexual harassment. \\u201cWhat are you going to do about it? What are you going to do today? Will you promise as leader of this country \\u2026 to use all of your energy to address the problem as it happened and to prevent it from happening to another generation? That\\u2019s what I want to hear. And I not only want to hear from him, I want to hear from every one of them who want to be the leader of this country.\\u201d (BuzzFeed News)\\n\\n-- Bernie Sanders asked his supporters to cool it \\u2013 but they don\\u2019t always listen. Sean Sullivan reports: \\u201cCampaign officials have been pressing surrogates and other allies not to escalate combustible disputes that have recently become more personal, ... including a tense fight with Joe Biden, a separate altercation with [Elizabeth Warren] and a renewed schism with Hillary Clinton. \\u2026 But many Sanders supporters, and even some campaign aides, are inclined to take a more aggressive approach that they say will highlight important differences. \\u2026 Some close Sanders allies acknowledged the difficulty of balancing the passions of his loyal backers, inspired by his calls for a political revolution and his staunchly liberal platform, with the need to demonstrate a broader unity.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sanders\\u2019s rise in the polls means he\\u2019ll be talking more about his electability than a revolution. While speeches he\\u2019s made over the past two weeks still feature his signature call to action, he\\u2019s spending more time explaining to voters how policies like Medicare-for-all would work in their daily lives, as well as how he could beat Trump. (Bloomberg News)\\n\\n-- One in five women doubt that a woman can win the presidency, according to a new CNN poll. What\\u2019s telling about this news is that just 9 percent of men said the same. (Eugene Scott)\\n\\n-- Mike Bloomberg may be lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, but he\\u2019s attracted the president\\u2019s obsessive attention by baiting him with constant attack ads. Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer report: \\u201cThe president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him \\u2018Mini Mike\\u2019 to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials. \\u2018It\\u2019s very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,\\u2019 said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide \\u2026 Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. \\u2026 Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on \\u2018Fox & Friends\\u2019 on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as \\u2018dopes and babies.\\u2019 Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Former top supporters of Cory Booker accused Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s campaign of \\u201cchasing ambulances.\\u201d From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cThe phone calls to Amy Nielsen came around two hours apart. It was last Monday around 12 p.m., not long after the news broke, when her phone lit up with his name. By then, Nielsen considered Cory Booker \\u2018part of [her] family.\\u2019 \\u2026 So the end of his campaign felt \\u2026 like \\u2018a death.\\u2019 \\u2026 The next call came around 2:30 p.m., this time from an unknown number. It was Pete Buttigieg, calling to seek Nielsen\\u2019s support now that her candidate had made the decision to \\u2018step aside.\\u2019 \\u2026 \\u2018It was a gut punch \\u2014 like, really? He did not \\u2018step aside\\u2019 for you,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Like, wow, that\\u2019s some nerve right there.\\u2019 Later that night, she said, Nielsen heard from one of Booker\\u2019s field organizers who said she had already been contacted by the Buttigieg campaign to go door-knock.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Twelve years ago, Buttigieg spent the final week before the 2008 caucuses in rural southwest Iowa, trying to turn out voters for Barack Obama in one of the most conservative towns in the state. Holly Bailey spoke with him about what he learned: \\u201c\\u2018This was a new experience to really talk to people like this,\\u2019 Buttigieg recalled. \\u2018And what I found was, first of all, you can\\u2019t assume where somebody is going to be. We were in an area where a lot of people weren\\u2019t Democrats to begin with, and those who were were more likely to be for [John] Edwards. But they would hear us out when we were talking about Obama. And sometimes, as you do when you go door-to-door, somebody, because you represent a presidential campaign, would just pour out everything that was on their mind, everything they were upset about.\\\"\\n\\n\\u00ad-- Early voting means that millions are already eligible to cast their ballot. From the AP: \\u201cIn Minnesota, in-person early voting began Jan. 17. Vermont\\u2019s deadline to mail out its absentee ballots was the same day. Many of the 14 Super Tuesday states will offer some form of early voting between now and mid-February.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Howard County saw a bigger swing from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 than any other in Iowa. The Wall Street Journal's John McCormick took the pulse for 2020: \\u201cRecent interviews with dozens of voters here suggest that most of Mr. Trump\\u2019s 2016 supporters ... plan to stick with him, even though some said they have grown weary of his personal behavior and trade fights. Among those who previously voted for Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, many said they are reserving judgment until they see who wins the Democratic nomination. \\u2026 What such swing voters do in 2020 will have national implications. Before Mr. Trump, Howard County hadn\\u2019t backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. It is one of the 31 counties in Iowa\\u2014the most of any state\\u2014that backed Mr. Obama twice and then switched to Mr. Trump. The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A new Iowa caucus app is sparking election security concerns. From NBC News: \\u201cThe app will be used in Iowa and Nevada by caucus managers \\u2014 local registered Democrats who sign up to organize and run the caucus process in each location \\u2014 to expedite the process, calculate and assign delegates and report results back quickly. The app will also be used in satellite voting locations across the country and overseas. But questions about the app remain unanswered, including who developed it and whether it has been subjected to independent security testing. Security experts say that the app is a potential target for early election interference, particularly since it is downloaded on to the personal phones of the caucus managers. Party officials say operational security prevents them from disclosing specifics about the app.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Big-money groups aligned with the Senate GOP raised $68.3 million in 2019, an off-year record. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \\u201cThe majority of the money raised in 2019 came in the latter half of the year, particularly in the final two months, largely driven by the House Democrats\\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The ranks of scientists are growing thin in the Trump administration. Annie Gowen, Juliet Eilperin, Ben Guarino and Andrew Ba Tran report: \\u201cDozens of government computers sit in a nondescript building [in Kansas City, Mo.], able to connect to a data model that could help farmers manage the impact of a changing climate on their crops. But no one in this federal agency would know how to access the model, or, if they did, what to do with the data. That\\u2019s because the ambitious federal researcher who created it in Washington quit rather than move when the Agriculture Department relocated his agency to an office park here last fall. He is one of hundreds of scientists across the federal government who have been forced out, sidelined or muted since President Trump took office. \\u2026 In the first two years of the Trump administration, more than 1,600 federal scientists left government, according to Office of Personnel Management employment data \\u2026 That represents a 1.5 percent drop, compared with the 8 percent increase during the same period in the Obama administration.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Justice Department conceded that it had \\u201cinsufficient\\u201d cause to continue monitoring a former Trump campaign adviser during the Russia probe. Matt Zapotosky reports: \\u201cThe concession was revealed in an order posted on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\\u2019s website. In December, according to the order, the department told the court it had come to believe that in at least two of the four applications to monitor the former adviser, Carter Page, \\u2018there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause\\u2019 to believe he was acting as a Russian agent.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Trump administration will create additional new hurdles for pregnant foreign women seeking U.S. tourist visas. The administration said it's trying to crack down on what it calls \\u201cbirth tourism,\\\" trying to reduce what conservatives call \\\"anchor babies,\\\" by instructing consular officers to assess whether women requesting tourist visas are hoping to give birth on U.S. soil, which would effectively grant their children American citizenship. Starting today, the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor visas to women hoping to travel to the country with the stated purpose of having a child. Foggy Bottom said consular officers cannot require pregnancy tests to make the determination but wouldn\\u2019t rule out a woman\\u2019s physical appearance when making the decision, per Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti.\\n\\n-- Trump's \\\"national public health emergency\\\" declaration on the opioid crisis expired because his people at the Department of Health and Human Services forgot to renew it. An HHS spokesperson said the nine-day lapse had been corrected and blamed a clerical error. The emergency status, first announced in 2017 as a measure deemed necessary to direct more resources toward the drug overdose crisis, needs to be renewed every 90 days. (Politico)\\n\\n-- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, 17, needs to study economics before offering her thoughts on climate change. Heather Long reports from Davos: \\u201cThunberg and Mnuchin are both attending the World Economic Forum this week. \\u2026 At a news conference on Thursday, Mnuchin was asked for his reaction to Thunberg\\u2019s insistence on fossil fuel divestment. \\u2018Who is she?\\u2019 he tried to joke to reporters before taking a jab at Thunberg, suggesting she didn\\u2019t understand what she was talking about. \\u2026 \\u2018Is she the chief economist or who is she? I\\u2019m confused. ... After she goes and studies economics in college she can go back and explain that to us.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\n-- Actress Annabella Sciorra, who played Gloria in \\\"The Sopranos,\\\" testified that Harvey Weinstein raped her more than 25 years ago. Shayna Jacobs reports: \\u201c\\u2018I was punching him. I was kicking him. I was just trying to get him away from me, and he took my hands and put them over my head,\\u2019 Sciorra told the jury in Weinstein\\u2019s sexual assault trial, her eyes welling up with tears and her voice breaking. \\u2026 Weinstein, who had been watching her from the defense table, turned his gaze away from his accuser as she emotionally detailed the encounter. \\u2026 In her five hours of testimony, she described freezing after the attack, adding that \\u2018It was just so disgusting that my body started to shake.\\u2019 She said she had no romantic interest in Weinstein. The film producer arrived at her Manhattan apartment uninvited one night.\\u201d\\n\\n-- \\u201cA young, healthy man from Wuhan and a person living 1,500 miles from the epicenter of the coronavirus are among the latest victims of the outbreak, which has incited fear and anger across China as the important Spring Festival gets underway,\\u201d Anna Fifield reports from Beijing. \\u201cReports of eight new deaths from the pneumonia-like virus, taking the total to 26, came as authorities enforced a lockdown across large parts of the province of Hubei, population 59 million. But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies. Adding to the stress, Friday marked the official start of \\u2026 when China celebrates the arrival of the new lunar year. Authorities around the country, including in the capital Beijing, have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the holiday to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could be spread. \\u2026The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was already entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice. Production companies have postponed the release of seven blockbuster films that were to be released over the holiday, leading Chinese cinema companies to close the country\\u2019s 70,000 movie theaters. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cThe National Health Commission reported Friday that there are now more than 830 confirmed cases of infection, and reports of new cases continued to roll in from around the country: from Xinjiang in the west to Shandong in the east, from Inner Mongolia in the north to Hainan in the south. A total of 8,420 were reported to be under observation. South Korean authorities confirmed Friday that a second person tested positive for the new coronavirus. \\u2026 Japan also confirmed a second case, a man in his 40s from Wuhan who arrived in Japan on Sunday on a flight through Hong Kong. Other countries to have reported infections including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to a confirmed case in Washington state, Texas has reported a potential case of coronavirus in Brazos County, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The patient contracted a respiratory illness within two weeks of traveling in Wuhan and is being isolated at home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\\n\\n\\u201cSome details about the latest deaths in China have raised concerns about the virus\\u2019s spread. Until now, the vast majority of the people had been older than 60 and almost all of them had existing health conditions. All of them had been in Hubei province \\u2026 But the latest announcement said that 36-year-old man from Wuhan, identified only by his family name, Li, died on Thursday. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions, and had been treated with anti-virus medication and antibiotics since being admitted to a hospital on Jan. 9.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Wall Street stumbled yesterday amid fears that efforts to curtail the virus could further disrupt the global economy. (David Lynch)\\n\\n-- The U.S. has officially refused to extradite Anne Sacoolas, the diplomat\\u2019s wife who fled the U.K. to avoid facing charges for killing a British teen by driving on the wrong side of the road. A State Department spokesman said extraditing Sacoolas would \\u201cset an extraordinarily troubling precedent\\u201d but did not elaborate. (Meagan Flynn)\\n\\n-- Trump\\u2019s sanctions on Iran are fueling a new refugee crisis \\u2013 in Turkey. Erin Cunningham and Mohammad Mahdi Sultani report: \\u201cDecades ago, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted thousands of people to flee to neighboring Iran. Now, many of these refugees are once again seeking a new home in a new land, Turkey, desperate to escape the dire economic conditions fueled by U.S. sanctions on Tehran. \\u2026 Turkish authorities are grappling with nearly 4 million refugees. This is the world\\u2019s largest population of displaced people, according to the United Nations, including more than 170,000 registered Afghan refugees. Turkey has struggled to contain the influx even as aid agencies say the number of arrivals from Iran is on the rise.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A critic of the Saudi Arabian government said a suspected Saudi agent tried to kidnap him on U.S. soil, a claim backed up by multiple U.S. and foreign sources familiar with the episode. From the Daily Beast: \\u201cAbdulrahman Almutairi is a 27-year-old comedian and former student at the University of San Diego with a big social-media presence. After Almutairi used social media to criticize the powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman over the October 2018 murder and dismemberment of Washington Post contributor [Jamal] Khashoggi, an unidentified Saudi man accompanied Almutairi\\u2019s father on a flight to collect Almutairi against his will and bring him back to Saudi Arabia...\\\"\\n\\n-- The Trump administration has missed the deadline, established by law, to turn over to Congress an unclassified report on Khashoggi's murder and the role played by the regime in Riyadh. From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cIn December, lawmakers passed a sweeping defense bill that included a provision ordering the director of national intelligence to send Congress an unclassified report identifying those responsible for Khashoggi\\u2019s death at a Saudi Arabian consulate in 2018. The legislation set the deadline for the report at 30 days, which passed earlier this week.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A small team of FBI agents spent years trying to solve a stubborn mystery \\u2013 whether officials from Saudi Arabia were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. A team of ProPublica and NYT Magazine reporters tell their story: \\u201cThe FBI has disputed the idea that foreign-policy considerations significantly influenced its investigation. In interviews, current and former bureau officials and federal prosecutors insisted to us that they never would have hesitated to pursue any Saudi who could have been solidly linked to the 9/11 plot \\u2026 But others who worked on the matter, including some at the FBI\\u2019s highest levels, say that the United States\\u2019 complex and often-troubled relationship with the Saudi regime was an unavoidable fact throughout their investigations. Even as the Saudi authorities became more cooperative with the United States in fighting al-Qaida after 2003, they were minimally and grudgingly helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry. According to current and former officials, requests for assistance that might rattle the Saudi security agencies were frequently balanced against FBI and CIA needs for Saudi help against continuing terror threats.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival, Benny Gantz, next week to discuss his Middle East peace plan. The meeting comes amid Trump\\u2019s trial, as well as Netanyahu and Gantz\\u2019s own troubles at home, where they\\u2019ve both failed to form a government.

Col. Alexander Vindman as the model of courage that Senate Republicans should follow during President Trump's trial.\\n\\nThe House Intelligence chairman fought back emotion late last night as he recalled Vindman\\u2019s November appearance before his committee. Vindman was born in the Soviet Union, but his father brought him here when he was a young boy. The director of European Affairs on the National Security Council, who received a Purple Heart after he was injured in Iraq, said that his father worried when he told him he would testify. But he reassured him. \\u201cThis is America,\\u201d Vindman recalled telling his dad. \\u201cHere, right matters.\\u201d The audience broke into spontaneous applause.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, right is supposed to matter,\\u201d Schiff told senators last night in the 10 p.m. hour, wrapping up day two of his case against Trump, which he will conclude Friday afternoon. \\u201cIt\\u2019s what\\u2019s made us the greatest nation on Earth. No Constitution can protect us if right doesn\\u2019t matter anymore. You know you can\\u2019t trust this president to do what\\u2019s right for this country. You can trust that he will do what\\u2019s right for Donald Trump. He\\u2019ll do it now. He\\u2019ll do it for the next several months. He\\u2019ll do it in the election if he\\u2019s allowed to. This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Democrat from California has repeatedly praised Vindman and others for \\u201csticking their necks out\\u201d to answer questions about the president\\u2019s alleged Ukraine coercion campaign when his former bosses, including ex-national security adviser John Bolton, refused to come before the House. \\u201cI have such admiration for the fact they did,\\u201d Schiff said on Wednesday. \\u201cBut what would really vindicate that leap of faith \\u2026 is if we show the same courage. They risked everything\\u2014their careers\\u2014and, yes, I know what you are asked to decide may risk yours too, but if they could show the courage, so can we.\\u201d\\n\\nOver the course of several hours earlier in the afternoon, Schiff had laid out 10 separate arguments for why Trump\\u2019s push to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden was intended for the president\\u2019s personal benefit and not to advance the national interest. \\u201cWhen we\\u2019re done, we believe that we will have made the case overwhelmingly that the president is guilty,\\u201d Schiff said. \\u201cIs there really any doubt about this? I mean, do we really have any doubt about the facts here? Does anybody really question whether the president is capable of what he\\u2019s charged with? No one is really making the argument Donald Trump would never do such a thing \\u2026 because, of course, we know that he would.\\u201d\\n\\nVindman remains assigned to the White House, something that has drawn the continuing ire of pro-Trump commentators. Schiff thanked senators last night for \\u201ckeeping an open mind about all of the issues we are presenting.\\u201d But, after Schiff spoke, Senate Republican leaders privately expressed growing confidence that they can win the vote next week to block additional witnesses from being summoned to testify. It\\u2019s not clear whether Schiff\\u2019s calls for courage have pushed any Republican senators toward breaking with the president and their party leaders on the key votes coming up next week surrounding summoning witnesses or subpoenaing documents.\\n\\n-- Schiff spoke a few hours after Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), one of the jurors, questioned Vindman\\u2019s patriotism by propagating an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory from the fever swamps of the dark corners of the pro-Trump fringe Internet. Blackburn claimed that Vindman once badmouthed the United States to Russians while serving overseas. \\u201cAdam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot,\\u201d she tweeted. \\u201cHow patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America\\u2019s greatest enemy?\\u201d\\n\\nVindman\\u2019s lawyer, former ambassador David Pressman, accused Blackburn of defaming his client. \\u201cThat a member of the Senate \\u2014 at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility \\u2014 would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice,\\u201d Pressman emailed. \\u201cWhile Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\\u201d\\n\\nBlackburn isn\\u2019t backing down and tweeted another attack around 8 p.m. Trump himself retweeted her this morning. The senator, who won Bob Corker's seat after he retired in 2018, has also accused Vindman of being a \\u201chandler\\u201d for the whistleblower who filed the complaint. Vindman testified before Schiff\\u2019s committee that he spoke with an intelligence community official about Trump\\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he declined to identify the official on the advice of counsel because he said he didn\\u2019t want to blow someone\\u2019s cover. But no public evidence exists that he was a source for the whistleblower.\\n\\n-- Schiff, a mild-mannered former federal prosecutor, has emerged as a surprisingly polarizing figure. Perhaps it\\u2019s because the president has accused him of committing treason, in addition to calling him \\u201cpencil neck\\u201d and \\u201cliddle.\\u201d Trump has now tweeted about Schiff hundreds of times. Schiff\\u2019s boosters say the right only loathes him because he\\u2019s so effective.\\n\\n-- The president\\u2019s allies at Fox News have elevated Schiff this week into perhaps the biggest boogeyman for their audience. Arguably he\\u2019s a bigger target of their vitriol right now than Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders or even the four minority women in the Squad. If you\\u2019ve watched the network for even a few minutes this week, especially in primetime, you\\u2019ve probably seen hosts and guests attacking the man from Burbank.\\n\\nTucker Carlson continued his mockery last night of the man he\\u2019s taken to calling \\u201cSaint Adam,\\u201d a nickname intended to convey what he portrays as the congressman\\u2019s sanctimoniousness. \\u201cSay what you will, but as a piece of theater, it had literally everything,\\u201d Carlson said after playing a video clip of Schiff talking on the Senate floor about how Trump\\u2019s approach to Ukraine has played into Russian President Vladimir Putin\\u2019s hands.\\n\\n\\u201cThey accused us of doing nefarious things with this Lev Parnas character,\\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told Sean Hannity. \\u201cThe truth is Adam Schiff and the Democrats have been doing nefarious things with Parnas!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAdam's ordinarily not that stupid, but when you tell the jury, the Senate, on one day that they're corrupt, and then you tell the American people they cannot be trusted to pick the commander in chief, that's just a wildly stupid trial strategy,\\u201d former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told Bret Baier.\\n\\n-- Rudy Giuliani appeared on \\u201cFox & Friends\\u201d this morning to attack the Democratic managers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a complete show on the part of the Democrats, and they should be sued for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and they should pay for that hearing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to present over the next two to three weeks shocking crimes at the highest levels of both governments while the Senate is listening to a totally phony group of stories about non-impeachable offenses.\\u201d\\n\\nGiuliani has been promising for a while now to release said evidence. It has not been forthcoming, so take such claims with more than a grain of salt. The president\\u2019s lawyer also said for months that he was going to release a lengthy report rebutting former special counsel Bob Mueller\\u2019s findings on Russian interference and whether Trump obstructed justice. He never did.\\n\\n-- Meanwhile, thought leaders on the left have effusively praised Schiff's performance. Esquire\\u2019s Charlie Pierce calls Schiff the Daniel Webster of our time. Walter Dellinger, who was acting U.S. solicitor general under Bill Clinton, said Schiff offered \\u201cone of the most impressive performances by a lawyer I have ever seen.\\u201d MSNBC legal commentator Jason Johnson called Schiff\\u2019s opening statement on Wednesday \\u201ca speech that kids will be giving in 2060 at university projects.\\u201d Actress and activist Alyssa Milano, who has been attending the trial, said \\u201cit felt like you were watching a one-man show on Broadway.\\u201d\\n\\nStephen Colbert offered an early valentine to Schiff during his show. \\u201cIt was gratifying to see someone taking the constitutional responsibility of their office seriously,\\u201d the comedian told his viewers on CBS. Breaking out of character, he said that Schiff spoke \\u201cclearly, passionately, cogently, and, I believe, courageously.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Schiff \\u201cwell spoken\\u201d and said \\u201cdid a good job of creating a tapestry.\\u201d But other Republican senators have told reporters that Schiff was overly \\u201csmooth\\u201d or \\u201cslick,\\u201d which they meant as negatives. \\u201cIn a way I do feel like I\\u2019m introducing myself to a number of the senators,\\u201d Schiff told the Associated Press, adding that they\\u2019re \\u201cfinding I\\u2019m not the demon that I\\u2019m portrayed as on Fox.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope that four Republicans still might be persuaded to vote for witnesses. \\u201cJust about every Republican\\u2019s eyes were glued on Mr. Schiff,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a powerful rendition.\\u201d\\n\\n-- All eyes are on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). \\u201cPrivately, senior Senate Republicans expect the vote to seek witness testimony to fail, but they are watching Alexander and several other Republicans closely. And wherever Alexander comes down is almost sure to be the majority position in the Senate,\\u201d Politico reports. \\u201cHe's a retiring defender of the Senate as an institution who's occasionally bucked his party, but he also counts Mitch McConnell as a longtime ally. He's more hesitant to criticize Trump than are some other Republicans, but he also has said it was \\u2018inappropriate\\u2019 for Trump to ask foreign governments to investigate his political opponents. \\u2026 [Democrats] are holding out hope that Alexander will be their hero in the mold of the late Sen. John McCain, whose extraordinary vote derailed the GOP\\u2019s effort to repeal Obamacare.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump is keeping his distance from the Republicans who might vote to call witnesses after White House advisers warned the president that outreach wouldn\\u2019t help his cause. Democrats are also giving them space. Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report: \\u201cDemocrats say there is no serious effort to privately lobby the Republicans, with the party relying instead on public opinion and the House prosecutors to squeeze them into breaking ranks.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) played with blue and purple fidget spinners. These are popular toys for children. In contrast, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who will potentially cast decisive votes on witnesses, almost never moved from their second-row desks. \\u201cCollins is a furious note taker, while Murkowski just stares intensely at the speaker,\\u201d Paul Kane reports.\\n\\n-- Collins sent a handwritten note to Roberts before his admonishment of the lawyers for both sides in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The senior senator for Maine, facing a tough reelection fight, told WCSH-TV in her state that the debate had become \\u201ctoo personal,\\u201d and she said she got mad when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Senate Republicans of being part of a coverup. \\u201cI had heard both sides impugn the integrity of one another and also cast aspersions on the Senate,\\u201d Collins said. \\u201cThat is just not appropriate.\\u201d Collins said she\\u2019s undecided on witnesses but added that the Nadler comments won\\u2019t affect her decision.\\n\\n-- Fresh polling shows most Americans overwhelmingly think witnesses should testify. An AP-NORC poll shows that 7 in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his top aides to appear before the Senate, including most Republicans. The same survey found that 45 percent think Trump should be convicted, 40 percent said he should not be and 14 percent said they don\\u2019t know enough to have an opinion.\\n\\n-- But, but, but: \\u201cMitch McConnell doesn\\u2019t care what you think,\\u201d Ben Terris writes in a new profile of the majority leader. \\u201cHe just wants to win.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A growing number of Republican senators are pointing to Trump's threat to invoke executive privilege as an excuse to vote against even trying to call witnesses, CNN reports: \\u201cGOP senators are privately and publicly raising concerns that issuing subpoenas -- to top officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton and for documents blocked by the White House -- will only serve to drag out the proceedings. Plus, many say there's little appetite for such a time-consuming fight, given that legal battles may ultimately not be successful and could force the courts to rule on hugely consequential constitutional issues about the separation of powers between the branches of government.\\u201d\\n\\nMORE FROM THE TRIAL:\\n\\n-- Democrats used a significant chunk of time on Thursday to preemptively defend the Bidens, who they expect Trump\\u2019s lawyers to attack when they get the floor: \\u201cRep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine,\\u201d Seung Min Kim, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. \\u201cBut Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump\\u2019s defense team. \\u2026 Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn\\u2019t focus on Biden\\u2019s actions toward Ukraine until 2019 \\u2026 She also referenced a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \\u2026 and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden\\u2019s desire to see [prosecutor Viktor] Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy \\u2026 As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cBefore the trial officially began Thursday afternoon, dozens of senators from both parties entered a secure facility in the Senate basement to view a classified document provided by Jennifer Williams, a national security adviser to Vice President Pence. \\u2026 The document had been previously submitted to the House Intelligence Committee. Some senators spent only a few minutes in the facility; others stayed for the better part of an hour. Several Democrats emerged to say they didn\\u2019t understand why the document had been classified. \\u2018I don\\u2019t believe it\\u2019s being withheld from the public for national security reasons. It may be withheld for political security reasons,\\u2019 said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).\\u201d\\n\\n-- The favorite talking point for most Senate Republicans continues to be that they\\u2019re learning nothing new because House managers are repeating themselves. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters during last night\\u2019s dinner break that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day in the Senate.\\u201d Ironically, he had repeated throughout the day that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day.\\u201d He said the same thing to CNN in the morning.\\n\\n\\u201cFor them to say they\\u2019re bored, it has a lot to do with them not wanting to hear evidence,\\u201d countered Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \\u201cThey don\\u2019t want to hear that this president who they\\u2019re so busy supporting did these things. As I put it, the truth hurts.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Tomorrow\\u2019s timing: Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) tells reporters that Saturday\\u2019s session will likely start and end earlier than the past few days. Party leaders are still trying to negotiate a deal to start the day as early as 8 a.m. so they can wrap up by noon. This would allow Democratic presidential candidates to fly to Iowa for campaign events. The trial has started at 1 p.m. during the week so that Chief Justice John Roberts can participate in pre-scheduled Supreme Court oral arguments before crossing the street to preside over the trial in the Capitol.\\n\\n-- Pelosi may be half a world away from the Senate floor, but that doesn\\u2019t mean the speaker doesn\\u2019t have the trial under control. From the Times: \\u201cEven in her absence from the Capitol this week, as the speaker traveled through Poland and Israel \\u2026 she had her hand firmly on the tiller. \\u2026 In many ways, Ms. Pelosi is the eighth, largely unseen manager of the Democrats\\u2019 case. \\u2026 Ms. Pelosi has dispatched her handpicked House general counsel to sit at the table inside the Senate chamber, with the prosecutors acting as her eyes and ears. She reviewed all the managers\\u2019 written briefs before they were filed.\\\"\\n\\n-- A core argument from Democrats yesterday was that the framers didn\\u2019t believe a president needed to break the law in order to warrant impeachment. \\u201cThe Constitution is not a suicide pact,\\u201d said Nadler, one of the managers. \\u201cIt does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The House\\u2019s lawyers filed a motion with an appeals court last night that says Trump\\u2019s defense lawyers have contradicted, and therefore undermined, the Department of Justice\\u2019s position on subpoenas. Ann Marimow reports: \\u201cThe lawyers for [Pelosi] asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to rule quickly on the pair of separation-of-powers cases, which they said could affect the Senate proceedings. House Democrats went to court seeking testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn and access to secret grand jury evidence from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\\u2019s Russia investigation. Justice Department attorneys have urged the appeals court to stay out of what they say are political disputes between Congress and the White House.\\u201d But the president\\u2019s team is now telling the Senate that these are matters more properly left to the courts.\\n\\n-- The White House also stonewalled the Government Accountability Office when the independent congressional watchdog requested information about the freeze on Ukraine aid. From Politico: \\u201cThe White House responded to the [GAO\\u2019s] inquiry with a one-page letter on Dec. 20, citing a legal memo from the Office of Management and Budget that defended the hold on military aid as necessary to ensure spending the funds wouldn't \\u2018conflict with the President's foreign policy.\\u2019 \\u2026 The correspondence is part of what led GAO to \\u2026 conclude last week that Trump's decision to withhold military aid violated federal law.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Follow the money: The documents turned over by Lev Parnas, Giuliani\\u2019s former associate, provide details about the web of dark money that helped fund Trump\\u2019s Ukrainian gambit. From Bloomberg News: \\u201cMoney flowed to Giuliani and his cohorts from home loans, friends, relative strangers and wealthy businessmen, some with interests in the gas and energy sector. It even came from a lawyer for an embattled Ukrainian energy tycoon fighting extradition to the U.S. on a conspiracy charge. \\u2026 The travel arrangements could brush up against campaign finance laws. While Giuliani [and Parnas] can volunteer as much of their time as they want for a campaign, any subsidy for such work by third parties would generally need to be reported as a contribution, and money from foreign individuals would be illegal.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dana Milbank: \\\"John Roberts comes face to face with the mess he made.\\\"\\n\\u2022 Ruth Marcus: \\u201cA more assertive John Roberts would be a bad idea.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Brenda Wineapple, author of a book on Andrew Johnson\\u2019s impeachment: \\u201cIf John Roberts is seeking a role model, let\\u2019s hope it\\u2019s not Salmon Chase.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Michael Gerson: \\u201cRepublicans aren\\u2019t serving the country, or even the president.

Sarah Ellison reports: \\u201cPouring attention on regional talk-radio hosts is a classic Trumpworld move: giving relatively unknown characters proximity to the White House has paid off with a disproportionate amount of attention and praise lavished on the president and his agenda. \\u2026 The strategy has been particularly powerful as Trump and his team have engaged in what [Steve] Bannon calls \\u2018information warfare\\u2019 over the impeachment fight...\\u201d\\n\\n-- Kamala \\\"that-little-girl-was-me\\\" Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joe Biden to boost her standing in the veepstakes. From the New York Times: \\u201cSuch a move could lift Mr. Biden\\u2019s campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris\\u2019s chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California. An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial \\u2026 She and [Biden] have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Anita Hill told an Iowa crowd last night that it\\u2019s too late for Biden to apologize for the way he mistreated and diminished her when she testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991. \\u201cThe statute of limitations for his apology is up,\\u201d Hill said in response to a question from the audience at the University of Iowa, where she gave a lecture on ending sexual harassment. \\u201cWhat are you going to do about it?

Sean Sullivan reports: \\u201cCampaign officials have been pressing surrogates and other allies not to escalate combustible disputes that have recently become more personal, ... including a tense fight with Joe Biden, a separate altercation with [Elizabeth Warren] and a renewed schism with Hillary Clinton. \\u2026 But many Sanders supporters, and even some campaign aides, are inclined to take a more aggressive approach that they say will highlight important differences. \\u2026 Some close Sanders allies acknowledged the difficulty of balancing the passions of his loyal backers, inspired by his calls for a political revolution and his staunchly liberal platform, with the need to demonstrate a broader unity.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sanders\\u2019s rise in the polls means he\\u2019ll be talking more about his electability than a revolution. While speeches he\\u2019s made over the past two weeks still feature his signature call to action, he\\u2019s spending more time explaining to voters how policies like Medicare-for-all would work in their daily lives, as well as how he could beat Trump.

(Eugene Scott)\\n\\n-- Mike Bloomberg may be lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, but he\\u2019s attracted the president\\u2019s obsessive attention by baiting him with constant attack ads. Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer report: \\u201cThe president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him \\u2018Mini Mike\\u2019 to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials. \\u2018It\\u2019s very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,\\u2019 said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide \\u2026 Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. \\u2026 Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on \\u2018Fox & Friends\\u2019 on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as \\u2018dopes and babies.\\u2019 Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Former top supporters of Cory Booker accused Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s campaign of \\u201cchasing ambulances.\\u201d From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cThe phone calls to Amy Nielsen came around two hours apart. It was last Monday around 12 p.m., not long after the news broke, when her phone lit up with his name. By then, Nielsen considered Cory Booker \\u2018part of [her] family.\\u2019 \\u2026 So the end of his campaign felt \\u2026 like \\u2018a death.\\u2019 \\u2026 The next call came around 2:30 p.m., this time from an unknown number. It was Pete Buttigieg, calling to seek Nielsen\\u2019s support now that her candidate had made the decision to \\u2018step aside.\\u2019 \\u2026 \\u2018It was a gut punch \\u2014 like, really? He did not \\u2018step aside\\u2019 for you,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Like, wow, that\\u2019s some nerve right there.\\u2019 Later that night, she said, Nielsen heard from one of Booker\\u2019s field organizers who said she had already been contacted by the Buttigieg campaign to go door-knock.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Twelve years ago, Buttigieg spent the final week before the 2008 caucuses in rural southwest Iowa, trying to turn out voters for Barack Obama in one of the most conservative towns in the state. Holly Bailey spoke with him about what he learned: \\u201c\\u2018This was a new experience to really talk to people like this,\\u2019 Buttigieg recalled. \\u2018And what I found was, first of all, you can\\u2019t assume where somebody is going to be. We were in an area where a lot of people weren\\u2019t Democrats to begin with, and those who were were more likely to be for [John] Edwards. But they would hear us out when we were talking about Obama. And sometimes, as you do when you go door-to-door, somebody, because you represent a presidential campaign, would just pour out everything that was on their mind, everything they were upset about.\\\"\\n\\n\\u00ad-- Early voting means that millions are already eligible to cast their ballot. From the AP: \\u201cIn Minnesota, in-person early voting began Jan. 17. Vermont\\u2019s deadline to mail out its absentee ballots was the same day. Many of the 14 Super Tuesday states will offer some form of early voting between now and mid-February.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Howard County saw a bigger swing from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 than any other in Iowa. The Wall Street Journal's John McCormick took the pulse for 2020: \\u201cRecent interviews with dozens of voters here suggest that most of Mr. Trump\\u2019s 2016 supporters ... plan to stick with him, even though some said they have grown weary of his personal behavior and trade fights. Among those who previously voted for Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, many said they are reserving judgment until they see who wins the Democratic nomination. \\u2026 What such swing voters do in 2020 will have national implications. Before Mr. Trump, Howard County hadn\\u2019t backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. It is one of the 31 counties in Iowa\\u2014the most of any state\\u2014that backed Mr. Obama twice and then switched to Mr. Trump. The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A new Iowa caucus app is sparking election security concerns. From NBC News: \\u201cThe app will be used in Iowa and Nevada by caucus managers \\u2014 local registered Democrats who sign up to organize and run the caucus process in each location \\u2014 to expedite the process, calculate and assign delegates and report results back quickly. The app will also be used in satellite voting locations across the country and overseas. But questions about the app remain unanswered, including who developed it and whether it has been subjected to independent security testing. Security experts say that the app is a potential target for early election interference, particularly since it is downloaded on to the personal phones of the caucus managers. Party officials say operational security prevents them from disclosing specifics about the app.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Big-money groups aligned with the Senate GOP raised $68.3 million in 2019, an off-year record. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \\u201cThe majority of the money raised in 2019 came in the latter half of the year, particularly in the final two months, largely driven by the House Democrats\\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The ranks of scientists are growing thin in the Trump administration. Annie Gowen, Juliet Eilperin, Ben Guarino and Andrew Ba Tran report: \\u201cDozens of government computers sit in a nondescript building [in Kansas City, Mo.], able to connect to a data model that could help farmers manage the impact of a changing climate on their crops. But no one in this federal agency would know how to access the model, or, if they did, what to do with the data. That\\u2019s because the ambitious federal researcher who created it in Washington quit rather than move when the Agriculture Department relocated his agency to an office park here last fall. He is one of hundreds of scientists across the federal government who have been forced out, sidelined or muted since President Trump took office. \\u2026 In the first two years of the Trump administration, more than 1,600 federal scientists left government, according to Office of Personnel Management employment data \\u2026 That represents a 1.5 percent drop, compared with the 8 percent increase during the same period in the Obama administration.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Justice Department conceded that it had \\u201cinsufficient\\u201d cause to continue monitoring a former Trump campaign adviser during the Russia probe. Matt Zapotosky reports: \\u201cThe concession was revealed in an order posted on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\\u2019s website. In December, according to the order, the department told the court it had come to believe that in at least two of the four applications to monitor the former adviser, Carter Page, \\u2018there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause\\u2019 to believe he was acting as a Russian agent.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Trump administration will create additional new hurdles for pregnant foreign women seeking U.S. tourist visas. The administration said it's trying to crack down on what it calls \\u201cbirth tourism,\\\" trying to reduce what conservatives call \\\"anchor babies,\\\" by instructing consular officers to assess whether women requesting tourist visas are hoping to give birth on U.S. soil, which would effectively grant their children American citizenship. Starting today, the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor visas to women hoping to travel to the country with the stated purpose of having a child. Foggy Bottom said consular officers cannot require pregnancy tests to make the determination but wouldn\\u2019t rule out a woman\\u2019s physical appearance when making the decision, per Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti.\\n\\n-- Trump's \\\"national public health emergency\\\" declaration on the opioid crisis expired because his people at the Department of Health and Human Services forgot to renew it. An HHS spokesperson said the nine-day lapse had been corrected and blamed a clerical error. The emergency status, first announced in 2017 as a measure deemed necessary to direct more resources toward the drug overdose crisis, needs to be renewed every 90 days.

I was just trying to get him away from me, and he took my hands and put them over my head,\\u2019 Sciorra told the jury in Weinstein\\u2019s sexual assault trial, her eyes welling up with tears and her voice breaking. \\u2026 Weinstein, who had been watching her from the defense table, turned his gaze away from his accuser as she emotionally detailed the encounter. \\u2026 In her five hours of testimony, she described freezing after the attack, adding that \\u2018It was just so disgusting that my body started to shake.\\u2019 She said she had no romantic interest in Weinstein.

But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies. Adding to the stress, Friday marked the official start of \\u2026 when China celebrates the arrival of the new lunar year. Authorities around the country, including in the capital Beijing, have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the holiday to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could be spread. \\u2026The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was already entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice. Production companies have postponed the release of seven blockbuster films that were to be released over the holiday, leading Chinese cinema companies to close the country\\u2019s 70,000 movie theaters. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cThe National Health Commission reported Friday that there are now more than 830 confirmed cases of infection, and reports of new cases continued to roll in from around the country: from Xinjiang in the west to Shandong in the east, from Inner Mongolia in the north to Hainan in the south. A total of 8,420 were reported to be under observation. South Korean authorities confirmed Friday that a second person tested positive for the new coronavirus. \\u2026 Japan also confirmed a second case, a man in his 40s from Wuhan who arrived in Japan on Sunday on a flight through Hong Kong. Other countries to have reported infections including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to a confirmed case in Washington state, Texas has reported a potential case of coronavirus in Brazos County, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The patient contracted a respiratory illness within two weeks of traveling in Wuhan and is being isolated at home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\\n\\n\\u201cSome details about the latest deaths in China have raised concerns about the virus\\u2019s spread. Until now, the vast majority of the people had been older than 60 and almost all of them had existing health conditions. All of them had been in Hubei province \\u2026 But the latest announcement said that 36-year-old man from Wuhan, identified only by his family name, Li, died on Thursday. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions, and had been treated with anti-virus medication and antibiotics since being admitted to a hospital on Jan. 9.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Wall Street stumbled yesterday amid fears that efforts to curtail the virus could further disrupt the global economy.

(Meagan Flynn)\\n\\n-- Trump\\u2019s sanctions on Iran are fueling a new refugee crisis \\u2013 in Turkey. Erin Cunningham and Mohammad Mahdi Sultani report: \\u201cDecades ago, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted thousands of people to flee to neighboring Iran. Now, many of these refugees are once again seeking a new home in a new land, Turkey, desperate to escape the dire economic conditions fueled by U.S. sanctions on Tehran. \\u2026 Turkish authorities are grappling with nearly 4 million refugees. This is the world\\u2019s largest population of displaced people, according to the United Nations, including more than 170,000 registered Afghan refugees. Turkey has struggled to contain the influx even as aid agencies say the number of arrivals from Iran is on the rise.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A critic of the Saudi Arabian government said a suspected Saudi agent tried to kidnap him on U.S. soil, a claim backed up by multiple U.S. and foreign sources familiar with the episode. From the Daily Beast: \\u201cAbdulrahman Almutairi is a 27-year-old comedian and former student at the University of San Diego with a big social-media presence. After Almutairi used social media to criticize the powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman over the October 2018 murder and dismemberment of Washington Post contributor [Jamal] Khashoggi, an unidentified Saudi man accompanied Almutairi\\u2019s father on a flight to collect Almutairi against his will and bring him back to Saudi Arabia...\\\"\\n\\n-- The Trump administration has missed the deadline, established by law, to turn over to Congress an unclassified report on Khashoggi's murder and the role played by the regime in Riyadh. From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cIn December, lawmakers passed a sweeping defense bill that included a provision ordering the director of national intelligence to send Congress an unclassified report identifying those responsible for Khashoggi\\u2019s death at a Saudi Arabian consulate in 2018. The legislation set the deadline for the report at 30 days, which passed earlier this week.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A small team of FBI agents spent years trying to solve a stubborn mystery \\u2013 whether officials from Saudi Arabia were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. A team of ProPublica and NYT Magazine reporters tell their story: \\u201cThe FBI has disputed the idea that foreign-policy considerations significantly influenced its investigation. In interviews, current and former bureau officials and federal prosecutors insisted to us that they never would have hesitated to pursue any Saudi who could have been solidly linked to the 9/11 plot \\u2026 But others who worked on the matter, including some at the FBI\\u2019s highest levels, say that the United States\\u2019 complex and often-troubled relationship with the Saudi regime was an unavoidable fact throughout their investigations. Even as the Saudi authorities became more cooperative with the United States in fighting al-Qaida after 2003, they were minimally and grudgingly helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry. According to current and former officials, requests for assistance that might rattle the Saudi security agencies were frequently balanced against FBI and CIA needs for Saudi help against continuing terror threats.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival, Benny Gantz, next week to discuss his Middle East peace plan.

Col. Alexander Vindman as the model of courage that Senate Republicans should follow during President Trump's trial.\\n\\nThe House Intelligence chairman fought back emotion late last night as he recalled Vindman\\u2019s November appearance before his committee. Vindman was born in the Soviet Union, but his father brought him here when he was a young boy. The director of European Affairs on the National Security Council, who received a Purple Heart after he was injured in Iraq, said that his father worried when he told him he would testify. But he reassured him. \\u201cThis is America,\\u201d Vindman recalled telling his dad. \\u201cHere, right matters.\\u201d The audience broke into spontaneous applause.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, right is supposed to matter,\\u201d Schiff told senators last night in the 10 p.m. hour, wrapping up day two of his case against Trump, which he will conclude Friday afternoon. \\u201cIt\\u2019s what\\u2019s made us the greatest nation on Earth. No Constitution can protect us if right doesn\\u2019t matter anymore. You know you can\\u2019t trust this president to do what\\u2019s right for this country. You can trust that he will do what\\u2019s right for Donald Trump. He\\u2019ll do it now. He\\u2019ll do it for the next several months. He\\u2019ll do it in the election if he\\u2019s allowed to.

Schiff thanked senators last night for \\u201ckeeping an open mind about all of the issues we are presenting.\\u201d But, after Schiff spoke, Senate Republican leaders privately expressed growing confidence that they can win the vote next week to block additional witnesses from being summoned to testify. It\\u2019s not clear whether Schiff\\u2019s calls for courage have pushed any Republican senators toward breaking with the president and their party leaders on the key votes coming up next week surrounding summoning witnesses or subpoenaing documents.\\n\\n-- Schiff spoke a few hours after Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), one of the jurors, questioned Vindman\\u2019s patriotism by propagating an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory from the fever swamps of the dark corners of the pro-Trump fringe Internet. Blackburn claimed that Vindman once badmouthed the United States to Russians while serving overseas. \\u201cAdam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot,\\u201d she tweeted. \\u201cHow patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America\\u2019s greatest enemy?\\u201d\\n\\nVindman\\u2019s lawyer, former ambassador David Pressman, accused Blackburn of defaming his client. \\u201cThat a member of the Senate \\u2014 at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility \\u2014 would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice,\\u201d Pressman emailed. \\u201cWhile Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\\u201d\\n\\nBlackburn isn\\u2019t backing down and tweeted another attack around 8 p.m. Trump himself retweeted her this morning. The senator, who won Bob Corker's seat after he retired in 2018, has also accused Vindman of being a \\u201chandler\\u201d for the whistleblower who filed the complaint. Vindman testified before Schiff\\u2019s committee that he spoke with an intelligence community official about Trump\\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he declined to identify the official on the advice of counsel because he said he didn\\u2019t want to blow someone\\u2019s cover. But no public evidence exists that he was a source for the whistleblower.\\n\\n-- Schiff, a mild-mannered former federal prosecutor, has emerged as a surprisingly polarizing figure. Perhaps it\\u2019s because the president has accused him of committing treason, in addition to calling him \\u201cpencil neck\\u201d and \\u201cliddle.\\u201d Trump has now tweeted about Schiff hundreds of times. Schiff\\u2019s boosters say the right only loathes him because he\\u2019s so effective.\\n\\n-- The president\\u2019s allies at Fox News have elevated Schiff this week into perhaps the biggest boogeyman for their audience. Arguably he\\u2019s a bigger target of their vitriol right now than Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders or even the four minority women in the Squad. If you\\u2019ve watched the network for even a few minutes this week, especially in primetime, you\\u2019ve probably seen hosts and guests attacking the man from Burbank.\\n\\nTucker Carlson continued his mockery last night of the man he\\u2019s taken to calling \\u201cSaint Adam,\\u201d a nickname intended to convey what he portrays as the congressman\\u2019s sanctimoniousness. \\u201cSay what you will, but as a piece of theater, it had literally everything,\\u201d Carlson said after playing a video clip of Schiff talking on the Senate floor about how Trump\\u2019s approach to Ukraine has played into Russian President Vladimir Putin\\u2019s hands.\\n\\n\\u201cThey accused us of doing nefarious things with this Lev Parnas character,\\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told Sean Hannity. \\u201cThe truth is Adam Schiff and the Democrats have been doing nefarious things with Parnas!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAdam's ordinarily not that stupid, but when you tell the jury, the Senate, on one day that they're corrupt, and then you tell the American people they cannot be trusted to pick the commander in chief, that's just a wildly stupid trial strategy,\\u201d former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told Bret Baier.\\n\\n-- Rudy Giuliani appeared on \\u201cFox & Friends\\u201d this morning to attack the Democratic managers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a complete show on the part of the Democrats, and they should be sued for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and they should pay for that hearing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to present over the next two to three weeks shocking crimes at the highest levels of both governments while the Senate is listening to a totally phony group of stories about non-impeachable offenses.\\u201d\\n\\nGiuliani has been promising for a while now to release said evidence. It has not been forthcoming, so take such claims with more than a grain of salt. The president\\u2019s lawyer also said for months that he was going to release a lengthy report rebutting former special counsel Bob Mueller\\u2019s findings on Russian interference and whether Trump obstructed justice. He never did.\\n\\n-- Meanwhile, thought leaders on the left have effusively praised Schiff's performance. Esquire\\u2019s Charlie Pierce calls Schiff the Daniel Webster of our time. Walter Dellinger, who was acting U.S. solicitor general under Bill Clinton, said Schiff offered \\u201cone of the most impressive performances by a lawyer I have ever seen.\\u201d MSNBC legal commentator Jason Johnson called Schiff\\u2019s opening statement on Wednesday \\u201ca speech that kids will be giving in 2060 at university projects.\\u201d Actress and activist Alyssa Milano, who has been attending the trial, said \\u201cit felt like you were watching a one-man show on Broadway.\\u201d\\n\\nStephen Colbert offered an early valentine to Schiff during his show. \\u201cIt was gratifying to see someone taking the constitutional responsibility of their office seriously,\\u201d the comedian told his viewers on CBS. Breaking out of character, he said that Schiff spoke \\u201cclearly, passionately, cogently, and, I believe, courageously.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Schiff \\u201cwell spoken\\u201d and said \\u201cdid a good job of creating a tapestry.\\u201d But other Republican senators have told reporters that Schiff was overly \\u201csmooth\\u201d or \\u201cslick,\\u201d which they meant as negatives. \\u201cIn a way I do feel like I\\u2019m introducing myself to a number of the senators,\\u201d Schiff told the Associated Press, adding that they\\u2019re \\u201cfinding I\\u2019m not the demon that I\\u2019m portrayed as on Fox.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope that four Republicans still might be persuaded to vote for witnesses. \\u201cJust about every Republican\\u2019s eyes were glued on Mr. Schiff,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a powerful rendition.\\u201d\\n\\n-- All eyes are on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). \\u201cPrivately, senior Senate Republicans expect the vote to seek witness testimony to fail, but they are watching Alexander and several other Republicans closely. And wherever Alexander comes down is almost sure to be the majority position in the Senate,\\u201d Politico reports. \\u201cHe's a retiring defender of the Senate as an institution who's occasionally bucked his party, but he also counts Mitch McConnell as a longtime ally. He's more hesitant to criticize Trump than are some other Republicans, but he also has said it was \\u2018inappropriate\\u2019 for Trump to ask foreign governments to investigate his political opponents. \\u2026 [Democrats] are holding out hope that Alexander will be their hero in the mold of the late Sen. John McCain, whose extraordinary vote derailed the GOP\\u2019s effort to repeal Obamacare.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump is keeping his distance from the Republicans who might vote to call witnesses after White House advisers warned the president that outreach wouldn\\u2019t help his cause. Democrats are also giving them space. Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report: \\u201cDemocrats say there is no serious effort to privately lobby the Republicans, with the party relying instead on public opinion and the House prosecutors to squeeze them into breaking ranks.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) played with blue and purple fidget spinners. These are popular toys for children. In contrast, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who will potentially cast decisive votes on witnesses, almost never moved from their second-row desks. \\u201cCollins is a furious note taker, while Murkowski just stares intensely at the speaker,\\u201d Paul Kane reports.\\n\\n-- Collins sent a handwritten note to Roberts before his admonishment of the lawyers for both sides in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The senior senator for Maine, facing a tough reelection fight, told WCSH-TV in her state that the debate had become \\u201ctoo personal,\\u201d and she said she got mad when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Senate Republicans of being part of a coverup. \\u201cI had heard both sides impugn the integrity of one another and also cast aspersions on the Senate,\\u201d Collins said. \\u201cThat is just not appropriate.\\u201d Collins said she\\u2019s undecided on witnesses but added that the Nadler comments won\\u2019t affect her decision.\\n\\n-- Fresh polling shows most Americans overwhelmingly think witnesses should testify. An AP-NORC poll shows that 7 in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his top aides to appear before the Senate, including most Republicans. The same survey found that 45 percent think Trump should be convicted, 40 percent said he should not be and 14 percent said they don\\u2019t know enough to have an opinion.\\n\\n-- But, but, but: \\u201cMitch McConnell doesn\\u2019t care what you think,\\u201d Ben Terris writes in a new profile of the majority leader. \\u201cHe just wants to win.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A growing number of Republican senators are pointing to Trump's threat to invoke executive privilege as an excuse to vote against even trying to call witnesses, CNN reports: \\u201cGOP senators are privately and publicly raising concerns that issuing subpoenas -- to top officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton and for documents blocked by the White House -- will only serve to drag out the proceedings. Plus, many say there's little appetite for such a time-consuming fight, given that legal battles may ultimately not be successful and could force the courts to rule on hugely consequential constitutional issues about the separation of powers between the branches of government.\\u201d\\n\\nMORE FROM THE TRIAL:\\n\\n-- Democrats used a significant chunk of time on Thursday to preemptively defend the Bidens, who they expect Trump\\u2019s lawyers to attack when they get the floor: \\u201cRep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine,\\u201d Seung Min Kim, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. \\u201cBut Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump\\u2019s defense team. \\u2026 Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn\\u2019t focus on Biden\\u2019s actions toward Ukraine until 2019 \\u2026 She also referenced a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \\u2026 and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden\\u2019s desire to see [prosecutor Viktor] Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy \\u2026 As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cBefore the trial officially began Thursday afternoon, dozens of senators from both parties entered a secure facility in the Senate basement to view a classified document provided by Jennifer Williams, a national security adviser to Vice President Pence. \\u2026 The document had been previously submitted to the House Intelligence Committee. Some senators spent only a few minutes in the facility; others stayed for the better part of an hour. Several Democrats emerged to say they didn\\u2019t understand why the document had been classified. \\u2018I don\\u2019t believe it\\u2019s being withheld from the public for national security reasons. It may be withheld for political security reasons,\\u2019 said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).\\u201d\\n\\n-- The favorite talking point for most Senate Republicans continues to be that they\\u2019re learning nothing new because House managers are repeating themselves. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters during last night\\u2019s dinner break that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day in the Senate.\\u201d Ironically, he had repeated throughout the day that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day.\\u201d He said the same thing to CNN in the morning.\\n\\n\\u201cFor them to say they\\u2019re bored, it has a lot to do with them not wanting to hear evidence,\\u201d countered Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \\u201cThey don\\u2019t want to hear that this president who they\\u2019re so busy supporting did these things. As I put it, the truth hurts.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Tomorrow\\u2019s timing: Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) tells reporters that Saturday\\u2019s session will likely start and end earlier than the past few days. Party leaders are still trying to negotiate a deal to start the day as early as 8 a.m. so they can wrap up by noon. This would allow Democratic presidential candidates to fly to Iowa for campaign events. The trial has started at 1 p.m. during the week so that Chief Justice John Roberts can participate in pre-scheduled Supreme Court oral arguments before crossing the street to preside over the trial in the Capitol.\\n\\n-- Pelosi may be half a world away from the Senate floor, but that doesn\\u2019t mean the speaker doesn\\u2019t have the trial under control. From the Times: \\u201cEven in her absence from the Capitol this week, as the speaker traveled through Poland and Israel \\u2026 she had her hand firmly on the tiller. \\u2026 In many ways, Ms. Pelosi is the eighth, largely unseen manager of the Democrats\\u2019 case. \\u2026 Ms. Pelosi has dispatched her handpicked House general counsel to sit at the table inside the Senate chamber, with the prosecutors acting as her eyes and ears. She reviewed all the managers\\u2019 written briefs before they were filed.\\\"\\n\\n-- A core argument from Democrats yesterday was that the framers didn\\u2019t believe a president needed to break the law in order to warrant impeachment. \\u201cThe Constitution is not a suicide pact,\\u201d said Nadler, one of the managers. \\u201cIt does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The House\\u2019s lawyers filed a motion with an appeals court last night that says Trump\\u2019s defense lawyers have contradicted, and therefore undermined, the Department of Justice\\u2019s position on subpoenas. Ann Marimow reports: \\u201cThe lawyers for [Pelosi] asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to rule quickly on the pair of separation-of-powers cases, which they said could affect the Senate proceedings. House Democrats went to court seeking testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn and access to secret grand jury evidence from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\\u2019s Russia investigation. Justice Department attorneys have urged the appeals court to stay out of what they say are political disputes between Congress and the White House.\\u201d But the president\\u2019s team is now telling the Senate that these are matters more properly left to the courts.\\n\\n-- The White House also stonewalled the Government Accountability Office when the independent congressional watchdog requested information about the freeze on Ukraine aid. From Politico: \\u201cThe White House responded to the [GAO\\u2019s] inquiry with a one-page letter on Dec. 20, citing a legal memo from the Office of Management and Budget that defended the hold on military aid as necessary to ensure spending the funds wouldn't \\u2018conflict with the President's foreign policy.\\u2019 \\u2026 The correspondence is part of what led GAO to \\u2026 conclude last week that Trump's decision to withhold military aid violated federal law.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Follow the money: The documents turned over by Lev Parnas, Giuliani\\u2019s former associate, provide details about the web of dark money that helped fund Trump\\u2019s Ukrainian gambit. From Bloomberg News: \\u201cMoney flowed to Giuliani and his cohorts from home loans, friends, relative strangers and wealthy businessmen, some with interests in the gas and energy sector. It even came from a lawyer for an embattled Ukrainian energy tycoon fighting extradition to the U.S. on a conspiracy charge. \\u2026 The travel arrangements could brush up against campaign finance laws. While Giuliani [and Parnas] can volunteer as much of their time as they want for a campaign, any subsidy for such work by third parties would generally need to be reported as a contribution, and money from foreign individuals would be illegal.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dana Milbank: \\\"John Roberts comes face to face with the mess he made.\\\"\\n\\u2022 Ruth Marcus: \\u201cA more assertive John Roberts would be a bad idea.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Brenda Wineapple, author of a book on Andrew Johnson\\u2019s impeachment: \\u201cIf John Roberts is seeking a role model, let\\u2019s hope it\\u2019s not Salmon Chase.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Michael Gerson: \\u201cRepublicans aren\\u2019t serving the country, or even the president. Just themselves.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Eugene Robinson: \\u201cSenate Republicans\\u2019 defense of Trump is as mushy as apple pie.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Garret Graff, founding director of the Aspen Institute\\u2019s Cyber & Technology Program: \\u201cTrump won\\u2019t protect our elections, so private companies are doing it.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dan Drezner: \\u201cWhen American political institutions give up: After three years of Trump, there have been some unhealthy adjustments.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Regional radio hosts across the country have found themselves showered with attention by senior Trump officials, who have made accessibility to local conservative talking heads a central part of the president\\u2019s reelection strategy. Sarah Ellison reports: \\u201cPouring attention on regional talk-radio hosts is a classic Trumpworld move: giving relatively unknown characters proximity to the White House has paid off with a disproportionate amount of attention and praise lavished on the president and his agenda. \\u2026 The strategy has been particularly powerful as Trump and his team have engaged in what [Steve] Bannon calls \\u2018information warfare\\u2019 over the impeachment fight...\\u201d\\n\\n-- Kamala \\\"that-little-girl-was-me\\\" Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joe Biden to boost her standing in the veepstakes. From the New York Times: \\u201cSuch a move could lift Mr. Biden\\u2019s campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris\\u2019s chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California. An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial \\u2026 She and [Biden] have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Anita Hill told an Iowa crowd last night that it\\u2019s too late for Biden to apologize for the way he mistreated and diminished her when she testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991. \\u201cThe statute of limitations for his apology is up,\\u201d Hill said in response to a question from the audience at the University of Iowa, where she gave a lecture on ending sexual harassment. \\u201cWhat are you going to do about it? What are you going to do today? Will you promise as leader of this country \\u2026 to use all of your energy to address the problem as it happened and to prevent it from happening to another generation? That\\u2019s what I want to hear. And I not only want to hear from him, I want to hear from every one of them who want to be the leader of this country.\\u201d (BuzzFeed News)\\n\\n-- Bernie Sanders asked his supporters to cool it \\u2013 but they don\\u2019t always listen. Sean Sullivan reports: \\u201cCampaign officials have been pressing surrogates and other allies not to escalate combustible disputes that have recently become more personal, ... including a tense fight with Joe Biden, a separate altercation with [Elizabeth Warren] and a renewed schism with Hillary Clinton. \\u2026 But many Sanders supporters, and even some campaign aides, are inclined to take a more aggressive approach that they say will highlight important differences. \\u2026 Some close Sanders allies acknowledged the difficulty of balancing the passions of his loyal backers, inspired by his calls for a political revolution and his staunchly liberal platform, with the need to demonstrate a broader unity.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sanders\\u2019s rise in the polls means he\\u2019ll be talking more about his electability than a revolution. While speeches he\\u2019s made over the past two weeks still feature his signature call to action, he\\u2019s spending more time explaining to voters how policies like Medicare-for-all would work in their daily lives, as well as how he could beat Trump. (Bloomberg News)\\n\\n-- One in five women doubt that a woman can win the presidency, according to a new CNN poll. What\\u2019s telling about this news is that just 9 percent of men said the same. (Eugene Scott)\\n\\n-- Mike Bloomberg may be lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, but he\\u2019s attracted the president\\u2019s obsessive attention by baiting him with constant attack ads. Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer report: \\u201cThe president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him \\u2018Mini Mike\\u2019 to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials. \\u2018It\\u2019s very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,\\u2019 said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide \\u2026 Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. \\u2026 Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on \\u2018Fox & Friends\\u2019 on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as \\u2018dopes and babies.\\u2019 Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Former top supporters of Cory Booker accused Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s campaign of \\u201cchasing ambulances.\\u201d From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cThe phone calls to Amy Nielsen came around two hours apart. It was last Monday around 12 p.m., not long after the news broke, when her phone lit up with his name. By then, Nielsen considered Cory Booker \\u2018part of [her] family.\\u2019 \\u2026 So the end of his campaign felt \\u2026 like \\u2018a death.\\u2019 \\u2026 The next call came around 2:30 p.m., this time from an unknown number. It was Pete Buttigieg, calling to seek Nielsen\\u2019s support now that her candidate had made the decision to \\u2018step aside.\\u2019 \\u2026 \\u2018It was a gut punch \\u2014 like, really? He did not \\u2018step aside\\u2019 for you,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Like, wow, that\\u2019s some nerve right there.\\u2019 Later that night, she said, Nielsen heard from one of Booker\\u2019s field organizers who said she had already been contacted by the Buttigieg campaign to go door-knock.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Twelve years ago, Buttigieg spent the final week before the 2008 caucuses in rural southwest Iowa, trying to turn out voters for Barack Obama in one of the most conservative towns in the state. Holly Bailey spoke with him about what he learned: \\u201c\\u2018This was a new experience to really talk to people like this,\\u2019 Buttigieg recalled. \\u2018And what I found was, first of all, you can\\u2019t assume where somebody is going to be. We were in an area where a lot of people weren\\u2019t Democrats to begin with, and those who were were more likely to be for [John] Edwards. But they would hear us out when we were talking about Obama. And sometimes, as you do when you go door-to-door, somebody, because you represent a presidential campaign, would just pour out everything that was on their mind, everything they were upset about.\\\"\\n\\n\\u00ad-- Early voting means that millions are already eligible to cast their ballot. From the AP: \\u201cIn Minnesota, in-person early voting began Jan. 17. Vermont\\u2019s deadline to mail out its absentee ballots was the same day. Many of the 14 Super Tuesday states will offer some form of early voting between now and mid-February.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Howard County saw a bigger swing from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 than any other in Iowa. The Wall Street Journal's John McCormick took the pulse for 2020: \\u201cRecent interviews with dozens of voters here suggest that most of Mr. Trump\\u2019s 2016 supporters ... plan to stick with him, even though some said they have grown weary of his personal behavior and trade fights. Among those who previously voted for Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, many said they are reserving judgment until they see who wins the Democratic nomination. \\u2026 What such swing voters do in 2020 will have national implications. Before Mr. Trump, Howard County hadn\\u2019t backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. It is one of the 31 counties in Iowa\\u2014the most of any state\\u2014that backed Mr. Obama twice and then switched to Mr. Trump. The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A new Iowa caucus app is sparking election security concerns. From NBC News: \\u201cThe app will be used in Iowa and Nevada by caucus managers \\u2014 local registered Democrats who sign up to organize and run the caucus process in each location \\u2014 to expedite the process, calculate and assign delegates and report results back quickly. The app will also be used in satellite voting locations across the country and overseas. But questions about the app remain unanswered, including who developed it and whether it has been subjected to independent security testing. Security experts say that the app is a potential target for early election interference, particularly since it is downloaded on to the personal phones of the caucus managers. Party officials say operational security prevents them from disclosing specifics about the app.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Big-money groups aligned with the Senate GOP raised $68.3 million in 2019, an off-year record. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \\u201cThe majority of the money raised in 2019 came in the latter half of the year, particularly in the final two months, largely driven by the House Democrats\\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The ranks of scientists are growing thin in the Trump administration. Annie Gowen, Juliet Eilperin, Ben Guarino and Andrew Ba Tran report: \\u201cDozens of government computers sit in a nondescript building [in Kansas City, Mo.], able to connect to a data model that could help farmers manage the impact of a changing climate on their crops. But no one in this federal agency would know how to access the model, or, if they did, what to do with the data. That\\u2019s because the ambitious federal researcher who created it in Washington quit rather than move when the Agriculture Department relocated his agency to an office park here last fall. He is one of hundreds of scientists across the federal government who have been forced out, sidelined or muted since President Trump took office. \\u2026 In the first two years of the Trump administration, more than 1,600 federal scientists left government, according to Office of Personnel Management employment data \\u2026 That represents a 1.5 percent drop, compared with the 8 percent increase during the same period in the Obama administration.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Justice Department conceded that it had \\u201cinsufficient\\u201d cause to continue monitoring a former Trump campaign adviser during the Russia probe. Matt Zapotosky reports: \\u201cThe concession was revealed in an order posted on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\\u2019s website. In December, according to the order, the department told the court it had come to believe that in at least two of the four applications to monitor the former adviser, Carter Page, \\u2018there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause\\u2019 to believe he was acting as a Russian agent.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Trump administration will create additional new hurdles for pregnant foreign women seeking U.S. tourist visas. The administration said it's trying to crack down on what it calls \\u201cbirth tourism,\\\" trying to reduce what conservatives call \\\"anchor babies,\\\" by instructing consular officers to assess whether women requesting tourist visas are hoping to give birth on U.S. soil, which would effectively grant their children American citizenship. Starting today, the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor visas to women hoping to travel to the country with the stated purpose of having a child. Foggy Bottom said consular officers cannot require pregnancy tests to make the determination but wouldn\\u2019t rule out a woman\\u2019s physical appearance when making the decision, per Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti.\\n\\n-- Trump's \\\"national public health emergency\\\" declaration on the opioid crisis expired because his people at the Department of Health and Human Services forgot to renew it. An HHS spokesperson said the nine-day lapse had been corrected and blamed a clerical error. The emergency status, first announced in 2017 as a measure deemed necessary to direct more resources toward the drug overdose crisis, needs to be renewed every 90 days. (Politico)\\n\\n-- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, 17, needs to study economics before offering her thoughts on climate change. Heather Long reports from Davos: \\u201cThunberg and Mnuchin are both attending the World Economic Forum this week. \\u2026 At a news conference on Thursday, Mnuchin was asked for his reaction to Thunberg\\u2019s insistence on fossil fuel divestment. \\u2018Who is she?\\u2019 he tried to joke to reporters before taking a jab at Thunberg, suggesting she didn\\u2019t understand what she was talking about. \\u2026 \\u2018Is she the chief economist or who is she? I\\u2019m confused. ... After she goes and studies economics in college she can go back and explain that to us.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\n-- Actress Annabella Sciorra, who played Gloria in \\\"The Sopranos,\\\" testified that Harvey Weinstein raped her more than 25 years ago. Shayna Jacobs reports: \\u201c\\u2018I was punching him. I was kicking him. I was just trying to get him away from me, and he took my hands and put them over my head,\\u2019 Sciorra told the jury in Weinstein\\u2019s sexual assault trial, her eyes welling up with tears and her voice breaking. \\u2026 Weinstein, who had been watching her from the defense table, turned his gaze away from his accuser as she emotionally detailed the encounter. \\u2026 In her five hours of testimony, she described freezing after the attack, adding that \\u2018It was just so disgusting that my body started to shake.\\u2019 She said she had no romantic interest in Weinstein. The film producer arrived at her Manhattan apartment uninvited one night.\\u201d\\n\\n-- \\u201cA young, healthy man from Wuhan and a person living 1,500 miles from the epicenter of the coronavirus are among the latest victims of the outbreak, which has incited fear and anger across China as the important Spring Festival gets underway,\\u201d Anna Fifield reports from Beijing. \\u201cReports of eight new deaths from the pneumonia-like virus, taking the total to 26, came as authorities enforced a lockdown across large parts of the province of Hubei, population 59 million. But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies. Adding to the stress, Friday marked the official start of \\u2026 when China celebrates the arrival of the new lunar year. Authorities around the country, including in the capital Beijing, have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the holiday to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could be spread. \\u2026The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was already entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice. Production companies have postponed the release of seven blockbuster films that were to be released over the holiday, leading Chinese cinema companies to close the country\\u2019s 70,000 movie theaters. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cThe National Health Commission reported Friday that there are now more than 830 confirmed cases of infection, and reports of new cases continued to roll in from around the country: from Xinjiang in the west to Shandong in the east, from Inner Mongolia in the north to Hainan in the south. A total of 8,420 were reported to be under observation. South Korean authorities confirmed Friday that a second person tested positive for the new coronavirus. \\u2026 Japan also confirmed a second case, a man in his 40s from Wuhan who arrived in Japan on Sunday on a flight through Hong Kong. Other countries to have reported infections including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to a confirmed case in Washington state, Texas has reported a potential case of coronavirus in Brazos County, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The patient contracted a respiratory illness within two weeks of traveling in Wuhan and is being isolated at home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\\n\\n\\u201cSome details about the latest deaths in China have raised concerns about the virus\\u2019s spread. Until now, the vast majority of the people had been older than 60 and almost all of them had existing health conditions. All of them had been in Hubei province \\u2026 But the latest announcement said that 36-year-old man from Wuhan, identified only by his family name, Li, died on Thursday. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions, and had been treated with anti-virus medication and antibiotics since being admitted to a hospital on Jan. 9.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Wall Street stumbled yesterday amid fears that efforts to curtail the virus could further disrupt the global economy. (David Lynch)\\n\\n-- The U.S. has officially refused to extradite Anne Sacoolas, the diplomat\\u2019s wife who fled the U.K. to avoid facing charges for killing a British teen by driving on the wrong side of the road. A State Department spokesman said extraditing Sacoolas would \\u201cset an extraordinarily troubling precedent\\u201d but did not elaborate. (Meagan Flynn)\\n\\n-- Trump\\u2019s sanctions on Iran are fueling a new refugee crisis \\u2013 in Turkey. Erin Cunningham and Mohammad Mahdi Sultani report: \\u201cDecades ago, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted thousands of people to flee to neighboring Iran. Now, many of these refugees are once again seeking a new home in a new land, Turkey, desperate to escape the dire economic conditions fueled by U.S. sanctions on Tehran. \\u2026 Turkish authorities are grappling with nearly 4 million refugees. This is the world\\u2019s largest population of displaced people, according to the United Nations, including more than 170,000 registered Afghan refugees. Turkey has struggled to contain the influx even as aid agencies say the number of arrivals from Iran is on the rise.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A critic of the Saudi Arabian government said a suspected Saudi agent tried to kidnap him on U.S. soil, a claim backed up by multiple U.S. and foreign sources familiar with the episode. From the Daily Beast: \\u201cAbdulrahman Almutairi is a 27-year-old comedian and former student at the University of San Diego with a big social-media presence. After Almutairi used social media to criticize the powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman over the October 2018 murder and dismemberment of Washington Post contributor [Jamal] Khashoggi, an unidentified Saudi man accompanied Almutairi\\u2019s father on a flight to collect Almutairi against his will and bring him back to Saudi Arabia...\\\"\\n\\n-- The Trump administration has missed the deadline, established by law, to turn over to Congress an unclassified report on Khashoggi's murder and the role played by the regime in Riyadh. From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cIn December, lawmakers passed a sweeping defense bill that included a provision ordering the director of national intelligence to send Congress an unclassified report identifying those responsible for Khashoggi\\u2019s death at a Saudi Arabian consulate in 2018. The legislation set the deadline for the report at 30 days, which passed earlier this week.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A small team of FBI agents spent years trying to solve a stubborn mystery \\u2013 whether officials from Saudi Arabia were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. A team of ProPublica and NYT Magazine reporters tell their story: \\u201cThe FBI has disputed the idea that foreign-policy considerations significantly influenced its investigation. In interviews, current and former bureau officials and federal prosecutors insisted to us that they never would have hesitated to pursue any Saudi who could have been solidly linked to the 9/11 plot \\u2026 But others who worked on the matter, including some at the FBI\\u2019s highest levels, say that the United States\\u2019 complex and often-troubled relationship with the Saudi regime was an unavoidable fact throughout their investigations. Even as the Saudi authorities became more cooperative with the United States in fighting al-Qaida after 2003, they were minimally and grudgingly helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry. According to current and former officials, requests for assistance that might rattle the Saudi security agencies were frequently balanced against FBI and CIA needs for Saudi help against continuing terror threats.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival, Benny Gantz, next week to discuss his Middle East peace plan. The meeting comes amid Trump\\u2019s trial, as well as Netanyahu and Gantz\\u2019s own troubles at home, where they\\u2019ve both failed to form a government.

CrisisFACTS-010-News-74-11,CrisisFACTS-010,here right is supposed to matter schiff told senators last night in the 10 pm hour wrapping up day two of his case against trump which he will conclude friday afternoon,"{\"id\": \"washingtonpost--2020-01-24--The Daily 202: \\u2018Right matters.\\u2019 Adam Schiff quotes Alexander Vindman in plea to unmoved GOP senators\", \"date\": \"2020-01-24\", \"source\": \"washingtonpost\", \"title\": \"The Daily 202: \\u2018Right matters.\\u2019 Adam Schiff quotes Alexander Vindman in plea to unmoved GOP senators.\", \"content\": \"THE BIG IDEA: Lead House impeachment manager Adam Schiff has repeatedly held up Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman as the model of courage that Senate Republicans should follow during President Trump's trial.\\n\\nThe House Intelligence chairman fought back emotion late last night as he recalled Vindman\\u2019s November appearance before his committee. Vindman was born in the Soviet Union, but his father brought him here when he was a young boy. The director of European Affairs on the National Security Council, who received a Purple Heart after he was injured in Iraq, said that his father worried when he told him he would testify. But he reassured him. \\u201cThis is America,\\u201d Vindman recalled telling his dad. \\u201cHere, right matters.\\u201d The audience broke into spontaneous applause.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, right is supposed to matter,\\u201d Schiff told senators last night in the 10 p.m. hour, wrapping up day two of his case against Trump, which he will conclude Friday afternoon. \\u201cIt\\u2019s what\\u2019s made us the greatest nation on Earth. No Constitution can protect us if right doesn\\u2019t matter anymore. You know you can\\u2019t trust this president to do what\\u2019s right for this country. You can trust that he will do what\\u2019s right for Donald Trump. He\\u2019ll do it now. He\\u2019ll do it for the next several months. He\\u2019ll do it in the election if he\\u2019s allowed to. This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Democrat from California has repeatedly praised Vindman and others for \\u201csticking their necks out\\u201d to answer questions about the president\\u2019s alleged Ukraine coercion campaign when his former bosses, including ex-national security adviser John Bolton, refused to come before the House. \\u201cI have such admiration for the fact they did,\\u201d Schiff said on Wednesday. \\u201cBut what would really vindicate that leap of faith \\u2026 is if we show the same courage. They risked everything\\u2014their careers\\u2014and, yes, I know what you are asked to decide may risk yours too, but if they could show the courage, so can we.\\u201d\\n\\nOver the course of several hours earlier in the afternoon, Schiff had laid out 10 separate arguments for why Trump\\u2019s push to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden was intended for the president\\u2019s personal benefit and not to advance the national interest. \\u201cWhen we\\u2019re done, we believe that we will have made the case overwhelmingly that the president is guilty,\\u201d Schiff said. \\u201cIs there really any doubt about this? I mean, do we really have any doubt about the facts here? Does anybody really question whether the president is capable of what he\\u2019s charged with? No one is really making the argument Donald Trump would never do such a thing \\u2026 because, of course, we know that he would.\\u201d\\n\\nVindman remains assigned to the White House, something that has drawn the continuing ire of pro-Trump commentators. Schiff thanked senators last night for \\u201ckeeping an open mind about all of the issues we are presenting.\\u201d But, after Schiff spoke, Senate Republican leaders privately expressed growing confidence that they can win the vote next week to block additional witnesses from being summoned to testify. It\\u2019s not clear whether Schiff\\u2019s calls for courage have pushed any Republican senators toward breaking with the president and their party leaders on the key votes coming up next week surrounding summoning witnesses or subpoenaing documents.\\n\\n-- Schiff spoke a few hours after Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), one of the jurors, questioned Vindman\\u2019s patriotism by propagating an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory from the fever swamps of the dark corners of the pro-Trump fringe Internet. Blackburn claimed that Vindman once badmouthed the United States to Russians while serving overseas. \\u201cAdam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot,\\u201d she tweeted. \\u201cHow patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America\\u2019s greatest enemy?\\u201d\\n\\nVindman\\u2019s lawyer, former ambassador David Pressman, accused Blackburn of defaming his client. \\u201cThat a member of the Senate \\u2014 at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility \\u2014 would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice,\\u201d Pressman emailed. \\u201cWhile Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\\u201d\\n\\nBlackburn isn\\u2019t backing down and tweeted another attack around 8 p.m. Trump himself retweeted her this morning. The senator, who won Bob Corker's seat after he retired in 2018, has also accused Vindman of being a \\u201chandler\\u201d for the whistleblower who filed the complaint. Vindman testified before Schiff\\u2019s committee that he spoke with an intelligence community official about Trump\\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he declined to identify the official on the advice of counsel because he said he didn\\u2019t want to blow someone\\u2019s cover. But no public evidence exists that he was a source for the whistleblower.\\n\\n-- Schiff, a mild-mannered former federal prosecutor, has emerged as a surprisingly polarizing figure. Perhaps it\\u2019s because the president has accused him of committing treason, in addition to calling him \\u201cpencil neck\\u201d and \\u201cliddle.\\u201d Trump has now tweeted about Schiff hundreds of times. Schiff\\u2019s boosters say the right only loathes him because he\\u2019s so effective.\\n\\n-- The president\\u2019s allies at Fox News have elevated Schiff this week into perhaps the biggest boogeyman for their audience. Arguably he\\u2019s a bigger target of their vitriol right now than Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders or even the four minority women in the Squad. If you\\u2019ve watched the network for even a few minutes this week, especially in primetime, you\\u2019ve probably seen hosts and guests attacking the man from Burbank.\\n\\nTucker Carlson continued his mockery last night of the man he\\u2019s taken to calling \\u201cSaint Adam,\\u201d a nickname intended to convey what he portrays as the congressman\\u2019s sanctimoniousness. \\u201cSay what you will, but as a piece of theater, it had literally everything,\\u201d Carlson said after playing a video clip of Schiff talking on the Senate floor about how Trump\\u2019s approach to Ukraine has played into Russian President Vladimir Putin\\u2019s hands.\\n\\n\\u201cThey accused us of doing nefarious things with this Lev Parnas character,\\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told Sean Hannity. \\u201cThe truth is Adam Schiff and the Democrats have been doing nefarious things with Parnas!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAdam's ordinarily not that stupid, but when you tell the jury, the Senate, on one day that they're corrupt, and then you tell the American people they cannot be trusted to pick the commander in chief, that's just a wildly stupid trial strategy,\\u201d former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told Bret Baier.\\n\\n-- Rudy Giuliani appeared on \\u201cFox & Friends\\u201d this morning to attack the Democratic managers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a complete show on the part of the Democrats, and they should be sued for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and they should pay for that hearing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to present over the next two to three weeks shocking crimes at the highest levels of both governments while the Senate is listening to a totally phony group of stories about non-impeachable offenses.\\u201d\\n\\nGiuliani has been promising for a while now to release said evidence. It has not been forthcoming, so take such claims with more than a grain of salt. The president\\u2019s lawyer also said for months that he was going to release a lengthy report rebutting former special counsel Bob Mueller\\u2019s findings on Russian interference and whether Trump obstructed justice. He never did.\\n\\n-- Meanwhile, thought leaders on the left have effusively praised Schiff's performance. Esquire\\u2019s Charlie Pierce calls Schiff the Daniel Webster of our time. Walter Dellinger, who was acting U.S. solicitor general under Bill Clinton, said Schiff offered \\u201cone of the most impressive performances by a lawyer I have ever seen.\\u201d MSNBC legal commentator Jason Johnson called Schiff\\u2019s opening statement on Wednesday \\u201ca speech that kids will be giving in 2060 at university projects.\\u201d Actress and activist Alyssa Milano, who has been attending the trial, said \\u201cit felt like you were watching a one-man show on Broadway.\\u201d\\n\\nStephen Colbert offered an early valentine to Schiff during his show. \\u201cIt was gratifying to see someone taking the constitutional responsibility of their office seriously,\\u201d the comedian told his viewers on CBS. Breaking out of character, he said that Schiff spoke \\u201cclearly, passionately, cogently, and, I believe, courageously.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Schiff \\u201cwell spoken\\u201d and said \\u201cdid a good job of creating a tapestry.\\u201d But other Republican senators have told reporters that Schiff was overly \\u201csmooth\\u201d or \\u201cslick,\\u201d which they meant as negatives. \\u201cIn a way I do feel like I\\u2019m introducing myself to a number of the senators,\\u201d Schiff told the Associated Press, adding that they\\u2019re \\u201cfinding I\\u2019m not the demon that I\\u2019m portrayed as on Fox.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope that four Republicans still might be persuaded to vote for witnesses. \\u201cJust about every Republican\\u2019s eyes were glued on Mr. Schiff,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a powerful rendition.\\u201d\\n\\n-- All eyes are on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). \\u201cPrivately, senior Senate Republicans expect the vote to seek witness testimony to fail, but they are watching Alexander and several other Republicans closely. And wherever Alexander comes down is almost sure to be the majority position in the Senate,\\u201d Politico reports. \\u201cHe's a retiring defender of the Senate as an institution who's occasionally bucked his party, but he also counts Mitch McConnell as a longtime ally. He's more hesitant to criticize Trump than are some other Republicans, but he also has said it was \\u2018inappropriate\\u2019 for Trump to ask foreign governments to investigate his political opponents. \\u2026 [Democrats] are holding out hope that Alexander will be their hero in the mold of the late Sen. John McCain, whose extraordinary vote derailed the GOP\\u2019s effort to repeal Obamacare.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump is keeping his distance from the Republicans who might vote to call witnesses after White House advisers warned the president that outreach wouldn\\u2019t help his cause. Democrats are also giving them space. Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report: \\u201cDemocrats say there is no serious effort to privately lobby the Republicans, with the party relying instead on public opinion and the House prosecutors to squeeze them into breaking ranks.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) played with blue and purple fidget spinners. These are popular toys for children. In contrast, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who will potentially cast decisive votes on witnesses, almost never moved from their second-row desks. \\u201cCollins is a furious note taker, while Murkowski just stares intensely at the speaker,\\u201d Paul Kane reports.\\n\\n-- Collins sent a handwritten note to Roberts before his admonishment of the lawyers for both sides in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The senior senator for Maine, facing a tough reelection fight, told WCSH-TV in her state that the debate had become \\u201ctoo personal,\\u201d and she said she got mad when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Senate Republicans of being part of a coverup. \\u201cI had heard both sides impugn the integrity of one another and also cast aspersions on the Senate,\\u201d Collins said. \\u201cThat is just not appropriate.\\u201d Collins said she\\u2019s undecided on witnesses but added that the Nadler comments won\\u2019t affect her decision.\\n\\n-- Fresh polling shows most Americans overwhelmingly think witnesses should testify. An AP-NORC poll shows that 7 in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his top aides to appear before the Senate, including most Republicans. The same survey found that 45 percent think Trump should be convicted, 40 percent said he should not be and 14 percent said they don\\u2019t know enough to have an opinion.\\n\\n-- But, but, but: \\u201cMitch McConnell doesn\\u2019t care what you think,\\u201d Ben Terris writes in a new profile of the majority leader. \\u201cHe just wants to win.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A growing number of Republican senators are pointing to Trump's threat to invoke executive privilege as an excuse to vote against even trying to call witnesses, CNN reports: \\u201cGOP senators are privately and publicly raising concerns that issuing subpoenas -- to top officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton and for documents blocked by the White House -- will only serve to drag out the proceedings. Plus, many say there's little appetite for such a time-consuming fight, given that legal battles may ultimately not be successful and could force the courts to rule on hugely consequential constitutional issues about the separation of powers between the branches of government.\\u201d\\n\\nMORE FROM THE TRIAL:\\n\\n-- Democrats used a significant chunk of time on Thursday to preemptively defend the Bidens, who they expect Trump\\u2019s lawyers to attack when they get the floor: \\u201cRep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine,\\u201d Seung Min Kim, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. \\u201cBut Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump\\u2019s defense team. \\u2026 Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn\\u2019t focus on Biden\\u2019s actions toward Ukraine until 2019 \\u2026 She also referenced a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \\u2026 and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden\\u2019s desire to see [prosecutor Viktor] Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy \\u2026 As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cBefore the trial officially began Thursday afternoon, dozens of senators from both parties entered a secure facility in the Senate basement to view a classified document provided by Jennifer Williams, a national security adviser to Vice President Pence. \\u2026 The document had been previously submitted to the House Intelligence Committee. Some senators spent only a few minutes in the facility; others stayed for the better part of an hour. Several Democrats emerged to say they didn\\u2019t understand why the document had been classified. \\u2018I don\\u2019t believe it\\u2019s being withheld from the public for national security reasons. It may be withheld for political security reasons,\\u2019 said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).\\u201d\\n\\n-- The favorite talking point for most Senate Republicans continues to be that they\\u2019re learning nothing new because House managers are repeating themselves. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters during last night\\u2019s dinner break that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day in the Senate.\\u201d Ironically, he had repeated throughout the day that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day.\\u201d He said the same thing to CNN in the morning.\\n\\n\\u201cFor them to say they\\u2019re bored, it has a lot to do with them not wanting to hear evidence,\\u201d countered Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \\u201cThey don\\u2019t want to hear that this president who they\\u2019re so busy supporting did these things. As I put it, the truth hurts.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Tomorrow\\u2019s timing: Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) tells reporters that Saturday\\u2019s session will likely start and end earlier than the past few days. Party leaders are still trying to negotiate a deal to start the day as early as 8 a.m. so they can wrap up by noon. This would allow Democratic presidential candidates to fly to Iowa for campaign events. The trial has started at 1 p.m. during the week so that Chief Justice John Roberts can participate in pre-scheduled Supreme Court oral arguments before crossing the street to preside over the trial in the Capitol.\\n\\n-- Pelosi may be half a world away from the Senate floor, but that doesn\\u2019t mean the speaker doesn\\u2019t have the trial under control. From the Times: \\u201cEven in her absence from the Capitol this week, as the speaker traveled through Poland and Israel \\u2026 she had her hand firmly on the tiller. \\u2026 In many ways, Ms. Pelosi is the eighth, largely unseen manager of the Democrats\\u2019 case. \\u2026 Ms. Pelosi has dispatched her handpicked House general counsel to sit at the table inside the Senate chamber, with the prosecutors acting as her eyes and ears. She reviewed all the managers\\u2019 written briefs before they were filed.\\\"\\n\\n-- A core argument from Democrats yesterday was that the framers didn\\u2019t believe a president needed to break the law in order to warrant impeachment. \\u201cThe Constitution is not a suicide pact,\\u201d said Nadler, one of the managers. \\u201cIt does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The House\\u2019s lawyers filed a motion with an appeals court last night that says Trump\\u2019s defense lawyers have contradicted, and therefore undermined, the Department of Justice\\u2019s position on subpoenas. Ann Marimow reports: \\u201cThe lawyers for [Pelosi] asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to rule quickly on the pair of separation-of-powers cases, which they said could affect the Senate proceedings. House Democrats went to court seeking testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn and access to secret grand jury evidence from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\\u2019s Russia investigation. Justice Department attorneys have urged the appeals court to stay out of what they say are political disputes between Congress and the White House.\\u201d But the president\\u2019s team is now telling the Senate that these are matters more properly left to the courts.\\n\\n-- The White House also stonewalled the Government Accountability Office when the independent congressional watchdog requested information about the freeze on Ukraine aid. From Politico: \\u201cThe White House responded to the [GAO\\u2019s] inquiry with a one-page letter on Dec. 20, citing a legal memo from the Office of Management and Budget that defended the hold on military aid as necessary to ensure spending the funds wouldn't \\u2018conflict with the President's foreign policy.\\u2019 \\u2026 The correspondence is part of what led GAO to \\u2026 conclude last week that Trump's decision to withhold military aid violated federal law.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Follow the money: The documents turned over by Lev Parnas, Giuliani\\u2019s former associate, provide details about the web of dark money that helped fund Trump\\u2019s Ukrainian gambit. From Bloomberg News: \\u201cMoney flowed to Giuliani and his cohorts from home loans, friends, relative strangers and wealthy businessmen, some with interests in the gas and energy sector. It even came from a lawyer for an embattled Ukrainian energy tycoon fighting extradition to the U.S. on a conspiracy charge. \\u2026 The travel arrangements could brush up against campaign finance laws. While Giuliani [and Parnas] can volunteer as much of their time as they want for a campaign, any subsidy for such work by third parties would generally need to be reported as a contribution, and money from foreign individuals would be illegal.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dana Milbank: \\\"John Roberts comes face to face with the mess he made.\\\"\\n\\u2022 Ruth Marcus: \\u201cA more assertive John Roberts would be a bad idea.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Brenda Wineapple, author of a book on Andrew Johnson\\u2019s impeachment: \\u201cIf John Roberts is seeking a role model, let\\u2019s hope it\\u2019s not Salmon Chase.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Michael Gerson: \\u201cRepublicans aren\\u2019t serving the country, or even the president.

Sarah Ellison reports: \\u201cPouring attention on regional talk-radio hosts is a classic Trumpworld move: giving relatively unknown characters proximity to the White House has paid off with a disproportionate amount of attention and praise lavished on the president and his agenda. \\u2026 The strategy has been particularly powerful as Trump and his team have engaged in what [Steve] Bannon calls \\u2018information warfare\\u2019 over the impeachment fight...\\u201d\\n\\n-- Kamala \\\"that-little-girl-was-me\\\" Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joe Biden to boost her standing in the veepstakes. From the New York Times: \\u201cSuch a move could lift Mr. Biden\\u2019s campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris\\u2019s chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California. An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial \\u2026 She and [Biden] have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Anita Hill told an Iowa crowd last night that it\\u2019s too late for Biden to apologize for the way he mistreated and diminished her when she testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991. \\u201cThe statute of limitations for his apology is up,\\u201d Hill said in response to a question from the audience at the University of Iowa, where she gave a lecture on ending sexual harassment. \\u201cWhat are you going to do about it?

Sean Sullivan reports: \\u201cCampaign officials have been pressing surrogates and other allies not to escalate combustible disputes that have recently become more personal, ... including a tense fight with Joe Biden, a separate altercation with [Elizabeth Warren] and a renewed schism with Hillary Clinton. \\u2026 But many Sanders supporters, and even some campaign aides, are inclined to take a more aggressive approach that they say will highlight important differences. \\u2026 Some close Sanders allies acknowledged the difficulty of balancing the passions of his loyal backers, inspired by his calls for a political revolution and his staunchly liberal platform, with the need to demonstrate a broader unity.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sanders\\u2019s rise in the polls means he\\u2019ll be talking more about his electability than a revolution. While speeches he\\u2019s made over the past two weeks still feature his signature call to action, he\\u2019s spending more time explaining to voters how policies like Medicare-for-all would work in their daily lives, as well as how he could beat Trump. (Bloomberg News)\\n\\n-- One in five women doubt that a woman can win the presidency, according to a new CNN poll. What\\u2019s telling about this news is that just 9 percent of men said the same. (Eugene Scott)\\n\\n-- Mike Bloomberg may be lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, but he\\u2019s attracted the president\\u2019s obsessive attention by baiting him with constant attack ads. Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer report: \\u201cThe president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him \\u2018Mini Mike\\u2019 to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials. \\u2018It\\u2019s very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,\\u2019 said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide \\u2026 Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. \\u2026 Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on \\u2018Fox & Friends\\u2019 on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as \\u2018dopes and babies.\\u2019 Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Former top supporters of Cory Booker accused Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s campaign of \\u201cchasing ambulances.\\u201d From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cThe phone calls to Amy Nielsen came around two hours apart. It was last Monday around 12 p.m., not long after the news broke, when her phone lit up with his name. By then, Nielsen considered Cory Booker \\u2018part of [her] family.\\u2019 \\u2026 So the end of his campaign felt \\u2026 like \\u2018a death.\\u2019 \\u2026 The next call came around 2:30 p.m., this time from an unknown number. It was Pete Buttigieg, calling to seek Nielsen\\u2019s support now that her candidate had made the decision to \\u2018step aside.\\u2019 \\u2026 \\u2018It was a gut punch \\u2014 like, really? He did not \\u2018step aside\\u2019 for you,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Like, wow, that\\u2019s some nerve right there.\\u2019 Later that night, she said, Nielsen heard from one of Booker\\u2019s field organizers who said she had already been contacted by the Buttigieg campaign to go door-knock.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Twelve years ago, Buttigieg spent the final week before the 2008 caucuses in rural southwest Iowa, trying to turn out voters for Barack Obama in one of the most conservative towns in the state. Holly Bailey spoke with him about what he learned: \\u201c\\u2018This was a new experience to really talk to people like this,\\u2019 Buttigieg recalled. \\u2018And what I found was, first of all, you can\\u2019t assume where somebody is going to be. We were in an area where a lot of people weren\\u2019t Democrats to begin with, and those who were were more likely to be for [John] Edwards. But they would hear us out when we were talking about Obama. And sometimes, as you do when you go door-to-door, somebody, because you represent a presidential campaign, would just pour out everything that was on their mind, everything they were upset about.\\\"\\n\\n\\u00ad-- Early voting means that millions are already eligible to cast their ballot. From the AP: \\u201cIn Minnesota, in-person early voting began Jan. 17. Vermont\\u2019s deadline to mail out its absentee ballots was the same day. Many of the 14 Super Tuesday states will offer some form of early voting between now and mid-February.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Howard County saw a bigger swing from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 than any other in Iowa. The Wall Street Journal's John McCormick took the pulse for 2020: \\u201cRecent interviews with dozens of voters here suggest that most of Mr. Trump\\u2019s 2016 supporters ... plan to stick with him, even though some said they have grown weary of his personal behavior and trade fights. Among those who previously voted for Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, many said they are reserving judgment until they see who wins the Democratic nomination. \\u2026 What such swing voters do in 2020 will have national implications. Before Mr. Trump, Howard County hadn\\u2019t backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. It is one of the 31 counties in Iowa\\u2014the most of any state\\u2014that backed Mr. Obama twice and then switched to Mr. Trump. The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A new Iowa caucus app is sparking election security concerns. From NBC News: \\u201cThe app will be used in Iowa and Nevada by caucus managers \\u2014 local registered Democrats who sign up to organize and run the caucus process in each location \\u2014 to expedite the process, calculate and assign delegates and report results back quickly. The app will also be used in satellite voting locations across the country and overseas. But questions about the app remain unanswered, including who developed it and whether it has been subjected to independent security testing. Security experts say that the app is a potential target for early election interference, particularly since it is downloaded on to the personal phones of the caucus managers. Party officials say operational security prevents them from disclosing specifics about the app.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Big-money groups aligned with the Senate GOP raised $68.3 million in 2019, an off-year record. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \\u201cThe majority of the money raised in 2019 came in the latter half of the year, particularly in the final two months, largely driven by the House Democrats\\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The ranks of scientists are growing thin in the Trump administration. Annie Gowen, Juliet Eilperin, Ben Guarino and Andrew Ba Tran report: \\u201cDozens of government computers sit in a nondescript building [in Kansas City, Mo.], able to connect to a data model that could help farmers manage the impact of a changing climate on their crops. But no one in this federal agency would know how to access the model, or, if they did, what to do with the data. That\\u2019s because the ambitious federal researcher who created it in Washington quit rather than move when the Agriculture Department relocated his agency to an office park here last fall. He is one of hundreds of scientists across the federal government who have been forced out, sidelined or muted since President Trump took office. \\u2026 In the first two years of the Trump administration, more than 1,600 federal scientists left government, according to Office of Personnel Management employment data \\u2026 That represents a 1.5 percent drop, compared with the 8 percent increase during the same period in the Obama administration.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Justice Department conceded that it had \\u201cinsufficient\\u201d cause to continue monitoring a former Trump campaign adviser during the Russia probe. Matt Zapotosky reports: \\u201cThe concession was revealed in an order posted on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\\u2019s website. In December, according to the order, the department told the court it had come to believe that in at least two of the four applications to monitor the former adviser, Carter Page, \\u2018there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause\\u2019 to believe he was acting as a Russian agent.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Trump administration will create additional new hurdles for pregnant foreign women seeking U.S. tourist visas. The administration said it's trying to crack down on what it calls \\u201cbirth tourism,\\\" trying to reduce what conservatives call \\\"anchor babies,\\\" by instructing consular officers to assess whether women requesting tourist visas are hoping to give birth on U.S. soil, which would effectively grant their children American citizenship. Starting today, the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor visas to women hoping to travel to the country with the stated purpose of having a child. Foggy Bottom said consular officers cannot require pregnancy tests to make the determination but wouldn\\u2019t rule out a woman\\u2019s physical appearance when making the decision, per Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti.\\n\\n-- Trump's \\\"national public health emergency\\\" declaration on the opioid crisis expired because his people at the Department of Health and Human Services forgot to renew it. An HHS spokesperson said the nine-day lapse had been corrected and blamed a clerical error. The emergency status, first announced in 2017 as a measure deemed necessary to direct more resources toward the drug overdose crisis, needs to be renewed every 90 days.

I was just trying to get him away from me, and he took my hands and put them over my head,\\u2019 Sciorra told the jury in Weinstein\\u2019s sexual assault trial, her eyes welling up with tears and her voice breaking. \\u2026 Weinstein, who had been watching her from the defense table, turned his gaze away from his accuser as she emotionally detailed the encounter. \\u2026 In her five hours of testimony, she described freezing after the attack, adding that \\u2018It was just so disgusting that my body started to shake.\\u2019 She said she had no romantic interest in Weinstein.

But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies. Adding to the stress, Friday marked the official start of \\u2026 when China celebrates the arrival of the new lunar year. Authorities around the country, including in the capital Beijing, have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the holiday to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could be spread. \\u2026The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was already entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice. Production companies have postponed the release of seven blockbuster films that were to be released over the holiday, leading Chinese cinema companies to close the country\\u2019s 70,000 movie theaters. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cThe National Health Commission reported Friday that there are now more than 830 confirmed cases of infection, and reports of new cases continued to roll in from around the country: from Xinjiang in the west to Shandong in the east, from Inner Mongolia in the north to Hainan in the south. A total of 8,420 were reported to be under observation. South Korean authorities confirmed Friday that a second person tested positive for the new coronavirus. \\u2026 Japan also confirmed a second case, a man in his 40s from Wuhan who arrived in Japan on Sunday on a flight through Hong Kong. Other countries to have reported infections including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to a confirmed case in Washington state, Texas has reported a potential case of coronavirus in Brazos County, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The patient contracted a respiratory illness within two weeks of traveling in Wuhan and is being isolated at home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\\n\\n\\u201cSome details about the latest deaths in China have raised concerns about the virus\\u2019s spread. Until now, the vast majority of the people had been older than 60 and almost all of them had existing health conditions. All of them had been in Hubei province \\u2026 But the latest announcement said that 36-year-old man from Wuhan, identified only by his family name, Li, died on Thursday. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions, and had been treated with anti-virus medication and antibiotics since being admitted to a hospital on Jan. 9.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Wall Street stumbled yesterday amid fears that efforts to curtail the virus could further disrupt the global economy.

(Meagan Flynn)\\n\\n-- Trump\\u2019s sanctions on Iran are fueling a new refugee crisis \\u2013 in Turkey. Erin Cunningham and Mohammad Mahdi Sultani report: \\u201cDecades ago, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted thousands of people to flee to neighboring Iran. Now, many of these refugees are once again seeking a new home in a new land, Turkey, desperate to escape the dire economic conditions fueled by U.S. sanctions on Tehran. \\u2026 Turkish authorities are grappling with nearly 4 million refugees. This is the world\\u2019s largest population of displaced people, according to the United Nations, including more than 170,000 registered Afghan refugees. Turkey has struggled to contain the influx even as aid agencies say the number of arrivals from Iran is on the rise.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A critic of the Saudi Arabian government said a suspected Saudi agent tried to kidnap him on U.S. soil, a claim backed up by multiple U.S. and foreign sources familiar with the episode. From the Daily Beast: \\u201cAbdulrahman Almutairi is a 27-year-old comedian and former student at the University of San Diego with a big social-media presence. After Almutairi used social media to criticize the powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman over the October 2018 murder and dismemberment of Washington Post contributor [Jamal] Khashoggi, an unidentified Saudi man accompanied Almutairi\\u2019s father on a flight to collect Almutairi against his will and bring him back to Saudi Arabia...\\\"\\n\\n-- The Trump administration has missed the deadline, established by law, to turn over to Congress an unclassified report on Khashoggi's murder and the role played by the regime in Riyadh. From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cIn December, lawmakers passed a sweeping defense bill that included a provision ordering the director of national intelligence to send Congress an unclassified report identifying those responsible for Khashoggi\\u2019s death at a Saudi Arabian consulate in 2018. The legislation set the deadline for the report at 30 days, which passed earlier this week.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A small team of FBI agents spent years trying to solve a stubborn mystery \\u2013 whether officials from Saudi Arabia were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. A team of ProPublica and NYT Magazine reporters tell their story: \\u201cThe FBI has disputed the idea that foreign-policy considerations significantly influenced its investigation. In interviews, current and former bureau officials and federal prosecutors insisted to us that they never would have hesitated to pursue any Saudi who could have been solidly linked to the 9/11 plot \\u2026 But others who worked on the matter, including some at the FBI\\u2019s highest levels, say that the United States\\u2019 complex and often-troubled relationship with the Saudi regime was an unavoidable fact throughout their investigations. Even as the Saudi authorities became more cooperative with the United States in fighting al-Qaida after 2003, they were minimally and grudgingly helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry. According to current and former officials, requests for assistance that might rattle the Saudi security agencies were frequently balanced against FBI and CIA needs for Saudi help against continuing terror threats.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival, Benny Gantz, next week to discuss his Middle East peace plan.

You can trust that he will do what\\u2019s right for Donald Trump. He\\u2019ll do it now. He\\u2019ll do it for the next several months. He\\u2019ll do it in the election if he\\u2019s allowed to. This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Democrat from California has repeatedly praised Vindman and others for \\u201csticking their necks out\\u201d to answer questions about the president\\u2019s alleged Ukraine coercion campaign when his former bosses, including ex-national security adviser John Bolton, refused to come before the House. \\u201cI have such admiration for the fact they did,\\u201d Schiff said on Wednesday. \\u201cBut what would really vindicate that leap of faith \\u2026 is if we show the same courage. They risked everything\\u2014their careers\\u2014and, yes, I know what you are asked to decide may risk yours too, but if they could show the courage, so can we.\\u201d\\n\\nOver the course of several hours earlier in the afternoon, Schiff had laid out 10 separate arguments for why Trump\\u2019s push to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden was intended for the president\\u2019s personal benefit and not to advance the national interest. \\u201cWhen we\\u2019re done, we believe that we will have made the case overwhelmingly that the president is guilty,\\u201d Schiff said. \\u201cIs there really any doubt about this? I mean, do we really have any doubt about the facts here? Does anybody really question whether the president is capable of what he\\u2019s charged with? No one is really making the argument Donald Trump would never do such a thing \\u2026 because, of course, we know that he would.\\u201d\\n\\nVindman remains assigned to the White House, something that has drawn the continuing ire of pro-Trump commentators. Schiff thanked senators last night for \\u201ckeeping an open mind about all of the issues we are presenting.\\u201d But, after Schiff spoke, Senate Republican leaders privately expressed growing confidence that they can win the vote next week to block additional witnesses from being summoned to testify. It\\u2019s not clear whether Schiff\\u2019s calls for courage have pushed any Republican senators toward breaking with the president and their party leaders on the key votes coming up next week surrounding summoning witnesses or subpoenaing documents.\\n\\n-- Schiff spoke a few hours after Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), one of the jurors, questioned Vindman\\u2019s patriotism by propagating an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory from the fever swamps of the dark corners of the pro-Trump fringe Internet. Blackburn claimed that Vindman once badmouthed the United States to Russians while serving overseas. \\u201cAdam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot,\\u201d she tweeted. \\u201cHow patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America\\u2019s greatest enemy?\\u201d\\n\\nVindman\\u2019s lawyer, former ambassador David Pressman, accused Blackburn of defaming his client. \\u201cThat a member of the Senate \\u2014 at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility \\u2014 would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice,\\u201d Pressman emailed. \\u201cWhile Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\\u201d\\n\\nBlackburn isn\\u2019t backing down and tweeted another attack around 8 p.m. Trump himself retweeted her this morning. The senator, who won Bob Corker's seat after he retired in 2018, has also accused Vindman of being a \\u201chandler\\u201d for the whistleblower who filed the complaint. Vindman testified before Schiff\\u2019s committee that he spoke with an intelligence community official about Trump\\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he declined to identify the official on the advice of counsel because he said he didn\\u2019t want to blow someone\\u2019s cover. But no public evidence exists that he was a source for the whistleblower.\\n\\n-- Schiff, a mild-mannered former federal prosecutor, has emerged as a surprisingly polarizing figure. Perhaps it\\u2019s because the president has accused him of committing treason, in addition to calling him \\u201cpencil neck\\u201d and \\u201cliddle.\\u201d Trump has now tweeted about Schiff hundreds of times. Schiff\\u2019s boosters say the right only loathes him because he\\u2019s so effective.\\n\\n-- The president\\u2019s allies at Fox News have elevated Schiff this week into perhaps the biggest boogeyman for their audience. Arguably he\\u2019s a bigger target of their vitriol right now than Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders or even the four minority women in the Squad. If you\\u2019ve watched the network for even a few minutes this week, especially in primetime, you\\u2019ve probably seen hosts and guests attacking the man from Burbank.\\n\\nTucker Carlson continued his mockery last night of the man he\\u2019s taken to calling \\u201cSaint Adam,\\u201d a nickname intended to convey what he portrays as the congressman\\u2019s sanctimoniousness. \\u201cSay what you will, but as a piece of theater, it had literally everything,\\u201d Carlson said after playing a video clip of Schiff talking on the Senate floor about how Trump\\u2019s approach to Ukraine has played into Russian President Vladimir Putin\\u2019s hands.\\n\\n\\u201cThey accused us of doing nefarious things with this Lev Parnas character,\\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told Sean Hannity. \\u201cThe truth is Adam Schiff and the Democrats have been doing nefarious things with Parnas!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAdam's ordinarily not that stupid, but when you tell the jury, the Senate, on one day that they're corrupt, and then you tell the American people they cannot be trusted to pick the commander in chief, that's just a wildly stupid trial strategy,\\u201d former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told Bret Baier.\\n\\n-- Rudy Giuliani appeared on \\u201cFox & Friends\\u201d this morning to attack the Democratic managers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a complete show on the part of the Democrats, and they should be sued for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and they should pay for that hearing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to present over the next two to three weeks shocking crimes at the highest levels of both governments while the Senate is listening to a totally phony group of stories about non-impeachable offenses.\\u201d\\n\\nGiuliani has been promising for a while now to release said evidence. It has not been forthcoming, so take such claims with more than a grain of salt. The president\\u2019s lawyer also said for months that he was going to release a lengthy report rebutting former special counsel Bob Mueller\\u2019s findings on Russian interference and whether Trump obstructed justice. He never did.\\n\\n-- Meanwhile, thought leaders on the left have effusively praised Schiff's performance. Esquire\\u2019s Charlie Pierce calls Schiff the Daniel Webster of our time. Walter Dellinger, who was acting U.S. solicitor general under Bill Clinton, said Schiff offered \\u201cone of the most impressive performances by a lawyer I have ever seen.\\u201d MSNBC legal commentator Jason Johnson called Schiff\\u2019s opening statement on Wednesday \\u201ca speech that kids will be giving in 2060 at university projects.\\u201d Actress and activist Alyssa Milano, who has been attending the trial, said \\u201cit felt like you were watching a one-man show on Broadway.\\u201d\\n\\nStephen Colbert offered an early valentine to Schiff during his show. \\u201cIt was gratifying to see someone taking the constitutional responsibility of their office seriously,\\u201d the comedian told his viewers on CBS. Breaking out of character, he said that Schiff spoke \\u201cclearly, passionately, cogently, and, I believe, courageously.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Schiff \\u201cwell spoken\\u201d and said \\u201cdid a good job of creating a tapestry.\\u201d But other Republican senators have told reporters that Schiff was overly \\u201csmooth\\u201d or \\u201cslick,\\u201d which they meant as negatives. \\u201cIn a way I do feel like I\\u2019m introducing myself to a number of the senators,\\u201d Schiff told the Associated Press, adding that they\\u2019re \\u201cfinding I\\u2019m not the demon that I\\u2019m portrayed as on Fox.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope that four Republicans still might be persuaded to vote for witnesses. \\u201cJust about every Republican\\u2019s eyes were glued on Mr. Schiff,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a powerful rendition.\\u201d\\n\\n-- All eyes are on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). \\u201cPrivately, senior Senate Republicans expect the vote to seek witness testimony to fail, but they are watching Alexander and several other Republicans closely. And wherever Alexander comes down is almost sure to be the majority position in the Senate,\\u201d Politico reports. \\u201cHe's a retiring defender of the Senate as an institution who's occasionally bucked his party, but he also counts Mitch McConnell as a longtime ally. He's more hesitant to criticize Trump than are some other Republicans, but he also has said it was \\u2018inappropriate\\u2019 for Trump to ask foreign governments to investigate his political opponents. \\u2026 [Democrats] are holding out hope that Alexander will be their hero in the mold of the late Sen. John McCain, whose extraordinary vote derailed the GOP\\u2019s effort to repeal Obamacare.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump is keeping his distance from the Republicans who might vote to call witnesses after White House advisers warned the president that outreach wouldn\\u2019t help his cause. Democrats are also giving them space. Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report: \\u201cDemocrats say there is no serious effort to privately lobby the Republicans, with the party relying instead on public opinion and the House prosecutors to squeeze them into breaking ranks.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) played with blue and purple fidget spinners. These are popular toys for children. In contrast, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who will potentially cast decisive votes on witnesses, almost never moved from their second-row desks. \\u201cCollins is a furious note taker, while Murkowski just stares intensely at the speaker,\\u201d Paul Kane reports.\\n\\n-- Collins sent a handwritten note to Roberts before his admonishment of the lawyers for both sides in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The senior senator for Maine, facing a tough reelection fight, told WCSH-TV in her state that the debate had become \\u201ctoo personal,\\u201d and she said she got mad when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Senate Republicans of being part of a coverup. \\u201cI had heard both sides impugn the integrity of one another and also cast aspersions on the Senate,\\u201d Collins said. \\u201cThat is just not appropriate.\\u201d Collins said she\\u2019s undecided on witnesses but added that the Nadler comments won\\u2019t affect her decision.\\n\\n-- Fresh polling shows most Americans overwhelmingly think witnesses should testify. An AP-NORC poll shows that 7 in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his top aides to appear before the Senate, including most Republicans. The same survey found that 45 percent think Trump should be convicted, 40 percent said he should not be and 14 percent said they don\\u2019t know enough to have an opinion.\\n\\n-- But, but, but: \\u201cMitch McConnell doesn\\u2019t care what you think,\\u201d Ben Terris writes in a new profile of the majority leader. \\u201cHe just wants to win.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A growing number of Republican senators are pointing to Trump's threat to invoke executive privilege as an excuse to vote against even trying to call witnesses, CNN reports: \\u201cGOP senators are privately and publicly raising concerns that issuing subpoenas -- to top officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton and for documents blocked by the White House -- will only serve to drag out the proceedings. Plus, many say there's little appetite for such a time-consuming fight, given that legal battles may ultimately not be successful and could force the courts to rule on hugely consequential constitutional issues about the separation of powers between the branches of government.\\u201d\\n\\nMORE FROM THE TRIAL:\\n\\n-- Democrats used a significant chunk of time on Thursday to preemptively defend the Bidens, who they expect Trump\\u2019s lawyers to attack when they get the floor: \\u201cRep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine,\\u201d Seung Min Kim, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. \\u201cBut Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump\\u2019s defense team. \\u2026 Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn\\u2019t focus on Biden\\u2019s actions toward Ukraine until 2019 \\u2026 She also referenced a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \\u2026 and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden\\u2019s desire to see [prosecutor Viktor] Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy \\u2026 As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cBefore the trial officially began Thursday afternoon, dozens of senators from both parties entered a secure facility in the Senate basement to view a classified document provided by Jennifer Williams, a national security adviser to Vice President Pence. \\u2026 The document had been previously submitted to the House Intelligence Committee. Some senators spent only a few minutes in the facility; others stayed for the better part of an hour. Several Democrats emerged to say they didn\\u2019t understand why the document had been classified. \\u2018I don\\u2019t believe it\\u2019s being withheld from the public for national security reasons. It may be withheld for political security reasons,\\u2019 said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).\\u201d\\n\\n-- The favorite talking point for most Senate Republicans continues to be that they\\u2019re learning nothing new because House managers are repeating themselves. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters during last night\\u2019s dinner break that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day in the Senate.\\u201d Ironically, he had repeated throughout the day that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day.\\u201d He said the same thing to CNN in the morning.\\n\\n\\u201cFor them to say they\\u2019re bored, it has a lot to do with them not wanting to hear evidence,\\u201d countered Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \\u201cThey don\\u2019t want to hear that this president who they\\u2019re so busy supporting did these things. As I put it, the truth hurts.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Tomorrow\\u2019s timing: Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) tells reporters that Saturday\\u2019s session will likely start and end earlier than the past few days. Party leaders are still trying to negotiate a deal to start the day as early as 8 a.m. so they can wrap up by noon. This would allow Democratic presidential candidates to fly to Iowa for campaign events. The trial has started at 1 p.m. during the week so that Chief Justice John Roberts can participate in pre-scheduled Supreme Court oral arguments before crossing the street to preside over the trial in the Capitol.\\n\\n-- Pelosi may be half a world away from the Senate floor, but that doesn\\u2019t mean the speaker doesn\\u2019t have the trial under control. From the Times: \\u201cEven in her absence from the Capitol this week, as the speaker traveled through Poland and Israel \\u2026 she had her hand firmly on the tiller. \\u2026 In many ways, Ms. Pelosi is the eighth, largely unseen manager of the Democrats\\u2019 case. \\u2026 Ms. Pelosi has dispatched her handpicked House general counsel to sit at the table inside the Senate chamber, with the prosecutors acting as her eyes and ears. She reviewed all the managers\\u2019 written briefs before they were filed.\\\"\\n\\n-- A core argument from Democrats yesterday was that the framers didn\\u2019t believe a president needed to break the law in order to warrant impeachment. \\u201cThe Constitution is not a suicide pact,\\u201d said Nadler, one of the managers. \\u201cIt does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The House\\u2019s lawyers filed a motion with an appeals court last night that says Trump\\u2019s defense lawyers have contradicted, and therefore undermined, the Department of Justice\\u2019s position on subpoenas. Ann Marimow reports: \\u201cThe lawyers for [Pelosi] asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to rule quickly on the pair of separation-of-powers cases, which they said could affect the Senate proceedings. House Democrats went to court seeking testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn and access to secret grand jury evidence from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\\u2019s Russia investigation. Justice Department attorneys have urged the appeals court to stay out of what they say are political disputes between Congress and the White House.\\u201d But the president\\u2019s team is now telling the Senate that these are matters more properly left to the courts.\\n\\n-- The White House also stonewalled the Government Accountability Office when the independent congressional watchdog requested information about the freeze on Ukraine aid. From Politico: \\u201cThe White House responded to the [GAO\\u2019s] inquiry with a one-page letter on Dec. 20, citing a legal memo from the Office of Management and Budget that defended the hold on military aid as necessary to ensure spending the funds wouldn't \\u2018conflict with the President's foreign policy.\\u2019 \\u2026 The correspondence is part of what led GAO to \\u2026 conclude last week that Trump's decision to withhold military aid violated federal law.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Follow the money: The documents turned over by Lev Parnas, Giuliani\\u2019s former associate, provide details about the web of dark money that helped fund Trump\\u2019s Ukrainian gambit. From Bloomberg News: \\u201cMoney flowed to Giuliani and his cohorts from home loans, friends, relative strangers and wealthy businessmen, some with interests in the gas and energy sector. It even came from a lawyer for an embattled Ukrainian energy tycoon fighting extradition to the U.S. on a conspiracy charge. \\u2026 The travel arrangements could brush up against campaign finance laws. While Giuliani [and Parnas] can volunteer as much of their time as they want for a campaign, any subsidy for such work by third parties would generally need to be reported as a contribution, and money from foreign individuals would be illegal.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dana Milbank: \\\"John Roberts comes face to face with the mess he made.\\\"\\n\\u2022 Ruth Marcus: \\u201cA more assertive John Roberts would be a bad idea.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Brenda Wineapple, author of a book on Andrew Johnson\\u2019s impeachment: \\u201cIf John Roberts is seeking a role model, let\\u2019s hope it\\u2019s not Salmon Chase.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Michael Gerson: \\u201cRepublicans aren\\u2019t serving the country, or even the president. Just themselves.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Eugene Robinson: \\u201cSenate Republicans\\u2019 defense of Trump is as mushy as apple pie.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Garret Graff, founding director of the Aspen Institute\\u2019s Cyber & Technology Program: \\u201cTrump won\\u2019t protect our elections, so private companies are doing it.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dan Drezner: \\u201cWhen American political institutions give up: After three years of Trump, there have been some unhealthy adjustments.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Regional radio hosts across the country have found themselves showered with attention by senior Trump officials, who have made accessibility to local conservative talking heads a central part of the president\\u2019s reelection strategy. Sarah Ellison reports: \\u201cPouring attention on regional talk-radio hosts is a classic Trumpworld move: giving relatively unknown characters proximity to the White House has paid off with a disproportionate amount of attention and praise lavished on the president and his agenda. \\u2026 The strategy has been particularly powerful as Trump and his team have engaged in what [Steve] Bannon calls \\u2018information warfare\\u2019 over the impeachment fight...\\u201d\\n\\n-- Kamala \\\"that-little-girl-was-me\\\" Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joe Biden to boost her standing in the veepstakes. From the New York Times: \\u201cSuch a move could lift Mr. Biden\\u2019s campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris\\u2019s chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California. An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial \\u2026 She and [Biden] have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Anita Hill told an Iowa crowd last night that it\\u2019s too late for Biden to apologize for the way he mistreated and diminished her when she testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991. \\u201cThe statute of limitations for his apology is up,\\u201d Hill said in response to a question from the audience at the University of Iowa, where she gave a lecture on ending sexual harassment. \\u201cWhat are you going to do about it? What are you going to do today? Will you promise as leader of this country \\u2026 to use all of your energy to address the problem as it happened and to prevent it from happening to another generation? That\\u2019s what I want to hear. And I not only want to hear from him, I want to hear from every one of them who want to be the leader of this country.\\u201d (BuzzFeed News)\\n\\n-- Bernie Sanders asked his supporters to cool it \\u2013 but they don\\u2019t always listen. Sean Sullivan reports: \\u201cCampaign officials have been pressing surrogates and other allies not to escalate combustible disputes that have recently become more personal, ... including a tense fight with Joe Biden, a separate altercation with [Elizabeth Warren] and a renewed schism with Hillary Clinton. \\u2026 But many Sanders supporters, and even some campaign aides, are inclined to take a more aggressive approach that they say will highlight important differences. \\u2026 Some close Sanders allies acknowledged the difficulty of balancing the passions of his loyal backers, inspired by his calls for a political revolution and his staunchly liberal platform, with the need to demonstrate a broader unity.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sanders\\u2019s rise in the polls means he\\u2019ll be talking more about his electability than a revolution. While speeches he\\u2019s made over the past two weeks still feature his signature call to action, he\\u2019s spending more time explaining to voters how policies like Medicare-for-all would work in their daily lives, as well as how he could beat Trump. (Bloomberg News)\\n\\n-- One in five women doubt that a woman can win the presidency, according to a new CNN poll. What\\u2019s telling about this news is that just 9 percent of men said the same. (Eugene Scott)\\n\\n-- Mike Bloomberg may be lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, but he\\u2019s attracted the president\\u2019s obsessive attention by baiting him with constant attack ads. Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer report: \\u201cThe president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him \\u2018Mini Mike\\u2019 to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials. \\u2018It\\u2019s very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,\\u2019 said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide \\u2026 Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. \\u2026 Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on \\u2018Fox & Friends\\u2019 on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as \\u2018dopes and babies.\\u2019 Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Former top supporters of Cory Booker accused Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s campaign of \\u201cchasing ambulances.\\u201d From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cThe phone calls to Amy Nielsen came around two hours apart. It was last Monday around 12 p.m., not long after the news broke, when her phone lit up with his name. By then, Nielsen considered Cory Booker \\u2018part of [her] family.\\u2019 \\u2026 So the end of his campaign felt \\u2026 like \\u2018a death.\\u2019 \\u2026 The next call came around 2:30 p.m., this time from an unknown number. It was Pete Buttigieg, calling to seek Nielsen\\u2019s support now that her candidate had made the decision to \\u2018step aside.\\u2019 \\u2026 \\u2018It was a gut punch \\u2014 like, really? He did not \\u2018step aside\\u2019 for you,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Like, wow, that\\u2019s some nerve right there.\\u2019 Later that night, she said, Nielsen heard from one of Booker\\u2019s field organizers who said she had already been contacted by the Buttigieg campaign to go door-knock.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Twelve years ago, Buttigieg spent the final week before the 2008 caucuses in rural southwest Iowa, trying to turn out voters for Barack Obama in one of the most conservative towns in the state. Holly Bailey spoke with him about what he learned: \\u201c\\u2018This was a new experience to really talk to people like this,\\u2019 Buttigieg recalled. \\u2018And what I found was, first of all, you can\\u2019t assume where somebody is going to be. We were in an area where a lot of people weren\\u2019t Democrats to begin with, and those who were were more likely to be for [John] Edwards. But they would hear us out when we were talking about Obama. And sometimes, as you do when you go door-to-door, somebody, because you represent a presidential campaign, would just pour out everything that was on their mind, everything they were upset about.\\\"\\n\\n\\u00ad-- Early voting means that millions are already eligible to cast their ballot. From the AP: \\u201cIn Minnesota, in-person early voting began Jan. 17. Vermont\\u2019s deadline to mail out its absentee ballots was the same day. Many of the 14 Super Tuesday states will offer some form of early voting between now and mid-February.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Howard County saw a bigger swing from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 than any other in Iowa. The Wall Street Journal's John McCormick took the pulse for 2020: \\u201cRecent interviews with dozens of voters here suggest that most of Mr. Trump\\u2019s 2016 supporters ... plan to stick with him, even though some said they have grown weary of his personal behavior and trade fights. Among those who previously voted for Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, many said they are reserving judgment until they see who wins the Democratic nomination. \\u2026 What such swing voters do in 2020 will have national implications. Before Mr. Trump, Howard County hadn\\u2019t backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. It is one of the 31 counties in Iowa\\u2014the most of any state\\u2014that backed Mr. Obama twice and then switched to Mr. Trump. The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A new Iowa caucus app is sparking election security concerns. From NBC News: \\u201cThe app will be used in Iowa and Nevada by caucus managers \\u2014 local registered Democrats who sign up to organize and run the caucus process in each location \\u2014 to expedite the process, calculate and assign delegates and report results back quickly. The app will also be used in satellite voting locations across the country and overseas. But questions about the app remain unanswered, including who developed it and whether it has been subjected to independent security testing. Security experts say that the app is a potential target for early election interference, particularly since it is downloaded on to the personal phones of the caucus managers. Party officials say operational security prevents them from disclosing specifics about the app.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Big-money groups aligned with the Senate GOP raised $68.3 million in 2019, an off-year record. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \\u201cThe majority of the money raised in 2019 came in the latter half of the year, particularly in the final two months, largely driven by the House Democrats\\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The ranks of scientists are growing thin in the Trump administration. Annie Gowen, Juliet Eilperin, Ben Guarino and Andrew Ba Tran report: \\u201cDozens of government computers sit in a nondescript building [in Kansas City, Mo.], able to connect to a data model that could help farmers manage the impact of a changing climate on their crops. But no one in this federal agency would know how to access the model, or, if they did, what to do with the data. That\\u2019s because the ambitious federal researcher who created it in Washington quit rather than move when the Agriculture Department relocated his agency to an office park here last fall. He is one of hundreds of scientists across the federal government who have been forced out, sidelined or muted since President Trump took office. \\u2026 In the first two years of the Trump administration, more than 1,600 federal scientists left government, according to Office of Personnel Management employment data \\u2026 That represents a 1.5 percent drop, compared with the 8 percent increase during the same period in the Obama administration.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Justice Department conceded that it had \\u201cinsufficient\\u201d cause to continue monitoring a former Trump campaign adviser during the Russia probe. Matt Zapotosky reports: \\u201cThe concession was revealed in an order posted on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\\u2019s website. In December, according to the order, the department told the court it had come to believe that in at least two of the four applications to monitor the former adviser, Carter Page, \\u2018there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause\\u2019 to believe he was acting as a Russian agent.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Trump administration will create additional new hurdles for pregnant foreign women seeking U.S. tourist visas. The administration said it's trying to crack down on what it calls \\u201cbirth tourism,\\\" trying to reduce what conservatives call \\\"anchor babies,\\\" by instructing consular officers to assess whether women requesting tourist visas are hoping to give birth on U.S. soil, which would effectively grant their children American citizenship. Starting today, the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor visas to women hoping to travel to the country with the stated purpose of having a child. Foggy Bottom said consular officers cannot require pregnancy tests to make the determination but wouldn\\u2019t rule out a woman\\u2019s physical appearance when making the decision, per Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti.\\n\\n-- Trump's \\\"national public health emergency\\\" declaration on the opioid crisis expired because his people at the Department of Health and Human Services forgot to renew it. An HHS spokesperson said the nine-day lapse had been corrected and blamed a clerical error. The emergency status, first announced in 2017 as a measure deemed necessary to direct more resources toward the drug overdose crisis, needs to be renewed every 90 days. (Politico)\\n\\n-- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, 17, needs to study economics before offering her thoughts on climate change. Heather Long reports from Davos: \\u201cThunberg and Mnuchin are both attending the World Economic Forum this week. \\u2026 At a news conference on Thursday, Mnuchin was asked for his reaction to Thunberg\\u2019s insistence on fossil fuel divestment. \\u2018Who is she?\\u2019 he tried to joke to reporters before taking a jab at Thunberg, suggesting she didn\\u2019t understand what she was talking about. \\u2026 \\u2018Is she the chief economist or who is she?

Shayna Jacobs reports: \\u201c\\u2018I was punching him. I was kicking him. I was just trying to get him away from me, and he took my hands and put them over my head,\\u2019 Sciorra told the jury in Weinstein\\u2019s sexual assault trial, her eyes welling up with tears and her voice breaking. \\u2026 Weinstein, who had been watching her from the defense table, turned his gaze away from his accuser as she emotionally detailed the encounter. \\u2026 In her five hours of testimony, she described freezing after the attack, adding that \\u2018It was just so disgusting that my body started to shake.\\u2019 She said she had no romantic interest in Weinstein. The film producer arrived at her Manhattan apartment uninvited one night.\\u201d\\n\\n-- \\u201cA young, healthy man from Wuhan and a person living 1,500 miles from the epicenter of the coronavirus are among the latest victims of the outbreak, which has incited fear and anger across China as the important Spring Festival gets underway,\\u201d Anna Fifield reports from Beijing. \\u201cReports of eight new deaths from the pneumonia-like virus, taking the total to 26, came as authorities enforced a lockdown across large parts of the province of Hubei, population 59 million. But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies. Adding to the stress, Friday marked the official start of \\u2026 when China celebrates the arrival of the new lunar year. Authorities around the country, including in the capital Beijing, have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the holiday to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could be spread. \\u2026The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was already entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice. Production companies have postponed the release of seven blockbuster films that were to be released over the holiday, leading Chinese cinema companies to close the country\\u2019s 70,000 movie theaters. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cThe National Health Commission reported Friday that there are now more than 830 confirmed cases of infection, and reports of new cases continued to roll in from around the country: from Xinjiang in the west to Shandong in the east, from Inner Mongolia in the north to Hainan in the south. A total of 8,420 were reported to be under observation. South Korean authorities confirmed Friday that a second person tested positive for the new coronavirus. \\u2026 Japan also confirmed a second case, a man in his 40s from Wuhan who arrived in Japan on Sunday on a flight through Hong Kong. Other countries to have reported infections including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to a confirmed case in Washington state, Texas has reported a potential case of coronavirus in Brazos County, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The patient contracted a respiratory illness within two weeks of traveling in Wuhan and is being isolated at home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\\n\\n\\u201cSome details about the latest deaths in China have raised concerns about the virus\\u2019s spread. Until now, the vast majority of the people had been older than 60 and almost all of them had existing health conditions. All of them had been in Hubei province \\u2026 But the latest announcement said that 36-year-old man from Wuhan, identified only by his family name, Li, died on Thursday. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions, and had been treated with anti-virus medication and antibiotics since being admitted to a hospital on Jan. 9.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Wall Street stumbled yesterday amid fears that efforts to curtail the virus could further disrupt the global economy. (David Lynch)\\n\\n-- The U.S. has officially refused to extradite Anne Sacoolas, the diplomat\\u2019s wife who fled the U.K. to avoid facing charges for killing a British teen by driving on the wrong side of the road. A State Department spokesman said extraditing Sacoolas would \\u201cset an extraordinarily troubling precedent\\u201d but did not elaborate. (Meagan Flynn)\\n\\n-- Trump\\u2019s sanctions on Iran are fueling a new refugee crisis \\u2013 in Turkey. Erin Cunningham and Mohammad Mahdi Sultani report: \\u201cDecades ago, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted thousands of people to flee to neighboring Iran. Now, many of these refugees are once again seeking a new home in a new land, Turkey, desperate to escape the dire economic conditions fueled by U.S. sanctions on Tehran. \\u2026 Turkish authorities are grappling with nearly 4 million refugees. This is the world\\u2019s largest population of displaced people, according to the United Nations, including more than 170,000 registered Afghan refugees. Turkey has struggled to contain the influx even as aid agencies say the number of arrivals from Iran is on the rise.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A critic of the Saudi Arabian government said a suspected Saudi agent tried to kidnap him on U.S. soil, a claim backed up by multiple U.S. and foreign sources familiar with the episode. From the Daily Beast: \\u201cAbdulrahman Almutairi is a 27-year-old comedian and former student at the University of San Diego with a big social-media presence. After Almutairi used social media to criticize the powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman over the October 2018 murder and dismemberment of Washington Post contributor [Jamal] Khashoggi, an unidentified Saudi man accompanied Almutairi\\u2019s father on a flight to collect Almutairi against his will and bring him back to Saudi Arabia...\\\"\\n\\n-- The Trump administration has missed the deadline, established by law, to turn over to Congress an unclassified report on Khashoggi's murder and the role played by the regime in Riyadh. From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cIn December, lawmakers passed a sweeping defense bill that included a provision ordering the director of national intelligence to send Congress an unclassified report identifying those responsible for Khashoggi\\u2019s death at a Saudi Arabian consulate in 2018. The legislation set the deadline for the report at 30 days, which passed earlier this week.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A small team of FBI agents spent years trying to solve a stubborn mystery \\u2013 whether officials from Saudi Arabia were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. A team of ProPublica and NYT Magazine reporters tell their story: \\u201cThe FBI has disputed the idea that foreign-policy considerations significantly influenced its investigation. In interviews, current and former bureau officials and federal prosecutors insisted to us that they never would have hesitated to pursue any Saudi who could have been solidly linked to the 9/11 plot \\u2026 But others who worked on the matter, including some at the FBI\\u2019s highest levels, say that the United States\\u2019 complex and often-troubled relationship with the Saudi regime was an unavoidable fact throughout their investigations. Even as the Saudi authorities became more cooperative with the United States in fighting al-Qaida after 2003, they were minimally and grudgingly helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry. According to current and former officials, requests for assistance that might rattle the Saudi security agencies were frequently balanced against FBI and CIA needs for Saudi help against continuing terror threats.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival, Benny Gantz, next week to discuss his Middle East peace plan. The meeting comes amid Trump\\u2019s trial, as well as Netanyahu and Gantz\\u2019s own troubles at home, where they\\u2019ve both failed to form a government.

Col. Alexander Vindman as the model of courage that Senate Republicans should follow during President Trump's trial.\\n\\nThe House Intelligence chairman fought back emotion late last night as he recalled Vindman\\u2019s November appearance before his committee. Vindman was born in the Soviet Union, but his father brought him here when he was a young boy. The director of European Affairs on the National Security Council, who received a Purple Heart after he was injured in Iraq, said that his father worried when he told him he would testify. But he reassured him. \\u201cThis is America,\\u201d Vindman recalled telling his dad. \\u201cHere, right matters.\\u201d The audience broke into spontaneous applause.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, right is supposed to matter,\\u201d Schiff told senators last night in the 10 p.m. hour, wrapping up day two of his case against Trump, which he will conclude Friday afternoon. \\u201cIt\\u2019s what\\u2019s made us the greatest nation on Earth. No Constitution can protect us if right doesn\\u2019t matter anymore. You know you can\\u2019t trust this president to do what\\u2019s right for this country. You can trust that he will do what\\u2019s right for Donald Trump. He\\u2019ll do it now. He\\u2019ll do it for the next several months. He\\u2019ll do it in the election if he\\u2019s allowed to. This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Democrat from California has repeatedly praised Vindman and others for \\u201csticking their necks out\\u201d to answer questions about the president\\u2019s alleged Ukraine coercion campaign when his former bosses, including ex-national security adviser John Bolton, refused to come before the House. \\u201cI have such admiration for the fact they did,\\u201d Schiff said on Wednesday. \\u201cBut what would really vindicate that leap of faith \\u2026 is if we show the same courage. They risked everything\\u2014their careers\\u2014and, yes, I know what you are asked to decide may risk yours too, but if they could show the courage, so can we.\\u201d\\n\\nOver the course of several hours earlier in the afternoon, Schiff had laid out 10 separate arguments for why Trump\\u2019s push to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden was intended for the president\\u2019s personal benefit and not to advance the national interest. \\u201cWhen we\\u2019re done, we believe that we will have made the case overwhelmingly that the president is guilty,\\u201d Schiff said. \\u201cIs there really any doubt about this? I mean, do we really have any doubt about the facts here? Does anybody really question whether the president is capable of what he\\u2019s charged with? No one is really making the argument Donald Trump would never do such a thing \\u2026 because, of course, we know that he would.\\u201d\\n\\nVindman remains assigned to the White House, something that has drawn the continuing ire of pro-Trump commentators. Schiff thanked senators last night for \\u201ckeeping an open mind about all of the issues we are presenting.\\u201d But, after Schiff spoke, Senate Republican leaders privately expressed growing confidence that they can win the vote next week to block additional witnesses from being summoned to testify. It\\u2019s not clear whether Schiff\\u2019s calls for courage have pushed any Republican senators toward breaking with the president and their party leaders on the key votes coming up next week surrounding summoning witnesses or subpoenaing documents.\\n\\n-- Schiff spoke a few hours after Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), one of the jurors, questioned Vindman\\u2019s patriotism by propagating an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory from the fever swamps of the dark corners of the pro-Trump fringe Internet. Blackburn claimed that Vindman once badmouthed the United States to Russians while serving overseas. \\u201cAdam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot,\\u201d she tweeted. \\u201cHow patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America\\u2019s greatest enemy?\\u201d\\n\\nVindman\\u2019s lawyer, former ambassador David Pressman, accused Blackburn of defaming his client. \\u201cThat a member of the Senate \\u2014 at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility \\u2014 would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice,\\u201d Pressman emailed. \\u201cWhile Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\\u201d\\n\\nBlackburn isn\\u2019t backing down and tweeted another attack around 8 p.m. Trump himself retweeted her this morning. The senator, who won Bob Corker's seat after he retired in 2018, has also accused Vindman of being a \\u201chandler\\u201d for the whistleblower who filed the complaint. Vindman testified before Schiff\\u2019s committee that he spoke with an intelligence community official about Trump\\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he declined to identify the official on the advice of counsel because he said he didn\\u2019t want to blow someone\\u2019s cover. But no public evidence exists that he was a source for the whistleblower.\\n\\n-- Schiff, a mild-mannered former federal prosecutor, has emerged as a surprisingly polarizing figure. Perhaps it\\u2019s because the president has accused him of committing treason, in addition to calling him \\u201cpencil neck\\u201d and \\u201cliddle.\\u201d Trump has now tweeted about Schiff hundreds of times. Schiff\\u2019s boosters say the right only loathes him because he\\u2019s so effective.\\n\\n-- The president\\u2019s allies at Fox News have elevated Schiff this week into perhaps the biggest boogeyman for their audience. Arguably he\\u2019s a bigger target of their vitriol right now than Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders or even the four minority women in the Squad. If you\\u2019ve watched the network for even a few minutes this week, especially in primetime, you\\u2019ve probably seen hosts and guests attacking the man from Burbank.\\n\\nTucker Carlson continued his mockery last night of the man he\\u2019s taken to calling \\u201cSaint Adam,\\u201d a nickname intended to convey what he portrays as the congressman\\u2019s sanctimoniousness. \\u201cSay what you will, but as a piece of theater, it had literally everything,\\u201d Carlson said after playing a video clip of Schiff talking on the Senate floor about how Trump\\u2019s approach to Ukraine has played into Russian President Vladimir Putin\\u2019s hands.\\n\\n\\u201cThey accused us of doing nefarious things with this Lev Parnas character,\\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told Sean Hannity. \\u201cThe truth is Adam Schiff and the Democrats have been doing nefarious things with Parnas!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAdam's ordinarily not that stupid, but when you tell the jury, the Senate, on one day that they're corrupt, and then you tell the American people they cannot be trusted to pick the commander in chief, that's just a wildly stupid trial strategy,\\u201d former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told Bret Baier.\\n\\n-- Rudy Giuliani appeared on \\u201cFox & Friends\\u201d this morning to attack the Democratic managers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a complete show on the part of the Democrats, and they should be sued for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and they should pay for that hearing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to present over the next two to three weeks shocking crimes at the highest levels of both governments while the Senate is listening to a totally phony group of stories about non-impeachable offenses.\\u201d\\n\\nGiuliani has been promising for a while now to release said evidence. It has not been forthcoming, so take such claims with more than a grain of salt. The president\\u2019s lawyer also said for months that he was going to release a lengthy report rebutting former special counsel Bob Mueller\\u2019s findings on Russian interference and whether Trump obstructed justice. He never did.\\n\\n-- Meanwhile, thought leaders on the left have effusively praised Schiff's performance. Esquire\\u2019s Charlie Pierce calls Schiff the Daniel Webster of our time. Walter Dellinger, who was acting U.S. solicitor general under Bill Clinton, said Schiff offered \\u201cone of the most impressive performances by a lawyer I have ever seen.\\u201d MSNBC legal commentator Jason Johnson called Schiff\\u2019s opening statement on Wednesday \\u201ca speech that kids will be giving in 2060 at university projects.\\u201d Actress and activist Alyssa Milano, who has been attending the trial, said \\u201cit felt like you were watching a one-man show on Broadway.\\u201d\\n\\nStephen Colbert offered an early valentine to Schiff during his show. \\u201cIt was gratifying to see someone taking the constitutional responsibility of their office seriously,\\u201d the comedian told his viewers on CBS. Breaking out of character, he said that Schiff spoke \\u201cclearly, passionately, cogently, and, I believe, courageously.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Schiff \\u201cwell spoken\\u201d and said \\u201cdid a good job of creating a tapestry.\\u201d But other Republican senators have told reporters that Schiff was overly \\u201csmooth\\u201d or \\u201cslick,\\u201d which they meant as negatives. \\u201cIn a way I do feel like I\\u2019m introducing myself to a number of the senators,\\u201d Schiff told the Associated Press, adding that they\\u2019re \\u201cfinding I\\u2019m not the demon that I\\u2019m portrayed as on Fox.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope that four Republicans still might be persuaded to vote for witnesses. \\u201cJust about every Republican\\u2019s eyes were glued on Mr. Schiff,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a powerful rendition.\\u201d\\n\\n-- All eyes are on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). \\u201cPrivately, senior Senate Republicans expect the vote to seek witness testimony to fail, but they are watching Alexander and several other Republicans closely. And wherever Alexander comes down is almost sure to be the majority position in the Senate,\\u201d Politico reports. \\u201cHe's a retiring defender of the Senate as an institution who's occasionally bucked his party, but he also counts Mitch McConnell as a longtime ally. He's more hesitant to criticize Trump than are some other Republicans, but he also has said it was \\u2018inappropriate\\u2019 for Trump to ask foreign governments to investigate his political opponents. \\u2026 [Democrats] are holding out hope that Alexander will be their hero in the mold of the late Sen. John McCain, whose extraordinary vote derailed the GOP\\u2019s effort to repeal Obamacare.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump is keeping his distance from the Republicans who might vote to call witnesses after White House advisers warned the president that outreach wouldn\\u2019t help his cause. Democrats are also giving them space. Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report: \\u201cDemocrats say there is no serious effort to privately lobby the Republicans, with the party relying instead on public opinion and the House prosecutors to squeeze them into breaking ranks.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) played with blue and purple fidget spinners. These are popular toys for children. In contrast, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who will potentially cast decisive votes on witnesses, almost never moved from their second-row desks. \\u201cCollins is a furious note taker, while Murkowski just stares intensely at the speaker,\\u201d Paul Kane reports.\\n\\n-- Collins sent a handwritten note to Roberts before his admonishment of the lawyers for both sides in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The senior senator for Maine, facing a tough reelection fight, told WCSH-TV in her state that the debate had become \\u201ctoo personal,\\u201d and she said she got mad when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Senate Republicans of being part of a coverup. \\u201cI had heard both sides impugn the integrity of one another and also cast aspersions on the Senate,\\u201d Collins said. \\u201cThat is just not appropriate.\\u201d Collins said she\\u2019s undecided on witnesses but added that the Nadler comments won\\u2019t affect her decision.\\n\\n-- Fresh polling shows most Americans overwhelmingly think witnesses should testify. An AP-NORC poll shows that 7 in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his top aides to appear before the Senate, including most Republicans. The same survey found that 45 percent think Trump should be convicted, 40 percent said he should not be and 14 percent said they don\\u2019t know enough to have an opinion.\\n\\n-- But, but, but: \\u201cMitch McConnell doesn\\u2019t care what you think,\\u201d Ben Terris writes in a new profile of the majority leader. \\u201cHe just wants to win.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A growing number of Republican senators are pointing to Trump's threat to invoke executive privilege as an excuse to vote against even trying to call witnesses, CNN reports: \\u201cGOP senators are privately and publicly raising concerns that issuing subpoenas -- to top officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton and for documents blocked by the White House -- will only serve to drag out the proceedings. Plus, many say there's little appetite for such a time-consuming fight, given that legal battles may ultimately not be successful and could force the courts to rule on hugely consequential constitutional issues about the separation of powers between the branches of government.\\u201d\\n\\nMORE FROM THE TRIAL:\\n\\n-- Democrats used a significant chunk of time on Thursday to preemptively defend the Bidens, who they expect Trump\\u2019s lawyers to attack when they get the floor: \\u201cRep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine,\\u201d Seung Min Kim, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. \\u201cBut Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump\\u2019s defense team. \\u2026 Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn\\u2019t focus on Biden\\u2019s actions toward Ukraine until 2019 \\u2026 She also referenced a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \\u2026 and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden\\u2019s desire to see [prosecutor Viktor] Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy \\u2026 As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cBefore the trial officially began Thursday afternoon, dozens of senators from both parties entered a secure facility in the Senate basement to view a classified document provided by Jennifer Williams, a national security adviser to Vice President Pence. \\u2026 The document had been previously submitted to the House Intelligence Committee. Some senators spent only a few minutes in the facility; others stayed for the better part of an hour. Several Democrats emerged to say they didn\\u2019t understand why the document had been classified. \\u2018I don\\u2019t believe it\\u2019s being withheld from the public for national security reasons. It may be withheld for political security reasons,\\u2019 said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).\\u201d\\n\\n-- The favorite talking point for most Senate Republicans continues to be that they\\u2019re learning nothing new because House managers are repeating themselves. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters during last night\\u2019s dinner break that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day in the Senate.\\u201d Ironically, he had repeated throughout the day that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day.\\u201d He said the same thing to CNN in the morning.\\n\\n\\u201cFor them to say they\\u2019re bored, it has a lot to do with them not wanting to hear evidence,\\u201d countered Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \\u201cThey don\\u2019t want to hear that this president who they\\u2019re so busy supporting did these things. As I put it, the truth hurts.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Tomorrow\\u2019s timing: Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) tells reporters that Saturday\\u2019s session will likely start and end earlier than the past few days. Party leaders are still trying to negotiate a deal to start the day as early as 8 a.m. so they can wrap up by noon. This would allow Democratic presidential candidates to fly to Iowa for campaign events. The trial has started at 1 p.m. during the week so that Chief Justice John Roberts can participate in pre-scheduled Supreme Court oral arguments before crossing the street to preside over the trial in the Capitol.\\n\\n-- Pelosi may be half a world away from the Senate floor, but that doesn\\u2019t mean the speaker doesn\\u2019t have the trial under control. From the Times: \\u201cEven in her absence from the Capitol this week, as the speaker traveled through Poland and Israel \\u2026 she had her hand firmly on the tiller. \\u2026 In many ways, Ms. Pelosi is the eighth, largely unseen manager of the Democrats\\u2019 case. \\u2026 Ms. Pelosi has dispatched her handpicked House general counsel to sit at the table inside the Senate chamber, with the prosecutors acting as her eyes and ears. She reviewed all the managers\\u2019 written briefs before they were filed.\\\"\\n\\n-- A core argument from Democrats yesterday was that the framers didn\\u2019t believe a president needed to break the law in order to warrant impeachment. \\u201cThe Constitution is not a suicide pact,\\u201d said Nadler, one of the managers. \\u201cIt does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The House\\u2019s lawyers filed a motion with an appeals court last night that says Trump\\u2019s defense lawyers have contradicted, and therefore undermined, the Department of Justice\\u2019s position on subpoenas. Ann Marimow reports: \\u201cThe lawyers for [Pelosi] asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to rule quickly on the pair of separation-of-powers cases, which they said could affect the Senate proceedings. House Democrats went to court seeking testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn and access to secret grand jury evidence from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\\u2019s Russia investigation. Justice Department attorneys have urged the appeals court to stay out of what they say are political disputes between Congress and the White House.\\u201d But the president\\u2019s team is now telling the Senate that these are matters more properly left to the courts.\\n\\n-- The White House also stonewalled the Government Accountability Office when the independent congressional watchdog requested information about the freeze on Ukraine aid. From Politico: \\u201cThe White House responded to the [GAO\\u2019s] inquiry with a one-page letter on Dec. 20, citing a legal memo from the Office of Management and Budget that defended the hold on military aid as necessary to ensure spending the funds wouldn't \\u2018conflict with the President's foreign policy.\\u2019 \\u2026 The correspondence is part of what led GAO to \\u2026 conclude last week that Trump's decision to withhold military aid violated federal law.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Follow the money: The documents turned over by Lev Parnas, Giuliani\\u2019s former associate, provide details about the web of dark money that helped fund Trump\\u2019s Ukrainian gambit. From Bloomberg News: \\u201cMoney flowed to Giuliani and his cohorts from home loans, friends, relative strangers and wealthy businessmen, some with interests in the gas and energy sector. It even came from a lawyer for an embattled Ukrainian energy tycoon fighting extradition to the U.S. on a conspiracy charge. \\u2026 The travel arrangements could brush up against campaign finance laws. While Giuliani [and Parnas] can volunteer as much of their time as they want for a campaign, any subsidy for such work by third parties would generally need to be reported as a contribution, and money from foreign individuals would be illegal.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dana Milbank: \\\"John Roberts comes face to face with the mess he made.\\\"\\n\\u2022 Ruth Marcus: \\u201cA more assertive John Roberts would be a bad idea.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Brenda Wineapple, author of a book on Andrew Johnson\\u2019s impeachment: \\u201cIf John Roberts is seeking a role model, let\\u2019s hope it\\u2019s not Salmon Chase.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Michael Gerson: \\u201cRepublicans aren\\u2019t serving the country, or even the president.

Sarah Ellison reports: \\u201cPouring attention on regional talk-radio hosts is a classic Trumpworld move: giving relatively unknown characters proximity to the White House has paid off with a disproportionate amount of attention and praise lavished on the president and his agenda. \\u2026 The strategy has been particularly powerful as Trump and his team have engaged in what [Steve] Bannon calls \\u2018information warfare\\u2019 over the impeachment fight...\\u201d\\n\\n-- Kamala \\\"that-little-girl-was-me\\\" Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joe Biden to boost her standing in the veepstakes. From the New York Times: \\u201cSuch a move could lift Mr. Biden\\u2019s campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris\\u2019s chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California. An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial \\u2026 She and [Biden] have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Anita Hill told an Iowa crowd last night that it\\u2019s too late for Biden to apologize for the way he mistreated and diminished her when she testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991. \\u201cThe statute of limitations for his apology is up,\\u201d Hill said in response to a question from the audience at the University of Iowa, where she gave a lecture on ending sexual harassment. \\u201cWhat are you going to do about it? What are you going to do today? Will you promise as leader of this country \\u2026 to use all of your energy to address the problem as it happened and to prevent it from happening to another generation? That\\u2019s what I want to hear. And I not only want to hear from him, I want to hear from every one of them who want to be the leader of this country.\\u201d (BuzzFeed News)\\n\\n-- Bernie Sanders asked his supporters to cool it \\u2013 but they don\\u2019t always listen. Sean Sullivan reports: \\u201cCampaign officials have been pressing surrogates and other allies not to escalate combustible disputes that have recently become more personal, ... including a tense fight with Joe Biden, a separate altercation with [Elizabeth Warren] and a renewed schism with Hillary Clinton. \\u2026 But many Sanders supporters, and even some campaign aides, are inclined to take a more aggressive approach that they say will highlight important differences. \\u2026 Some close Sanders allies acknowledged the difficulty of balancing the passions of his loyal backers, inspired by his calls for a political revolution and his staunchly liberal platform, with the need to demonstrate a broader unity.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sanders\\u2019s rise in the polls means he\\u2019ll be talking more about his electability than a revolution. While speeches he\\u2019s made over the past two weeks still feature his signature call to action, he\\u2019s spending more time explaining to voters how policies like Medicare-for-all would work in their daily lives, as well as how he could beat Trump. (Bloomberg News)\\n\\n-- One in five women doubt that a woman can win the presidency, according to a new CNN poll. What\\u2019s telling about this news is that just 9 percent of men said the same. (Eugene Scott)\\n\\n-- Mike Bloomberg may be lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, but he\\u2019s attracted the president\\u2019s obsessive attention by baiting him with constant attack ads. Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer report: \\u201cThe president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him \\u2018Mini Mike\\u2019 to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials. \\u2018It\\u2019s very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,\\u2019 said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide \\u2026 Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. \\u2026 Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on \\u2018Fox & Friends\\u2019 on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as \\u2018dopes and babies.\\u2019 Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Former top supporters of Cory Booker accused Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s campaign of \\u201cchasing ambulances.\\u201d From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cThe phone calls to Amy Nielsen came around two hours apart. It was last Monday around 12 p.m., not long after the news broke, when her phone lit up with his name. By then, Nielsen considered Cory Booker \\u2018part of [her] family.\\u2019 \\u2026 So the end of his campaign felt \\u2026 like \\u2018a death.\\u2019 \\u2026 The next call came around 2:30 p.m., this time from an unknown number. It was Pete Buttigieg, calling to seek Nielsen\\u2019s support now that her candidate had made the decision to \\u2018step aside.\\u2019 \\u2026 \\u2018It was a gut punch \\u2014 like, really? He did not \\u2018step aside\\u2019 for you,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Like, wow, that\\u2019s some nerve right there.\\u2019 Later that night, she said, Nielsen heard from one of Booker\\u2019s field organizers who said she had already been contacted by the Buttigieg campaign to go door-knock.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Twelve years ago, Buttigieg spent the final week before the 2008 caucuses in rural southwest Iowa, trying to turn out voters for Barack Obama in one of the most conservative towns in the state. Holly Bailey spoke with him about what he learned: \\u201c\\u2018This was a new experience to really talk to people like this,\\u2019 Buttigieg recalled. \\u2018And what I found was, first of all, you can\\u2019t assume where somebody is going to be. We were in an area where a lot of people weren\\u2019t Democrats to begin with, and those who were were more likely to be for [John] Edwards. But they would hear us out when we were talking about Obama. And sometimes, as you do when you go door-to-door, somebody, because you represent a presidential campaign, would just pour out everything that was on their mind, everything they were upset about.\\\"\\n\\n\\u00ad-- Early voting means that millions are already eligible to cast their ballot. From the AP: \\u201cIn Minnesota, in-person early voting began Jan. 17. Vermont\\u2019s deadline to mail out its absentee ballots was the same day. Many of the 14 Super Tuesday states will offer some form of early voting between now and mid-February.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Howard County saw a bigger swing from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 than any other in Iowa. The Wall Street Journal's John McCormick took the pulse for 2020: \\u201cRecent interviews with dozens of voters here suggest that most of Mr. Trump\\u2019s 2016 supporters ... plan to stick with him, even though some said they have grown weary of his personal behavior and trade fights. Among those who previously voted for Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, many said they are reserving judgment until they see who wins the Democratic nomination. \\u2026 What such swing voters do in 2020 will have national implications. Before Mr. Trump, Howard County hadn\\u2019t backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. It is one of the 31 counties in Iowa\\u2014the most of any state\\u2014that backed Mr. Obama twice and then switched to Mr. Trump. The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A new Iowa caucus app is sparking election security concerns. From NBC News: \\u201cThe app will be used in Iowa and Nevada by caucus managers \\u2014 local registered Democrats who sign up to organize and run the caucus process in each location \\u2014 to expedite the process, calculate and assign delegates and report results back quickly. The app will also be used in satellite voting locations across the country and overseas. But questions about the app remain unanswered, including who developed it and whether it has been subjected to independent security testing. Security experts say that the app is a potential target for early election interference, particularly since it is downloaded on to the personal phones of the caucus managers. Party officials say operational security prevents them from disclosing specifics about the app.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Big-money groups aligned with the Senate GOP raised $68.3 million in 2019, an off-year record. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \\u201cThe majority of the money raised in 2019 came in the latter half of the year, particularly in the final two months, largely driven by the House Democrats\\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The ranks of scientists are growing thin in the Trump administration. Annie Gowen, Juliet Eilperin, Ben Guarino and Andrew Ba Tran report: \\u201cDozens of government computers sit in a nondescript building [in Kansas City, Mo.], able to connect to a data model that could help farmers manage the impact of a changing climate on their crops. But no one in this federal agency would know how to access the model, or, if they did, what to do with the data. That\\u2019s because the ambitious federal researcher who created it in Washington quit rather than move when the Agriculture Department relocated his agency to an office park here last fall. He is one of hundreds of scientists across the federal government who have been forced out, sidelined or muted since President Trump took office. \\u2026 In the first two years of the Trump administration, more than 1,600 federal scientists left government, according to Office of Personnel Management employment data \\u2026 That represents a 1.5 percent drop, compared with the 8 percent increase during the same period in the Obama administration.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Justice Department conceded that it had \\u201cinsufficient\\u201d cause to continue monitoring a former Trump campaign adviser during the Russia probe. Matt Zapotosky reports: \\u201cThe concession was revealed in an order posted on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\\u2019s website. In December, according to the order, the department told the court it had come to believe that in at least two of the four applications to monitor the former adviser, Carter Page, \\u2018there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause\\u2019 to believe he was acting as a Russian agent.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Trump administration will create additional new hurdles for pregnant foreign women seeking U.S. tourist visas. The administration said it's trying to crack down on what it calls \\u201cbirth tourism,\\\" trying to reduce what conservatives call \\\"anchor babies,\\\" by instructing consular officers to assess whether women requesting tourist visas are hoping to give birth on U.S. soil, which would effectively grant their children American citizenship. Starting today, the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor visas to women hoping to travel to the country with the stated purpose of having a child. Foggy Bottom said consular officers cannot require pregnancy tests to make the determination but wouldn\\u2019t rule out a woman\\u2019s physical appearance when making the decision, per Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti.\\n\\n-- Trump's \\\"national public health emergency\\\" declaration on the opioid crisis expired because his people at the Department of Health and Human Services forgot to renew it. An HHS spokesperson said the nine-day lapse had been corrected and blamed a clerical error. The emergency status, first announced in 2017 as a measure deemed necessary to direct more resources toward the drug overdose crisis, needs to be renewed every 90 days.

I was just trying to get him away from me, and he took my hands and put them over my head,\\u2019 Sciorra told the jury in Weinstein\\u2019s sexual assault trial, her eyes welling up with tears and her voice breaking. \\u2026 Weinstein, who had been watching her from the defense table, turned his gaze away from his accuser as she emotionally detailed the encounter. \\u2026 In her five hours of testimony, she described freezing after the attack, adding that \\u2018It was just so disgusting that my body started to shake.\\u2019 She said she had no romantic interest in Weinstein.

But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies. Adding to the stress, Friday marked the official start of \\u2026 when China celebrates the arrival of the new lunar year. Authorities around the country, including in the capital Beijing, have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the holiday to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could be spread. \\u2026The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was already entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice.

A total of 8,420 were reported to be under observation. South Korean authorities confirmed Friday that a second person tested positive for the new coronavirus. \\u2026 Japan also confirmed a second case, a man in his 40s from Wuhan who arrived in Japan on Sunday on a flight through Hong Kong. Other countries to have reported infections including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to a confirmed case in Washington state, Texas has reported a potential case of coronavirus in Brazos County, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The patient contracted a respiratory illness within two weeks of traveling in Wuhan and is being isolated at home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\\n\\n\\u201cSome details about the latest deaths in China have raised concerns about the virus\\u2019s spread. Until now, the vast majority of the people had been older than 60 and almost all of them had existing health conditions.

Erin Cunningham and Mohammad Mahdi Sultani report: \\u201cDecades ago, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted thousands of people to flee to neighboring Iran. Now, many of these refugees are once again seeking a new home in a new land, Turkey, desperate to escape the dire economic conditions fueled by U.S. sanctions on Tehran. \\u2026 Turkish authorities are grappling with nearly 4 million refugees.

From the Daily Beast: \\u201cAbdulrahman Almutairi is a 27-year-old comedian and former student at the University of San Diego with a big social-media presence. After Almutairi used social media to criticize the powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman over the October 2018 murder and dismemberment of Washington Post contributor [Jamal] Khashoggi, an unidentified Saudi man accompanied Almutairi\\u2019s father on a flight to collect Almutairi against his will and bring him back to Saudi Arabia...\\\"\\n\\n-- The Trump administration has missed the deadline, established by law, to turn over to Congress an unclassified report on Khashoggi's murder and the role played by the regime in Riyadh. From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cIn December, lawmakers passed a sweeping defense bill that included a provision ordering the director of national intelligence to send Congress an unclassified report identifying those responsible for Khashoggi\\u2019s death at a Saudi Arabian consulate in 2018. The legislation set the deadline for the report at 30 days, which passed earlier this week.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A small team of FBI agents spent years trying to solve a stubborn mystery \\u2013 whether officials from Saudi Arabia were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. A team of ProPublica and NYT Magazine reporters tell their story: \\u201cThe FBI has disputed the idea that foreign-policy considerations significantly influenced its investigation. In interviews, current and former bureau officials and federal prosecutors insisted to us that they never would have hesitated to pursue any Saudi who could have been solidly linked to the 9/11 plot \\u2026 But others who worked on the matter, including some at the FBI\\u2019s highest levels, say that the United States\\u2019 complex and often-troubled relationship with the Saudi regime was an unavoidable fact throughout their investigations. Even as the Saudi authorities became more cooperative with the United States in fighting al-Qaida after 2003, they were minimally and grudgingly helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry. According to current and former officials, requests for assistance that might rattle the Saudi security agencies were frequently balanced against FBI and CIA needs for Saudi help against continuing terror threats.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival, Benny Gantz, next week to discuss his Middle East peace plan.

Col. Alexander Vindman as the model of courage that Senate Republicans should follow during President Trump's trial.\\n\\nThe House Intelligence chairman fought back emotion late last night as he recalled Vindman\\u2019s November appearance before his committee. Vindman was born in the Soviet Union, but his father brought him here when he was a young boy. The director of European Affairs on the National Security Council, who received a Purple Heart after he was injured in Iraq, said that his father worried when he told him he would testify. But he reassured him. \\u201cThis is America,\\u201d Vindman recalled telling his dad. \\u201cHere, right matters.\\u201d The audience broke into spontaneous applause.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, right is supposed to matter,\\u201d Schiff told senators last night in the 10 p.m. hour, wrapping up day two of his case against Trump, which he will conclude Friday afternoon. \\u201cIt\\u2019s what\\u2019s made us the greatest nation on Earth. No Constitution can protect us if right doesn\\u2019t matter anymore. You know you can\\u2019t trust this president to do what\\u2019s right for this country. You can trust that he will do what\\u2019s right for Donald Trump. He\\u2019ll do it now. He\\u2019ll do it for the next several months. He\\u2019ll do it in the election if he\\u2019s allowed to. This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Democrat from California has repeatedly praised Vindman and others for \\u201csticking their necks out\\u201d to answer questions about the president\\u2019s alleged Ukraine coercion campaign when his former bosses, including ex-national security adviser John Bolton, refused to come before the House. \\u201cI have such admiration for the fact they did,\\u201d Schiff said on Wednesday. \\u201cBut what would really vindicate that leap of faith \\u2026 is if we show the same courage. They risked everything\\u2014their careers\\u2014and, yes, I know what you are asked to decide may risk yours too, but if they could show the courage, so can we.\\u201d\\n\\nOver the course of several hours earlier in the afternoon, Schiff had laid out 10 separate arguments for why Trump\\u2019s push to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden was intended for the president\\u2019s personal benefit and not to advance the national interest. \\u201cWhen we\\u2019re done, we believe that we will have made the case overwhelmingly that the president is guilty,\\u201d Schiff said. \\u201cIs there really any doubt about this? I mean, do we really have any doubt about the facts here? Does anybody really question whether the president is capable of what he\\u2019s charged with? No one is really making the argument Donald Trump would never do such a thing \\u2026 because, of course, we know that he would.\\u201d\\n\\nVindman remains assigned to the White House, something that has drawn the continuing ire of pro-Trump commentators. Schiff thanked senators last night for \\u201ckeeping an open mind about all of the issues we are presenting.\\u201d But, after Schiff spoke, Senate Republican leaders privately expressed growing confidence that they can win the vote next week to block additional witnesses from being summoned to testify. It\\u2019s not clear whether Schiff\\u2019s calls for courage have pushed any Republican senators toward breaking with the president and their party leaders on the key votes coming up next week surrounding summoning witnesses or subpoenaing documents.\\n\\n-- Schiff spoke a few hours after Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), one of the jurors, questioned Vindman\\u2019s patriotism by propagating an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory from the fever swamps of the dark corners of the pro-Trump fringe Internet. Blackburn claimed that Vindman once badmouthed the United States to Russians while serving overseas. \\u201cAdam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot,\\u201d she tweeted. \\u201cHow patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America\\u2019s greatest enemy?\\u201d\\n\\nVindman\\u2019s lawyer, former ambassador David Pressman, accused Blackburn of defaming his client. \\u201cThat a member of the Senate \\u2014 at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility \\u2014 would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice,\\u201d Pressman emailed. \\u201cWhile Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\\u201d\\n\\nBlackburn isn\\u2019t backing down and tweeted another attack around 8 p.m. Trump himself retweeted her this morning. The senator, who won Bob Corker's seat after he retired in 2018, has also accused Vindman of being a \\u201chandler\\u201d for the whistleblower who filed the complaint. Vindman testified before Schiff\\u2019s committee that he spoke with an intelligence community official about Trump\\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he declined to identify the official on the advice of counsel because he said he didn\\u2019t want to blow someone\\u2019s cover. But no public evidence exists that he was a source for the whistleblower.\\n\\n-- Schiff, a mild-mannered former federal prosecutor, has emerged as a surprisingly polarizing figure. Perhaps it\\u2019s because the president has accused him of committing treason, in addition to calling him \\u201cpencil neck\\u201d and \\u201cliddle.\\u201d Trump has now tweeted about Schiff hundreds of times. Schiff\\u2019s boosters say the right only loathes him because he\\u2019s so effective.\\n\\n-- The president\\u2019s allies at Fox News have elevated Schiff this week into perhaps the biggest boogeyman for their audience. Arguably he\\u2019s a bigger target of their vitriol right now than Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders or even the four minority women in the Squad. If you\\u2019ve watched the network for even a few minutes this week, especially in primetime, you\\u2019ve probably seen hosts and guests attacking the man from Burbank.\\n\\nTucker Carlson continued his mockery last night of the man he\\u2019s taken to calling \\u201cSaint Adam,\\u201d a nickname intended to convey what he portrays as the congressman\\u2019s sanctimoniousness. \\u201cSay what you will, but as a piece of theater, it had literally everything,\\u201d Carlson said after playing a video clip of Schiff talking on the Senate floor about how Trump\\u2019s approach to Ukraine has played into Russian President Vladimir Putin\\u2019s hands.\\n\\n\\u201cThey accused us of doing nefarious things with this Lev Parnas character,\\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told Sean Hannity. \\u201cThe truth is Adam Schiff and the Democrats have been doing nefarious things with Parnas!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAdam's ordinarily not that stupid, but when you tell the jury, the Senate, on one day that they're corrupt, and then you tell the American people they cannot be trusted to pick the commander in chief, that's just a wildly stupid trial strategy,\\u201d former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told Bret Baier.\\n\\n-- Rudy Giuliani appeared on \\u201cFox & Friends\\u201d this morning to attack the Democratic managers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a complete show on the part of the Democrats, and they should be sued for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and they should pay for that hearing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to present over the next two to three weeks shocking crimes at the highest levels of both governments while the Senate is listening to a totally phony group of stories about non-impeachable offenses.\\u201d\\n\\nGiuliani has been promising for a while now to release said evidence. It has not been forthcoming, so take such claims with more than a grain of salt. The president\\u2019s lawyer also said for months that he was going to release a lengthy report rebutting former special counsel Bob Mueller\\u2019s findings on Russian interference and whether Trump obstructed justice. He never did.\\n\\n-- Meanwhile, thought leaders on the left have effusively praised Schiff's performance. Esquire\\u2019s Charlie Pierce calls Schiff the Daniel Webster of our time. Walter Dellinger, who was acting U.S. solicitor general under Bill Clinton, said Schiff offered \\u201cone of the most impressive performances by a lawyer I have ever seen.\\u201d MSNBC legal commentator Jason Johnson called Schiff\\u2019s opening statement on Wednesday \\u201ca speech that kids will be giving in 2060 at university projects.\\u201d Actress and activist Alyssa Milano, who has been attending the trial, said \\u201cit felt like you were watching a one-man show on Broadway.\\u201d\\n\\nStephen Colbert offered an early valentine to Schiff during his show. \\u201cIt was gratifying to see someone taking the constitutional responsibility of their office seriously,\\u201d the comedian told his viewers on CBS. Breaking out of character, he said that Schiff spoke \\u201cclearly, passionately, cogently, and, I believe, courageously.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Schiff \\u201cwell spoken\\u201d and said \\u201cdid a good job of creating a tapestry.\\u201d But other Republican senators have told reporters that Schiff was overly \\u201csmooth\\u201d or \\u201cslick,\\u201d which they meant as negatives. \\u201cIn a way I do feel like I\\u2019m introducing myself to a number of the senators,\\u201d Schiff told the Associated Press, adding that they\\u2019re \\u201cfinding I\\u2019m not the demon that I\\u2019m portrayed as on Fox.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope that four Republicans still might be persuaded to vote for witnesses. \\u201cJust about every Republican\\u2019s eyes were glued on Mr. Schiff,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a powerful rendition.\\u201d\\n\\n-- All eyes are on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). \\u201cPrivately, senior Senate Republicans expect the vote to seek witness testimony to fail, but they are watching Alexander and several other Republicans closely. And wherever Alexander comes down is almost sure to be the majority position in the Senate,\\u201d Politico reports. \\u201cHe's a retiring defender of the Senate as an institution who's occasionally bucked his party, but he also counts Mitch McConnell as a longtime ally. He's more hesitant to criticize Trump than are some other Republicans, but he also has said it was \\u2018inappropriate\\u2019 for Trump to ask foreign governments to investigate his political opponents. \\u2026 [Democrats] are holding out hope that Alexander will be their hero in the mold of the late Sen. John McCain, whose extraordinary vote derailed the GOP\\u2019s effort to repeal Obamacare.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump is keeping his distance from the Republicans who might vote to call witnesses after White House advisers warned the president that outreach wouldn\\u2019t help his cause. Democrats are also giving them space. Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report: \\u201cDemocrats say there is no serious effort to privately lobby the Republicans, with the party relying instead on public opinion and the House prosecutors to squeeze them into breaking ranks.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) played with blue and purple fidget spinners. These are popular toys for children. In contrast, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who will potentially cast decisive votes on witnesses, almost never moved from their second-row desks. \\u201cCollins is a furious note taker, while Murkowski just stares intensely at the speaker,\\u201d Paul Kane reports.\\n\\n-- Collins sent a handwritten note to Roberts before his admonishment of the lawyers for both sides in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The senior senator for Maine, facing a tough reelection fight, told WCSH-TV in her state that the debate had become \\u201ctoo personal,\\u201d and she said she got mad when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Senate Republicans of being part of a coverup. \\u201cI had heard both sides impugn the integrity of one another and also cast aspersions on the Senate,\\u201d Collins said. \\u201cThat is just not appropriate.\\u201d Collins said she\\u2019s undecided on witnesses but added that the Nadler comments won\\u2019t affect her decision.\\n\\n-- Fresh polling shows most Americans overwhelmingly think witnesses should testify. An AP-NORC poll shows that 7 in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his top aides to appear before the Senate, including most Republicans. The same survey found that 45 percent think Trump should be convicted, 40 percent said he should not be and 14 percent said they don\\u2019t know enough to have an opinion.\\n\\n-- But, but, but: \\u201cMitch McConnell doesn\\u2019t care what you think,\\u201d Ben Terris writes in a new profile of the majority leader. \\u201cHe just wants to win.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A growing number of Republican senators are pointing to Trump's threat to invoke executive privilege as an excuse to vote against even trying to call witnesses, CNN reports: \\u201cGOP senators are privately and publicly raising concerns that issuing subpoenas -- to top officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton and for documents blocked by the White House -- will only serve to drag out the proceedings. Plus, many say there's little appetite for such a time-consuming fight, given that legal battles may ultimately not be successful and could force the courts to rule on hugely consequential constitutional issues about the separation of powers between the branches of government.\\u201d\\n\\nMORE FROM THE TRIAL:\\n\\n-- Democrats used a significant chunk of time on Thursday to preemptively defend the Bidens, who they expect Trump\\u2019s lawyers to attack when they get the floor: \\u201cRep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine,\\u201d Seung Min Kim, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. \\u201cBut Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump\\u2019s defense team. \\u2026 Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn\\u2019t focus on Biden\\u2019s actions toward Ukraine until 2019 \\u2026 She also referenced a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \\u2026 and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden\\u2019s desire to see [prosecutor Viktor] Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy \\u2026 As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cBefore the trial officially began Thursday afternoon, dozens of senators from both parties entered a secure facility in the Senate basement to view a classified document provided by Jennifer Williams, a national security adviser to Vice President Pence. \\u2026 The document had been previously submitted to the House Intelligence Committee. Some senators spent only a few minutes in the facility; others stayed for the better part of an hour. Several Democrats emerged to say they didn\\u2019t understand why the document had been classified. \\u2018I don\\u2019t believe it\\u2019s being withheld from the public for national security reasons. It may be withheld for political security reasons,\\u2019 said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).\\u201d\\n\\n-- The favorite talking point for most Senate Republicans continues to be that they\\u2019re learning nothing new because House managers are repeating themselves. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters during last night\\u2019s dinner break that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day in the Senate.\\u201d Ironically, he had repeated throughout the day that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day.\\u201d He said the same thing to CNN in the morning.\\n\\n\\u201cFor them to say they\\u2019re bored, it has a lot to do with them not wanting to hear evidence,\\u201d countered Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \\u201cThey don\\u2019t want to hear that this president who they\\u2019re so busy supporting did these things. As I put it, the truth hurts.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Tomorrow\\u2019s timing: Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) tells reporters that Saturday\\u2019s session will likely start and end earlier than the past few days. Party leaders are still trying to negotiate a deal to start the day as early as 8 a.m. so they can wrap up by noon. This would allow Democratic presidential candidates to fly to Iowa for campaign events. The trial has started at 1 p.m. during the week so that Chief Justice John Roberts can participate in pre-scheduled Supreme Court oral arguments before crossing the street to preside over the trial in the Capitol.\\n\\n-- Pelosi may be half a world away from the Senate floor, but that doesn\\u2019t mean the speaker doesn\\u2019t have the trial under control. From the Times: \\u201cEven in her absence from the Capitol this week, as the speaker traveled through Poland and Israel \\u2026 she had her hand firmly on the tiller. \\u2026 In many ways, Ms. Pelosi is the eighth, largely unseen manager of the Democrats\\u2019 case. \\u2026 Ms. Pelosi has dispatched her handpicked House general counsel to sit at the table inside the Senate chamber, with the prosecutors acting as her eyes and ears. She reviewed all the managers\\u2019 written briefs before they were filed.\\\"\\n\\n-- A core argument from Democrats yesterday was that the framers didn\\u2019t believe a president needed to break the law in order to warrant impeachment. \\u201cThe Constitution is not a suicide pact,\\u201d said Nadler, one of the managers. \\u201cIt does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The House\\u2019s lawyers filed a motion with an appeals court last night that says Trump\\u2019s defense lawyers have contradicted, and therefore undermined, the Department of Justice\\u2019s position on subpoenas. Ann Marimow reports: \\u201cThe lawyers for [Pelosi] asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to rule quickly on the pair of separation-of-powers cases, which they said could affect the Senate proceedings. House Democrats went to court seeking testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn and access to secret grand jury evidence from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\\u2019s Russia investigation. Justice Department attorneys have urged the appeals court to stay out of what they say are political disputes between Congress and the White House.\\u201d But the president\\u2019s team is now telling the Senate that these are matters more properly left to the courts.\\n\\n-- The White House also stonewalled the Government Accountability Office when the independent congressional watchdog requested information about the freeze on Ukraine aid. From Politico: \\u201cThe White House responded to the [GAO\\u2019s] inquiry with a one-page letter on Dec. 20, citing a legal memo from the Office of Management and Budget that defended the hold on military aid as necessary to ensure spending the funds wouldn't \\u2018conflict with the President's foreign policy.\\u2019 \\u2026 The correspondence is part of what led GAO to \\u2026 conclude last week that Trump's decision to withhold military aid violated federal law.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Follow the money: The documents turned over by Lev Parnas, Giuliani\\u2019s former associate, provide details about the web of dark money that helped fund Trump\\u2019s Ukrainian gambit. From Bloomberg News: \\u201cMoney flowed to Giuliani and his cohorts from home loans, friends, relative strangers and wealthy businessmen, some with interests in the gas and energy sector. It even came from a lawyer for an embattled Ukrainian energy tycoon fighting extradition to the U.S. on a conspiracy charge. \\u2026 The travel arrangements could brush up against campaign finance laws. While Giuliani [and Parnas] can volunteer as much of their time as they want for a campaign, any subsidy for such work by third parties would generally need to be reported as a contribution, and money from foreign individuals would be illegal.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dana Milbank: \\\"John Roberts comes face to face with the mess he made.\\\"\\n\\u2022 Ruth Marcus: \\u201cA more assertive John Roberts would be a bad idea.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Brenda Wineapple, author of a book on Andrew Johnson\\u2019s impeachment: \\u201cIf John Roberts is seeking a role model, let\\u2019s hope it\\u2019s not Salmon Chase.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Michael Gerson: \\u201cRepublicans aren\\u2019t serving the country, or even the president. Just themselves.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Eugene Robinson: \\u201cSenate Republicans\\u2019 defense of Trump is as mushy as apple pie.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Garret Graff, founding director of the Aspen Institute\\u2019s Cyber & Technology Program: \\u201cTrump won\\u2019t protect our elections, so private companies are doing it.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dan Drezner: \\u201cWhen American political institutions give up: After three years of Trump, there have been some unhealthy adjustments.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Regional radio hosts across the country have found themselves showered with attention by senior Trump officials, who have made accessibility to local conservative talking heads a central part of the president\\u2019s reelection strategy. Sarah Ellison reports: \\u201cPouring attention on regional talk-radio hosts is a classic Trumpworld move: giving relatively unknown characters proximity to the White House has paid off with a disproportionate amount of attention and praise lavished on the president and his agenda. \\u2026 The strategy has been particularly powerful as Trump and his team have engaged in what [Steve] Bannon calls \\u2018information warfare\\u2019 over the impeachment fight...\\u201d\\n\\n-- Kamala \\\"that-little-girl-was-me\\\" Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joe Biden to boost her standing in the veepstakes. From the New York Times: \\u201cSuch a move could lift Mr. Biden\\u2019s campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris\\u2019s chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California. An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial \\u2026 She and [Biden] have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Anita Hill told an Iowa crowd last night that it\\u2019s too late for Biden to apologize for the way he mistreated and diminished her when she testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991. \\u201cThe statute of limitations for his apology is up,\\u201d Hill said in response to a question from the audience at the University of Iowa, where she gave a lecture on ending sexual harassment. \\u201cWhat are you going to do about it? What are you going to do today? Will you promise as leader of this country \\u2026 to use all of your energy to address the problem as it happened and to prevent it from happening to another generation? That\\u2019s what I want to hear. And I not only want to hear from him, I want to hear from every one of them who want to be the leader of this country.\\u201d (BuzzFeed News)\\n\\n-- Bernie Sanders asked his supporters to cool it \\u2013 but they don\\u2019t always listen. Sean Sullivan reports: \\u201cCampaign officials have been pressing surrogates and other allies not to escalate combustible disputes that have recently become more personal, ... including a tense fight with Joe Biden, a separate altercation with [Elizabeth Warren] and a renewed schism with Hillary Clinton. \\u2026 But many Sanders supporters, and even some campaign aides, are inclined to take a more aggressive approach that they say will highlight important differences. \\u2026 Some close Sanders allies acknowledged the difficulty of balancing the passions of his loyal backers, inspired by his calls for a political revolution and his staunchly liberal platform, with the need to demonstrate a broader unity.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sanders\\u2019s rise in the polls means he\\u2019ll be talking more about his electability than a revolution. While speeches he\\u2019s made over the past two weeks still feature his signature call to action, he\\u2019s spending more time explaining to voters how policies like Medicare-for-all would work in their daily lives, as well as how he could beat Trump. (Bloomberg News)\\n\\n-- One in five women doubt that a woman can win the presidency, according to a new CNN poll. What\\u2019s telling about this news is that just 9 percent of men said the same. (Eugene Scott)\\n\\n-- Mike Bloomberg may be lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, but he\\u2019s attracted the president\\u2019s obsessive attention by baiting him with constant attack ads. Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer report: \\u201cThe president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him \\u2018Mini Mike\\u2019 to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials. \\u2018It\\u2019s very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,\\u2019 said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide \\u2026 Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. \\u2026 Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on \\u2018Fox & Friends\\u2019 on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as \\u2018dopes and babies.\\u2019 Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Former top supporters of Cory Booker accused Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s campaign of \\u201cchasing ambulances.\\u201d From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cThe phone calls to Amy Nielsen came around two hours apart. It was last Monday around 12 p.m., not long after the news broke, when her phone lit up with his name. By then, Nielsen considered Cory Booker \\u2018part of [her] family.\\u2019 \\u2026 So the end of his campaign felt \\u2026 like \\u2018a death.\\u2019 \\u2026 The next call came around 2:30 p.m., this time from an unknown number. It was Pete Buttigieg, calling to seek Nielsen\\u2019s support now that her candidate had made the decision to \\u2018step aside.\\u2019 \\u2026 \\u2018It was a gut punch \\u2014 like, really? He did not \\u2018step aside\\u2019 for you,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Like, wow, that\\u2019s some nerve right there.\\u2019 Later that night, she said, Nielsen heard from one of Booker\\u2019s field organizers who said she had already been contacted by the Buttigieg campaign to go door-knock.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Twelve years ago, Buttigieg spent the final week before the 2008 caucuses in rural southwest Iowa, trying to turn out voters for Barack Obama in one of the most conservative towns in the state. Holly Bailey spoke with him about what he learned: \\u201c\\u2018This was a new experience to really talk to people like this,\\u2019 Buttigieg recalled. \\u2018And what I found was, first of all, you can\\u2019t assume where somebody is going to be. We were in an area where a lot of people weren\\u2019t Democrats to begin with, and those who were were more likely to be for [John] Edwards. But they would hear us out when we were talking about Obama. And sometimes, as you do when you go door-to-door, somebody, because you represent a presidential campaign, would just pour out everything that was on their mind, everything they were upset about.\\\"\\n\\n\\u00ad-- Early voting means that millions are already eligible to cast their ballot. From the AP: \\u201cIn Minnesota, in-person early voting began Jan. 17. Vermont\\u2019s deadline to mail out its absentee ballots was the same day. Many of the 14 Super Tuesday states will offer some form of early voting between now and mid-February.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Howard County saw a bigger swing from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 than any other in Iowa. The Wall Street Journal's John McCormick took the pulse for 2020: \\u201cRecent interviews with dozens of voters here suggest that most of Mr. Trump\\u2019s 2016 supporters ... plan to stick with him, even though some said they have grown weary of his personal behavior and trade fights. Among those who previously voted for Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, many said they are reserving judgment until they see who wins the Democratic nomination. \\u2026 What such swing voters do in 2020 will have national implications. Before Mr. Trump, Howard County hadn\\u2019t backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. It is one of the 31 counties in Iowa\\u2014the most of any state\\u2014that backed Mr. Obama twice and then switched to Mr. Trump. The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A new Iowa caucus app is sparking election security concerns. From NBC News: \\u201cThe app will be used in Iowa and Nevada by caucus managers \\u2014 local registered Democrats who sign up to organize and run the caucus process in each location \\u2014 to expedite the process, calculate and assign delegates and report results back quickly. The app will also be used in satellite voting locations across the country and overseas. But questions about the app remain unanswered, including who developed it and whether it has been subjected to independent security testing. Security experts say that the app is a potential target for early election interference, particularly since it is downloaded on to the personal phones of the caucus managers. Party officials say operational security prevents them from disclosing specifics about the app.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Big-money groups aligned with the Senate GOP raised $68.3 million in 2019, an off-year record. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \\u201cThe majority of the money raised in 2019 came in the latter half of the year, particularly in the final two months, largely driven by the House Democrats\\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The ranks of scientists are growing thin in the Trump administration. Annie Gowen, Juliet Eilperin, Ben Guarino and Andrew Ba Tran report: \\u201cDozens of government computers sit in a nondescript building [in Kansas City, Mo.], able to connect to a data model that could help farmers manage the impact of a changing climate on their crops. But no one in this federal agency would know how to access the model, or, if they did, what to do with the data. That\\u2019s because the ambitious federal researcher who created it in Washington quit rather than move when the Agriculture Department relocated his agency to an office park here last fall. He is one of hundreds of scientists across the federal government who have been forced out, sidelined or muted since President Trump took office. \\u2026 In the first two years of the Trump administration, more than 1,600 federal scientists left government, according to Office of Personnel Management employment data \\u2026 That represents a 1.5 percent drop, compared with the 8 percent increase during the same period in the Obama administration.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Justice Department conceded that it had \\u201cinsufficient\\u201d cause to continue monitoring a former Trump campaign adviser during the Russia probe. Matt Zapotosky reports: \\u201cThe concession was revealed in an order posted on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\\u2019s website. In December, according to the order, the department told the court it had come to believe that in at least two of the four applications to monitor the former adviser, Carter Page, \\u2018there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause\\u2019 to believe he was acting as a Russian agent.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Trump administration will create additional new hurdles for pregnant foreign women seeking U.S. tourist visas. The administration said it's trying to crack down on what it calls \\u201cbirth tourism,\\\" trying to reduce what conservatives call \\\"anchor babies,\\\" by instructing consular officers to assess whether women requesting tourist visas are hoping to give birth on U.S. soil, which would effectively grant their children American citizenship. Starting today, the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor visas to women hoping to travel to the country with the stated purpose of having a child. Foggy Bottom said consular officers cannot require pregnancy tests to make the determination but wouldn\\u2019t rule out a woman\\u2019s physical appearance when making the decision, per Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti.\\n\\n-- Trump's \\\"national public health emergency\\\" declaration on the opioid crisis expired because his people at the Department of Health and Human Services forgot to renew it. An HHS spokesperson said the nine-day lapse had been corrected and blamed a clerical error. The emergency status, first announced in 2017 as a measure deemed necessary to direct more resources toward the drug overdose crisis, needs to be renewed every 90 days. (Politico)\\n\\n-- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, 17, needs to study economics before offering her thoughts on climate change. Heather Long reports from Davos: \\u201cThunberg and Mnuchin are both attending the World Economic Forum this week. \\u2026 At a news conference on Thursday, Mnuchin was asked for his reaction to Thunberg\\u2019s insistence on fossil fuel divestment. \\u2018Who is she?\\u2019 he tried to joke to reporters before taking a jab at Thunberg, suggesting she didn\\u2019t understand what she was talking about. \\u2026 \\u2018Is she the chief economist or who is she? I\\u2019m confused. ... After she goes and studies economics in college she can go back and explain that to us.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\n-- Actress Annabella Sciorra, who played Gloria in \\\"The Sopranos,\\\" testified that Harvey Weinstein raped her more than 25 years ago. Shayna Jacobs reports: \\u201c\\u2018I was punching him. I was kicking him. I was just trying to get him away from me, and he took my hands and put them over my head,\\u2019 Sciorra told the jury in Weinstein\\u2019s sexual assault trial, her eyes welling up with tears and her voice breaking. \\u2026 Weinstein, who had been watching her from the defense table, turned his gaze away from his accuser as she emotionally detailed the encounter. \\u2026 In her five hours of testimony, she described freezing after the attack, adding that \\u2018It was just so disgusting that my body started to shake.\\u2019 She said she had no romantic interest in Weinstein. The film producer arrived at her Manhattan apartment uninvited one night.\\u201d\\n\\n-- \\u201cA young, healthy man from Wuhan and a person living 1,500 miles from the epicenter of the coronavirus are among the latest victims of the outbreak, which has incited fear and anger across China as the important Spring Festival gets underway,\\u201d Anna Fifield reports from Beijing. \\u201cReports of eight new deaths from the pneumonia-like virus, taking the total to 26, came as authorities enforced a lockdown across large parts of the province of Hubei, population 59 million. But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies. Adding to the stress, Friday marked the official start of \\u2026 when China celebrates the arrival of the new lunar year. Authorities around the country, including in the capital Beijing, have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the holiday to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could be spread. \\u2026The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was already entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice. Production companies have postponed the release of seven blockbuster films that were to be released over the holiday, leading Chinese cinema companies to close the country\\u2019s 70,000 movie theaters. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cThe National Health Commission reported Friday that there are now more than 830 confirmed cases of infection, and reports of new cases continued to roll in from around the country: from Xinjiang in the west to Shandong in the east, from Inner Mongolia in the north to Hainan in the south. A total of 8,420 were reported to be under observation. South Korean authorities confirmed Friday that a second person tested positive for the new coronavirus. \\u2026 Japan also confirmed a second case, a man in his 40s from Wuhan who arrived in Japan on Sunday on a flight through Hong Kong. Other countries to have reported infections including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to a confirmed case in Washington state, Texas has reported a potential case of coronavirus in Brazos County, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The patient contracted a respiratory illness within two weeks of traveling in Wuhan and is being isolated at home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\\n\\n\\u201cSome details about the latest deaths in China have raised concerns about the virus\\u2019s spread. Until now, the vast majority of the people had been older than 60 and almost all of them had existing health conditions. All of them had been in Hubei province \\u2026 But the latest announcement said that 36-year-old man from Wuhan, identified only by his family name, Li, died on Thursday. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions, and had been treated with anti-virus medication and antibiotics since being admitted to a hospital on Jan. 9.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Wall Street stumbled yesterday amid fears that efforts to curtail the virus could further disrupt the global economy. (David Lynch)\\n\\n-- The U.S. has officially refused to extradite Anne Sacoolas, the diplomat\\u2019s wife who fled the U.K. to avoid facing charges for killing a British teen by driving on the wrong side of the road. A State Department spokesman said extraditing Sacoolas would \\u201cset an extraordinarily troubling precedent\\u201d but did not elaborate. (Meagan Flynn)\\n\\n-- Trump\\u2019s sanctions on Iran are fueling a new refugee crisis \\u2013 in Turkey. Erin Cunningham and Mohammad Mahdi Sultani report: \\u201cDecades ago, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted thousands of people to flee to neighboring Iran. Now, many of these refugees are once again seeking a new home in a new land, Turkey, desperate to escape the dire economic conditions fueled by U.S. sanctions on Tehran. \\u2026 Turkish authorities are grappling with nearly 4 million refugees. This is the world\\u2019s largest population of displaced people, according to the United Nations, including more than 170,000 registered Afghan refugees. Turkey has struggled to contain the influx even as aid agencies say the number of arrivals from Iran is on the rise.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A critic of the Saudi Arabian government said a suspected Saudi agent tried to kidnap him on U.S. soil, a claim backed up by multiple U.S. and foreign sources familiar with the episode. From the Daily Beast: \\u201cAbdulrahman Almutairi is a 27-year-old comedian and former student at the University of San Diego with a big social-media presence. After Almutairi used social media to criticize the powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman over the October 2018 murder and dismemberment of Washington Post contributor [Jamal] Khashoggi, an unidentified Saudi man accompanied Almutairi\\u2019s father on a flight to collect Almutairi against his will and bring him back to Saudi Arabia...\\\"\\n\\n-- The Trump administration has missed the deadline, established by law, to turn over to Congress an unclassified report on Khashoggi's murder and the role played by the regime in Riyadh. From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cIn December, lawmakers passed a sweeping defense bill that included a provision ordering the director of national intelligence to send Congress an unclassified report identifying those responsible for Khashoggi\\u2019s death at a Saudi Arabian consulate in 2018. The legislation set the deadline for the report at 30 days, which passed earlier this week.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A small team of FBI agents spent years trying to solve a stubborn mystery \\u2013 whether officials from Saudi Arabia were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. A team of ProPublica and NYT Magazine reporters tell their story: \\u201cThe FBI has disputed the idea that foreign-policy considerations significantly influenced its investigation. In interviews, current and former bureau officials and federal prosecutors insisted to us that they never would have hesitated to pursue any Saudi who could have been solidly linked to the 9/11 plot \\u2026 But others who worked on the matter, including some at the FBI\\u2019s highest levels, say that the United States\\u2019 complex and often-troubled relationship with the Saudi regime was an unavoidable fact throughout their investigations. Even as the Saudi authorities became more cooperative with the United States in fighting al-Qaida after 2003, they were minimally and grudgingly helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry. According to current and former officials, requests for assistance that might rattle the Saudi security agencies were frequently balanced against FBI and CIA needs for Saudi help against continuing terror threats.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival, Benny Gantz, next week to discuss his Middle East peace plan. The meeting comes amid Trump\\u2019s trial, as well as Netanyahu and Gantz\\u2019s own troubles at home, where they\\u2019ve both failed to form a government.

Col. Alexander Vindman as the model of courage that Senate Republicans should follow during President Trump's trial.\\n\\nThe House Intelligence chairman fought back emotion late last night as he recalled Vindman\\u2019s November appearance before his committee. Vindman was born in the Soviet Union, but his father brought him here when he was a young boy. The director of European Affairs on the National Security Council, who received a Purple Heart after he was injured in Iraq, said that his father worried when he told him he would testify. But he reassured him. \\u201cThis is America,\\u201d Vindman recalled telling his dad. \\u201cHere, right matters.\\u201d The audience broke into spontaneous applause.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, right is supposed to matter,\\u201d Schiff told senators last night in the 10 p.m. hour, wrapping up day two of his case against Trump, which he will conclude Friday afternoon. \\u201cIt\\u2019s what\\u2019s made us the greatest nation on Earth. No Constitution can protect us if right doesn\\u2019t matter anymore. You know you can\\u2019t trust this president to do what\\u2019s right for this country. You can trust that he will do what\\u2019s right for Donald Trump. He\\u2019ll do it now. He\\u2019ll do it for the next several months. He\\u2019ll do it in the election if he\\u2019s allowed to. This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Democrat from California has repeatedly praised Vindman and others for \\u201csticking their necks out\\u201d to answer questions about the president\\u2019s alleged Ukraine coercion campaign when his former bosses, including ex-national security adviser John Bolton, refused to come before the House. \\u201cI have such admiration for the fact they did,\\u201d Schiff said on Wednesday. \\u201cBut what would really vindicate that leap of faith \\u2026 is if we show the same courage. They risked everything\\u2014their careers\\u2014and, yes, I know what you are asked to decide may risk yours too, but if they could show the courage, so can we.\\u201d\\n\\nOver the course of several hours earlier in the afternoon, Schiff had laid out 10 separate arguments for why Trump\\u2019s push to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden was intended for the president\\u2019s personal benefit and not to advance the national interest. \\u201cWhen we\\u2019re done, we believe that we will have made the case overwhelmingly that the president is guilty,\\u201d Schiff said. \\u201cIs there really any doubt about this? I mean, do we really have any doubt about the facts here? Does anybody really question whether the president is capable of what he\\u2019s charged with? No one is really making the argument Donald Trump would never do such a thing \\u2026 because, of course, we know that he would.\\u201d\\n\\nVindman remains assigned to the White House, something that has drawn the continuing ire of pro-Trump commentators. Schiff thanked senators last night for \\u201ckeeping an open mind about all of the issues we are presenting.\\u201d But, after Schiff spoke, Senate Republican leaders privately expressed growing confidence that they can win the vote next week to block additional witnesses from being summoned to testify. It\\u2019s not clear whether Schiff\\u2019s calls for courage have pushed any Republican senators toward breaking with the president and their party leaders on the key votes coming up next week surrounding summoning witnesses or subpoenaing documents.\\n\\n-- Schiff spoke a few hours after Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), one of the jurors, questioned Vindman\\u2019s patriotism by propagating an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory from the fever swamps of the dark corners of the pro-Trump fringe Internet. Blackburn claimed that Vindman once badmouthed the United States to Russians while serving overseas. \\u201cAdam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot,\\u201d she tweeted. \\u201cHow patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America\\u2019s greatest enemy?\\u201d\\n\\nVindman\\u2019s lawyer, former ambassador David Pressman, accused Blackburn of defaming his client. \\u201cThat a member of the Senate \\u2014 at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility \\u2014 would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice,\\u201d Pressman emailed. \\u201cWhile Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\\u201d\\n\\nBlackburn isn\\u2019t backing down and tweeted another attack around 8 p.m. Trump himself retweeted her this morning. The senator, who won Bob Corker's seat after he retired in 2018, has also accused Vindman of being a \\u201chandler\\u201d for the whistleblower who filed the complaint. Vindman testified before Schiff\\u2019s committee that he spoke with an intelligence community official about Trump\\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he declined to identify the official on the advice of counsel because he said he didn\\u2019t want to blow someone\\u2019s cover. But no public evidence exists that he was a source for the whistleblower.\\n\\n-- Schiff, a mild-mannered former federal prosecutor, has emerged as a surprisingly polarizing figure. Perhaps it\\u2019s because the president has accused him of committing treason, in addition to calling him \\u201cpencil neck\\u201d and \\u201cliddle.\\u201d Trump has now tweeted about Schiff hundreds of times. Schiff\\u2019s boosters say the right only loathes him because he\\u2019s so effective.\\n\\n-- The president\\u2019s allies at Fox News have elevated Schiff this week into perhaps the biggest boogeyman for their audience. Arguably he\\u2019s a bigger target of their vitriol right now than Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders or even the four minority women in the Squad. If you\\u2019ve watched the network for even a few minutes this week, especially in primetime, you\\u2019ve probably seen hosts and guests attacking the man from Burbank.\\n\\nTucker Carlson continued his mockery last night of the man he\\u2019s taken to calling \\u201cSaint Adam,\\u201d a nickname intended to convey what he portrays as the congressman\\u2019s sanctimoniousness. \\u201cSay what you will, but as a piece of theater, it had literally everything,\\u201d Carlson said after playing a video clip of Schiff talking on the Senate floor about how Trump\\u2019s approach to Ukraine has played into Russian President Vladimir Putin\\u2019s hands.\\n\\n\\u201cThey accused us of doing nefarious things with this Lev Parnas character,\\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told Sean Hannity. \\u201cThe truth is Adam Schiff and the Democrats have been doing nefarious things with Parnas!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAdam's ordinarily not that stupid, but when you tell the jury, the Senate, on one day that they're corrupt, and then you tell the American people they cannot be trusted to pick the commander in chief, that's just a wildly stupid trial strategy,\\u201d former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told Bret Baier.\\n\\n-- Rudy Giuliani appeared on \\u201cFox & Friends\\u201d this morning to attack the Democratic managers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a complete show on the part of the Democrats, and they should be sued for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and they should pay for that hearing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to present over the next two to three weeks shocking crimes at the highest levels of both governments while the Senate is listening to a totally phony group of stories about non-impeachable offenses.\\u201d\\n\\nGiuliani has been promising for a while now to release said evidence. It has not been forthcoming, so take such claims with more than a grain of salt. The president\\u2019s lawyer also said for months that he was going to release a lengthy report rebutting former special counsel Bob Mueller\\u2019s findings on Russian interference and whether Trump obstructed justice. He never did.\\n\\n-- Meanwhile, thought leaders on the left have effusively praised Schiff's performance. Esquire\\u2019s Charlie Pierce calls Schiff the Daniel Webster of our time. Walter Dellinger, who was acting U.S. solicitor general under Bill Clinton, said Schiff offered \\u201cone of the most impressive performances by a lawyer I have ever seen.\\u201d MSNBC legal commentator Jason Johnson called Schiff\\u2019s opening statement on Wednesday \\u201ca speech that kids will be giving in 2060 at university projects.\\u201d Actress and activist Alyssa Milano, who has been attending the trial, said \\u201cit felt like you were watching a one-man show on Broadway.\\u201d\\n\\nStephen Colbert offered an early valentine to Schiff during his show. \\u201cIt was gratifying to see someone taking the constitutional responsibility of their office seriously,\\u201d the comedian told his viewers on CBS. Breaking out of character, he said that Schiff spoke \\u201cclearly, passionately, cogently, and, I believe, courageously.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Schiff \\u201cwell spoken\\u201d and said \\u201cdid a good job of creating a tapestry.\\u201d But other Republican senators have told reporters that Schiff was overly \\u201csmooth\\u201d or \\u201cslick,\\u201d which they meant as negatives. \\u201cIn a way I do feel like I\\u2019m introducing myself to a number of the senators,\\u201d Schiff told the Associated Press, adding that they\\u2019re \\u201cfinding I\\u2019m not the demon that I\\u2019m portrayed as on Fox.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope that four Republicans still might be persuaded to vote for witnesses. \\u201cJust about every Republican\\u2019s eyes were glued on Mr. Schiff,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a powerful rendition.\\u201d\\n\\n-- All eyes are on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). \\u201cPrivately, senior Senate Republicans expect the vote to seek witness testimony to fail, but they are watching Alexander and several other Republicans closely. And wherever Alexander comes down is almost sure to be the majority position in the Senate,\\u201d Politico reports. \\u201cHe's a retiring defender of the Senate as an institution who's occasionally bucked his party, but he also counts Mitch McConnell as a longtime ally. He's more hesitant to criticize Trump than are some other Republicans, but he also has said it was \\u2018inappropriate\\u2019 for Trump to ask foreign governments to investigate his political opponents. \\u2026 [Democrats] are holding out hope that Alexander will be their hero in the mold of the late Sen. John McCain, whose extraordinary vote derailed the GOP\\u2019s effort to repeal Obamacare.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump is keeping his distance from the Republicans who might vote to call witnesses after White House advisers warned the president that outreach wouldn\\u2019t help his cause. Democrats are also giving them space. Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report: \\u201cDemocrats say there is no serious effort to privately lobby the Republicans, with the party relying instead on public opinion and the House prosecutors to squeeze them into breaking ranks.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) played with blue and purple fidget spinners. These are popular toys for children. In contrast, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who will potentially cast decisive votes on witnesses, almost never moved from their second-row desks. \\u201cCollins is a furious note taker, while Murkowski just stares intensely at the speaker,\\u201d Paul Kane reports.\\n\\n-- Collins sent a handwritten note to Roberts before his admonishment of the lawyers for both sides in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The senior senator for Maine, facing a tough reelection fight, told WCSH-TV in her state that the debate had become \\u201ctoo personal,\\u201d and she said she got mad when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Senate Republicans of being part of a coverup. \\u201cI had heard both sides impugn the integrity of one another and also cast aspersions on the Senate,\\u201d Collins said. \\u201cThat is just not appropriate.\\u201d Collins said she\\u2019s undecided on witnesses but added that the Nadler comments won\\u2019t affect her decision.\\n\\n-- Fresh polling shows most Americans overwhelmingly think witnesses should testify. An AP-NORC poll shows that 7 in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his top aides to appear before the Senate, including most Republicans. The same survey found that 45 percent think Trump should be convicted, 40 percent said he should not be and 14 percent said they don\\u2019t know enough to have an opinion.\\n\\n-- But, but, but: \\u201cMitch McConnell doesn\\u2019t care what you think,\\u201d Ben Terris writes in a new profile of the majority leader. \\u201cHe just wants to win.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A growing number of Republican senators are pointing to Trump's threat to invoke executive privilege as an excuse to vote against even trying to call witnesses, CNN reports: \\u201cGOP senators are privately and publicly raising concerns that issuing subpoenas -- to top officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton and for documents blocked by the White House -- will only serve to drag out the proceedings. Plus, many say there's little appetite for such a time-consuming fight, given that legal battles may ultimately not be successful and could force the courts to rule on hugely consequential constitutional issues about the separation of powers between the branches of government.\\u201d\\n\\nMORE FROM THE TRIAL:\\n\\n-- Democrats used a significant chunk of time on Thursday to preemptively defend the Bidens, who they expect Trump\\u2019s lawyers to attack when they get the floor: \\u201cRep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine,\\u201d Seung Min Kim, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. \\u201cBut Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump\\u2019s defense team. \\u2026 Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn\\u2019t focus on Biden\\u2019s actions toward Ukraine until 2019 \\u2026 She also referenced a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \\u2026 and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden\\u2019s desire to see [prosecutor Viktor] Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy \\u2026 As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cBefore the trial officially began Thursday afternoon, dozens of senators from both parties entered a secure facility in the Senate basement to view a classified document provided by Jennifer Williams, a national security adviser to Vice President Pence. \\u2026 The document had been previously submitted to the House Intelligence Committee. Some senators spent only a few minutes in the facility; others stayed for the better part of an hour. Several Democrats emerged to say they didn\\u2019t understand why the document had been classified. \\u2018I don\\u2019t believe it\\u2019s being withheld from the public for national security reasons. It may be withheld for political security reasons,\\u2019 said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).\\u201d\\n\\n-- The favorite talking point for most Senate Republicans continues to be that they\\u2019re learning nothing new because House managers are repeating themselves. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters during last night\\u2019s dinner break that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day in the Senate.\\u201d Ironically, he had repeated throughout the day that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day.\\u201d He said the same thing to CNN in the morning.\\n\\n\\u201cFor them to say they\\u2019re bored, it has a lot to do with them not wanting to hear evidence,\\u201d countered Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \\u201cThey don\\u2019t want to hear that this president who they\\u2019re so busy supporting did these things. As I put it, the truth hurts.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Tomorrow\\u2019s timing: Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) tells reporters that Saturday\\u2019s session will likely start and end earlier than the past few days. Party leaders are still trying to negotiate a deal to start the day as early as 8 a.m. so they can wrap up by noon. This would allow Democratic presidential candidates to fly to Iowa for campaign events. The trial has started at 1 p.m. during the week so that Chief Justice John Roberts can participate in pre-scheduled Supreme Court oral arguments before crossing the street to preside over the trial in the Capitol.\\n\\n-- Pelosi may be half a world away from the Senate floor, but that doesn\\u2019t mean the speaker doesn\\u2019t have the trial under control. From the Times: \\u201cEven in her absence from the Capitol this week, as the speaker traveled through Poland and Israel \\u2026 she had her hand firmly on the tiller. \\u2026 In many ways, Ms. Pelosi is the eighth, largely unseen manager of the Democrats\\u2019 case. \\u2026 Ms. Pelosi has dispatched her handpicked House general counsel to sit at the table inside the Senate chamber, with the prosecutors acting as her eyes and ears. She reviewed all the managers\\u2019 written briefs before they were filed.\\\"\\n\\n-- A core argument from Democrats yesterday was that the framers didn\\u2019t believe a president needed to break the law in order to warrant impeachment. \\u201cThe Constitution is not a suicide pact,\\u201d said Nadler, one of the managers. \\u201cIt does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The House\\u2019s lawyers filed a motion with an appeals court last night that says Trump\\u2019s defense lawyers have contradicted, and therefore undermined, the Department of Justice\\u2019s position on subpoenas. Ann Marimow reports: \\u201cThe lawyers for [Pelosi] asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to rule quickly on the pair of separation-of-powers cases, which they said could affect the Senate proceedings. House Democrats went to court seeking testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn and access to secret grand jury evidence from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\\u2019s Russia investigation. Justice Department attorneys have urged the appeals court to stay out of what they say are political disputes between Congress and the White House.\\u201d But the president\\u2019s team is now telling the Senate that these are matters more properly left to the courts.\\n\\n-- The White House also stonewalled the Government Accountability Office when the independent congressional watchdog requested information about the freeze on Ukraine aid. From Politico: \\u201cThe White House responded to the [GAO\\u2019s] inquiry with a one-page letter on Dec. 20, citing a legal memo from the Office of Management and Budget that defended the hold on military aid as necessary to ensure spending the funds wouldn't \\u2018conflict with the President's foreign policy.\\u2019 \\u2026 The correspondence is part of what led GAO to \\u2026 conclude last week that Trump's decision to withhold military aid violated federal law.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Follow the money: The documents turned over by Lev Parnas, Giuliani\\u2019s former associate, provide details about the web of dark money that helped fund Trump\\u2019s Ukrainian gambit. From Bloomberg News: \\u201cMoney flowed to Giuliani and his cohorts from home loans, friends, relative strangers and wealthy businessmen, some with interests in the gas and energy sector. It even came from a lawyer for an embattled Ukrainian energy tycoon fighting extradition to the U.S. on a conspiracy charge. \\u2026 The travel arrangements could brush up against campaign finance laws. While Giuliani [and Parnas] can volunteer as much of their time as they want for a campaign, any subsidy for such work by third parties would generally need to be reported as a contribution, and money from foreign individuals would be illegal.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dana Milbank: \\\"John Roberts comes face to face with the mess he made.\\\"\\n\\u2022 Ruth Marcus: \\u201cA more assertive John Roberts would be a bad idea.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Brenda Wineapple, author of a book on Andrew Johnson\\u2019s impeachment: \\u201cIf John Roberts is seeking a role model, let\\u2019s hope it\\u2019s not Salmon Chase.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Michael Gerson: \\u201cRepublicans aren\\u2019t serving the country, or even the president.

Sarah Ellison reports: \\u201cPouring attention on regional talk-radio hosts is a classic Trumpworld move: giving relatively unknown characters proximity to the White House has paid off with a disproportionate amount of attention and praise lavished on the president and his agenda. \\u2026 The strategy has been particularly powerful as Trump and his team have engaged in what [Steve] Bannon calls \\u2018information warfare\\u2019 over the impeachment fight...\\u201d\\n\\n-- Kamala \\\"that-little-girl-was-me\\\" Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joe Biden to boost her standing in the veepstakes. From the New York Times: \\u201cSuch a move could lift Mr. Biden\\u2019s campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris\\u2019s chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California. An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial \\u2026 She and [Biden] have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Anita Hill told an Iowa crowd last night that it\\u2019s too late for Biden to apologize for the way he mistreated and diminished her when she testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991. \\u201cThe statute of limitations for his apology is up,\\u201d Hill said in response to a question from the audience at the University of Iowa, where she gave a lecture on ending sexual harassment. \\u201cWhat are you going to do about it? What are you going to do today? Will you promise as leader of this country \\u2026 to use all of your energy to address the problem as it happened and to prevent it from happening to another generation? That\\u2019s what I want to hear. And I not only want to hear from him, I want to hear from every one of them who want to be the leader of this country.\\u201d (BuzzFeed News)\\n\\n-- Bernie Sanders asked his supporters to cool it \\u2013 but they don\\u2019t always listen. Sean Sullivan reports: \\u201cCampaign officials have been pressing surrogates and other allies not to escalate combustible disputes that have recently become more personal, ... including a tense fight with Joe Biden, a separate altercation with [Elizabeth Warren] and a renewed schism with Hillary Clinton. \\u2026 But many Sanders supporters, and even some campaign aides, are inclined to take a more aggressive approach that they say will highlight important differences. \\u2026 Some close Sanders allies acknowledged the difficulty of balancing the passions of his loyal backers, inspired by his calls for a political revolution and his staunchly liberal platform, with the need to demonstrate a broader unity.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sanders\\u2019s rise in the polls means he\\u2019ll be talking more about his electability than a revolution. While speeches he\\u2019s made over the past two weeks still feature his signature call to action, he\\u2019s spending more time explaining to voters how policies like Medicare-for-all would work in their daily lives, as well as how he could beat Trump. (Bloomberg News)\\n\\n-- One in five women doubt that a woman can win the presidency, according to a new CNN poll. What\\u2019s telling about this news is that just 9 percent of men said the same. (Eugene Scott)\\n\\n-- Mike Bloomberg may be lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, but he\\u2019s attracted the president\\u2019s obsessive attention by baiting him with constant attack ads. Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer report: \\u201cThe president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him \\u2018Mini Mike\\u2019 to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials. \\u2018It\\u2019s very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,\\u2019 said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide \\u2026 Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. \\u2026 Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on \\u2018Fox & Friends\\u2019 on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as \\u2018dopes and babies.\\u2019 Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Former top supporters of Cory Booker accused Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s campaign of \\u201cchasing ambulances.\\u201d From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cThe phone calls to Amy Nielsen came around two hours apart. It was last Monday around 12 p.m., not long after the news broke, when her phone lit up with his name. By then, Nielsen considered Cory Booker \\u2018part of [her] family.\\u2019 \\u2026 So the end of his campaign felt \\u2026 like \\u2018a death.\\u2019 \\u2026 The next call came around 2:30 p.m., this time from an unknown number. It was Pete Buttigieg, calling to seek Nielsen\\u2019s support now that her candidate had made the decision to \\u2018step aside.\\u2019 \\u2026 \\u2018It was a gut punch \\u2014 like, really? He did not \\u2018step aside\\u2019 for you,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Like, wow, that\\u2019s some nerve right there.\\u2019 Later that night, she said, Nielsen heard from one of Booker\\u2019s field organizers who said she had already been contacted by the Buttigieg campaign to go door-knock.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Twelve years ago, Buttigieg spent the final week before the 2008 caucuses in rural southwest Iowa, trying to turn out voters for Barack Obama in one of the most conservative towns in the state. Holly Bailey spoke with him about what he learned: \\u201c\\u2018This was a new experience to really talk to people like this,\\u2019 Buttigieg recalled. \\u2018And what I found was, first of all, you can\\u2019t assume where somebody is going to be. We were in an area where a lot of people weren\\u2019t Democrats to begin with, and those who were were more likely to be for [John] Edwards. But they would hear us out when we were talking about Obama. And sometimes, as you do when you go door-to-door, somebody, because you represent a presidential campaign, would just pour out everything that was on their mind, everything they were upset about.\\\"\\n\\n\\u00ad-- Early voting means that millions are already eligible to cast their ballot. From the AP: \\u201cIn Minnesota, in-person early voting began Jan. 17. Vermont\\u2019s deadline to mail out its absentee ballots was the same day. Many of the 14 Super Tuesday states will offer some form of early voting between now and mid-February.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Howard County saw a bigger swing from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 than any other in Iowa. The Wall Street Journal's John McCormick took the pulse for 2020: \\u201cRecent interviews with dozens of voters here suggest that most of Mr. Trump\\u2019s 2016 supporters ... plan to stick with him, even though some said they have grown weary of his personal behavior and trade fights. Among those who previously voted for Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, many said they are reserving judgment until they see who wins the Democratic nomination. \\u2026 What such swing voters do in 2020 will have national implications. Before Mr. Trump, Howard County hadn\\u2019t backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. It is one of the 31 counties in Iowa\\u2014the most of any state\\u2014that backed Mr. Obama twice and then switched to Mr. Trump. The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A new Iowa caucus app is sparking election security concerns. From NBC News: \\u201cThe app will be used in Iowa and Nevada by caucus managers \\u2014 local registered Democrats who sign up to organize and run the caucus process in each location \\u2014 to expedite the process, calculate and assign delegates and report results back quickly. The app will also be used in satellite voting locations across the country and overseas. But questions about the app remain unanswered, including who developed it and whether it has been subjected to independent security testing. Security experts say that the app is a potential target for early election interference, particularly since it is downloaded on to the personal phones of the caucus managers. Party officials say operational security prevents them from disclosing specifics about the app.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Big-money groups aligned with the Senate GOP raised $68.3 million in 2019, an off-year record. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \\u201cThe majority of the money raised in 2019 came in the latter half of the year, particularly in the final two months, largely driven by the House Democrats\\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The ranks of scientists are growing thin in the Trump administration. Annie Gowen, Juliet Eilperin, Ben Guarino and Andrew Ba Tran report: \\u201cDozens of government computers sit in a nondescript building [in Kansas City, Mo.], able to connect to a data model that could help farmers manage the impact of a changing climate on their crops. But no one in this federal agency would know how to access the model, or, if they did, what to do with the data. That\\u2019s because the ambitious federal researcher who created it in Washington quit rather than move when the Agriculture Department relocated his agency to an office park here last fall. He is one of hundreds of scientists across the federal government who have been forced out, sidelined or muted since President Trump took office. \\u2026 In the first two years of the Trump administration, more than 1,600 federal scientists left government, according to Office of Personnel Management employment data \\u2026 That represents a 1.5 percent drop, compared with the 8 percent increase during the same period in the Obama administration.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Justice Department conceded that it had \\u201cinsufficient\\u201d cause to continue monitoring a former Trump campaign adviser during the Russia probe. Matt Zapotosky reports: \\u201cThe concession was revealed in an order posted on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\\u2019s website. In December, according to the order, the department told the court it had come to believe that in at least two of the four applications to monitor the former adviser, Carter Page, \\u2018there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause\\u2019 to believe he was acting as a Russian agent.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Trump administration will create additional new hurdles for pregnant foreign women seeking U.S. tourist visas. The administration said it's trying to crack down on what it calls \\u201cbirth tourism,\\\" trying to reduce what conservatives call \\\"anchor babies,\\\" by instructing consular officers to assess whether women requesting tourist visas are hoping to give birth on U.S. soil, which would effectively grant their children American citizenship. Starting today, the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor visas to women hoping to travel to the country with the stated purpose of having a child. Foggy Bottom said consular officers cannot require pregnancy tests to make the determination but wouldn\\u2019t rule out a woman\\u2019s physical appearance when making the decision, per Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti.\\n\\n-- Trump's \\\"national public health emergency\\\" declaration on the opioid crisis expired because his people at the Department of Health and Human Services forgot to renew it. An HHS spokesperson said the nine-day lapse had been corrected and blamed a clerical error. The emergency status, first announced in 2017 as a measure deemed necessary to direct more resources toward the drug overdose crisis, needs to be renewed every 90 days.

But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies. Adding to the stress, Friday marked the official start of \\u2026 when China celebrates the arrival of the new lunar year. Authorities around the country, including in the capital Beijing, have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the holiday to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could be spread. \\u2026The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was already entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice.

A total of 8,420 were reported to be under observation. South Korean authorities confirmed Friday that a second person tested positive for the new coronavirus. \\u2026 Japan also confirmed a second case, a man in his 40s from Wuhan who arrived in Japan on Sunday on a flight through Hong Kong. Other countries to have reported infections including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to a confirmed case in Washington state, Texas has reported a potential case of coronavirus in Brazos County, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The patient contracted a respiratory illness within two weeks of traveling in Wuhan and is being isolated at home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\\n\\n\\u201cSome details about the latest deaths in China have raised concerns about the virus\\u2019s spread. Until now, the vast majority of the people had been older than 60 and almost all of them had existing health conditions. All of them had been in Hubei province \\u2026 But the latest announcement said that 36-year-old man from Wuhan, identified only by his family name, Li, died on Thursday. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions, and had been treated with anti-virus medication and antibiotics since being admitted to a hospital on Jan. 9.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Wall Street stumbled yesterday amid fears that efforts to curtail the virus could further disrupt the global economy.

(Meagan Flynn)\\n\\n-- Trump\\u2019s sanctions on Iran are fueling a new refugee crisis \\u2013 in Turkey. Erin Cunningham and Mohammad Mahdi Sultani report: \\u201cDecades ago, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted thousands of people to flee to neighboring Iran. Now, many of these refugees are once again seeking a new home in a new land, Turkey, desperate to escape the dire economic conditions fueled by U.S. sanctions on Tehran. \\u2026 Turkish authorities are grappling with nearly 4 million refugees. This is the world\\u2019s largest population of displaced people, according to the United Nations, including more than 170,000 registered Afghan refugees. Turkey has struggled to contain the influx even as aid agencies say the number of arrivals from Iran is on the rise.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A critic of the Saudi Arabian government said a suspected Saudi agent tried to kidnap him on U.S. soil, a claim backed up by multiple U.S. and foreign sources familiar with the episode. From the Daily Beast: \\u201cAbdulrahman Almutairi is a 27-year-old comedian and former student at the University of San Diego with a big social-media presence. After Almutairi used social media to criticize the powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman over the October 2018 murder and dismemberment of Washington Post contributor [Jamal] Khashoggi, an unidentified Saudi man accompanied Almutairi\\u2019s father on a flight to collect Almutairi against his will and bring him back to Saudi Arabia...\\\"\\n\\n-- The Trump administration has missed the deadline, established by law, to turn over to Congress an unclassified report on Khashoggi's murder and the role played by the regime in Riyadh. From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cIn December, lawmakers passed a sweeping defense bill that included a provision ordering the director of national intelligence to send Congress an unclassified report identifying those responsible for Khashoggi\\u2019s death at a Saudi Arabian consulate in 2018. The legislation set the deadline for the report at 30 days, which passed earlier this week.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A small team of FBI agents spent years trying to solve a stubborn mystery \\u2013 whether officials from Saudi Arabia were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. A team of ProPublica and NYT Magazine reporters tell their story: \\u201cThe FBI has disputed the idea that foreign-policy considerations significantly influenced its investigation. In interviews, current and former bureau officials and federal prosecutors insisted to us that they never would have hesitated to pursue any Saudi who could have been solidly linked to the 9/11 plot \\u2026 But others who worked on the matter, including some at the FBI\\u2019s highest levels, say that the United States\\u2019 complex and often-troubled relationship with the Saudi regime was an unavoidable fact throughout their investigations. Even as the Saudi authorities became more cooperative with the United States in fighting al-Qaida after 2003, they were minimally and grudgingly helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry. According to current and former officials, requests for assistance that might rattle the Saudi security agencies were frequently balanced against FBI and CIA needs for Saudi help against continuing terror threats.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival, Benny Gantz, next week to discuss his Middle East peace plan.

Col. Alexander Vindman as the model of courage that Senate Republicans should follow during President Trump's trial.\\n\\nThe House Intelligence chairman fought back emotion late last night as he recalled Vindman\\u2019s November appearance before his committee. Vindman was born in the Soviet Union, but his father brought him here when he was a young boy. The director of European Affairs on the National Security Council, who received a Purple Heart after he was injured in Iraq, said that his father worried when he told him he would testify. But he reassured him. \\u201cThis is America,\\u201d Vindman recalled telling his dad. \\u201cHere, right matters.\\u201d The audience broke into spontaneous applause.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, right is supposed to matter,\\u201d Schiff told senators last night in the 10 p.m. hour, wrapping up day two of his case against Trump, which he will conclude Friday afternoon. \\u201cIt\\u2019s what\\u2019s made us the greatest nation on Earth. No Constitution can protect us if right doesn\\u2019t matter anymore. You know you can\\u2019t trust this president to do what\\u2019s right for this country. You can trust that he will do what\\u2019s right for Donald Trump. He\\u2019ll do it now. He\\u2019ll do it for the next several months. He\\u2019ll do it in the election if he\\u2019s allowed to. This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Democrat from California has repeatedly praised Vindman and others for \\u201csticking their necks out\\u201d to answer questions about the president\\u2019s alleged Ukraine coercion campaign when his former bosses, including ex-national security adviser John Bolton, refused to come before the House. \\u201cI have such admiration for the fact they did,\\u201d Schiff said on Wednesday. \\u201cBut what would really vindicate that leap of faith \\u2026 is if we show the same courage. They risked everything\\u2014their careers\\u2014and, yes, I know what you are asked to decide may risk yours too, but if they could show the courage, so can we.\\u201d\\n\\nOver the course of several hours earlier in the afternoon, Schiff had laid out 10 separate arguments for why Trump\\u2019s push to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden was intended for the president\\u2019s personal benefit and not to advance the national interest. \\u201cWhen we\\u2019re done, we believe that we will have made the case overwhelmingly that the president is guilty,\\u201d Schiff said. \\u201cIs there really any doubt about this? I mean, do we really have any doubt about the facts here? Does anybody really question whether the president is capable of what he\\u2019s charged with? No one is really making the argument Donald Trump would never do such a thing \\u2026 because, of course, we know that he would.\\u201d\\n\\nVindman remains assigned to the White House, something that has drawn the continuing ire of pro-Trump commentators. Schiff thanked senators last night for \\u201ckeeping an open mind about all of the issues we are presenting.\\u201d But, after Schiff spoke, Senate Republican leaders privately expressed growing confidence that they can win the vote next week to block additional witnesses from being summoned to testify. It\\u2019s not clear whether Schiff\\u2019s calls for courage have pushed any Republican senators toward breaking with the president and their party leaders on the key votes coming up next week surrounding summoning witnesses or subpoenaing documents.\\n\\n-- Schiff spoke a few hours after Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), one of the jurors, questioned Vindman\\u2019s patriotism by propagating an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory from the fever swamps of the dark corners of the pro-Trump fringe Internet. Blackburn claimed that Vindman once badmouthed the United States to Russians while serving overseas. \\u201cAdam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot,\\u201d she tweeted. \\u201cHow patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America\\u2019s greatest enemy?\\u201d\\n\\nVindman\\u2019s lawyer, former ambassador David Pressman, accused Blackburn of defaming his client. \\u201cThat a member of the Senate \\u2014 at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility \\u2014 would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice,\\u201d Pressman emailed. \\u201cWhile Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\\u201d\\n\\nBlackburn isn\\u2019t backing down and tweeted another attack around 8 p.m. Trump himself retweeted her this morning. The senator, who won Bob Corker's seat after he retired in 2018, has also accused Vindman of being a \\u201chandler\\u201d for the whistleblower who filed the complaint. Vindman testified before Schiff\\u2019s committee that he spoke with an intelligence community official about Trump\\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he declined to identify the official on the advice of counsel because he said he didn\\u2019t want to blow someone\\u2019s cover. But no public evidence exists that he was a source for the whistleblower.\\n\\n-- Schiff, a mild-mannered former federal prosecutor, has emerged as a surprisingly polarizing figure. Perhaps it\\u2019s because the president has accused him of committing treason, in addition to calling him \\u201cpencil neck\\u201d and \\u201cliddle.\\u201d Trump has now tweeted about Schiff hundreds of times. Schiff\\u2019s boosters say the right only loathes him because he\\u2019s so effective.\\n\\n-- The president\\u2019s allies at Fox News have elevated Schiff this week into perhaps the biggest boogeyman for their audience. Arguably he\\u2019s a bigger target of their vitriol right now than Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders or even the four minority women in the Squad. If you\\u2019ve watched the network for even a few minutes this week, especially in primetime, you\\u2019ve probably seen hosts and guests attacking the man from Burbank.\\n\\nTucker Carlson continued his mockery last night of the man he\\u2019s taken to calling \\u201cSaint Adam,\\u201d a nickname intended to convey what he portrays as the congressman\\u2019s sanctimoniousness. \\u201cSay what you will, but as a piece of theater, it had literally everything,\\u201d Carlson said after playing a video clip of Schiff talking on the Senate floor about how Trump\\u2019s approach to Ukraine has played into Russian President Vladimir Putin\\u2019s hands.\\n\\n\\u201cThey accused us of doing nefarious things with this Lev Parnas character,\\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told Sean Hannity. \\u201cThe truth is Adam Schiff and the Democrats have been doing nefarious things with Parnas!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAdam's ordinarily not that stupid, but when you tell the jury, the Senate, on one day that they're corrupt, and then you tell the American people they cannot be trusted to pick the commander in chief, that's just a wildly stupid trial strategy,\\u201d former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told Bret Baier.\\n\\n-- Rudy Giuliani appeared on \\u201cFox & Friends\\u201d this morning to attack the Democratic managers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a complete show on the part of the Democrats, and they should be sued for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and they should pay for that hearing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to present over the next two to three weeks shocking crimes at the highest levels of both governments while the Senate is listening to a totally phony group of stories about non-impeachable offenses.\\u201d\\n\\nGiuliani has been promising for a while now to release said evidence. It has not been forthcoming, so take such claims with more than a grain of salt. The president\\u2019s lawyer also said for months that he was going to release a lengthy report rebutting former special counsel Bob Mueller\\u2019s findings on Russian interference and whether Trump obstructed justice. He never did.\\n\\n-- Meanwhile, thought leaders on the left have effusively praised Schiff's performance. Esquire\\u2019s Charlie Pierce calls Schiff the Daniel Webster of our time. Walter Dellinger, who was acting U.S. solicitor general under Bill Clinton, said Schiff offered \\u201cone of the most impressive performances by a lawyer I have ever seen.\\u201d MSNBC legal commentator Jason Johnson called Schiff\\u2019s opening statement on Wednesday \\u201ca speech that kids will be giving in 2060 at university projects.\\u201d Actress and activist Alyssa Milano, who has been attending the trial, said \\u201cit felt like you were watching a one-man show on Broadway.\\u201d\\n\\nStephen Colbert offered an early valentine to Schiff during his show. \\u201cIt was gratifying to see someone taking the constitutional responsibility of their office seriously,\\u201d the comedian told his viewers on CBS. Breaking out of character, he said that Schiff spoke \\u201cclearly, passionately, cogently, and, I believe, courageously.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Schiff \\u201cwell spoken\\u201d and said \\u201cdid a good job of creating a tapestry.\\u201d But other Republican senators have told reporters that Schiff was overly \\u201csmooth\\u201d or \\u201cslick,\\u201d which they meant as negatives. \\u201cIn a way I do feel like I\\u2019m introducing myself to a number of the senators,\\u201d Schiff told the Associated Press, adding that they\\u2019re \\u201cfinding I\\u2019m not the demon that I\\u2019m portrayed as on Fox.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope that four Republicans still might be persuaded to vote for witnesses. \\u201cJust about every Republican\\u2019s eyes were glued on Mr. Schiff,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a powerful rendition.\\u201d\\n\\n-- All eyes are on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). \\u201cPrivately, senior Senate Republicans expect the vote to seek witness testimony to fail, but they are watching Alexander and several other Republicans closely. And wherever Alexander comes down is almost sure to be the majority position in the Senate,\\u201d Politico reports. \\u201cHe's a retiring defender of the Senate as an institution who's occasionally bucked his party, but he also counts Mitch McConnell as a longtime ally. He's more hesitant to criticize Trump than are some other Republicans, but he also has said it was \\u2018inappropriate\\u2019 for Trump to ask foreign governments to investigate his political opponents. \\u2026 [Democrats] are holding out hope that Alexander will be their hero in the mold of the late Sen. John McCain, whose extraordinary vote derailed the GOP\\u2019s effort to repeal Obamacare.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump is keeping his distance from the Republicans who might vote to call witnesses after White House advisers warned the president that outreach wouldn\\u2019t help his cause. Democrats are also giving them space. Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report: \\u201cDemocrats say there is no serious effort to privately lobby the Republicans, with the party relying instead on public opinion and the House prosecutors to squeeze them into breaking ranks.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) played with blue and purple fidget spinners. These are popular toys for children. In contrast, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who will potentially cast decisive votes on witnesses, almost never moved from their second-row desks. \\u201cCollins is a furious note taker, while Murkowski just stares intensely at the speaker,\\u201d Paul Kane reports.\\n\\n-- Collins sent a handwritten note to Roberts before his admonishment of the lawyers for both sides in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The senior senator for Maine, facing a tough reelection fight, told WCSH-TV in her state that the debate had become \\u201ctoo personal,\\u201d and she said she got mad when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Senate Republicans of being part of a coverup. \\u201cI had heard both sides impugn the integrity of one another and also cast aspersions on the Senate,\\u201d Collins said. \\u201cThat is just not appropriate.\\u201d Collins said she\\u2019s undecided on witnesses but added that the Nadler comments won\\u2019t affect her decision.\\n\\n-- Fresh polling shows most Americans overwhelmingly think witnesses should testify. An AP-NORC poll shows that 7 in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his top aides to appear before the Senate, including most Republicans. The same survey found that 45 percent think Trump should be convicted, 40 percent said he should not be and 14 percent said they don\\u2019t know enough to have an opinion.\\n\\n-- But, but, but: \\u201cMitch McConnell doesn\\u2019t care what you think,\\u201d Ben Terris writes in a new profile of the majority leader. \\u201cHe just wants to win.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A growing number of Republican senators are pointing to Trump's threat to invoke executive privilege as an excuse to vote against even trying to call witnesses, CNN reports: \\u201cGOP senators are privately and publicly raising concerns that issuing subpoenas -- to top officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton and for documents blocked by the White House -- will only serve to drag out the proceedings. Plus, many say there's little appetite for such a time-consuming fight, given that legal battles may ultimately not be successful and could force the courts to rule on hugely consequential constitutional issues about the separation of powers between the branches of government.\\u201d\\n\\nMORE FROM THE TRIAL:\\n\\n-- Democrats used a significant chunk of time on Thursday to preemptively defend the Bidens, who they expect Trump\\u2019s lawyers to attack when they get the floor: \\u201cRep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine,\\u201d Seung Min Kim, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. \\u201cBut Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump\\u2019s defense team. \\u2026 Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn\\u2019t focus on Biden\\u2019s actions toward Ukraine until 2019 \\u2026 She also referenced a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \\u2026 and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden\\u2019s desire to see [prosecutor Viktor] Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy \\u2026 As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cBefore the trial officially began Thursday afternoon, dozens of senators from both parties entered a secure facility in the Senate basement to view a classified document provided by Jennifer Williams, a national security adviser to Vice President Pence. \\u2026 The document had been previously submitted to the House Intelligence Committee. Some senators spent only a few minutes in the facility; others stayed for the better part of an hour. Several Democrats emerged to say they didn\\u2019t understand why the document had been classified. \\u2018I don\\u2019t believe it\\u2019s being withheld from the public for national security reasons. It may be withheld for political security reasons,\\u2019 said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).\\u201d\\n\\n-- The favorite talking point for most Senate Republicans continues to be that they\\u2019re learning nothing new because House managers are repeating themselves. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters during last night\\u2019s dinner break that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day in the Senate.\\u201d Ironically, he had repeated throughout the day that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day.\\u201d He said the same thing to CNN in the morning.\\n\\n\\u201cFor them to say they\\u2019re bored, it has a lot to do with them not wanting to hear evidence,\\u201d countered Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \\u201cThey don\\u2019t want to hear that this president who they\\u2019re so busy supporting did these things. As I put it, the truth hurts.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Tomorrow\\u2019s timing: Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) tells reporters that Saturday\\u2019s session will likely start and end earlier than the past few days. Party leaders are still trying to negotiate a deal to start the day as early as 8 a.m. so they can wrap up by noon. This would allow Democratic presidential candidates to fly to Iowa for campaign events. The trial has started at 1 p.m. during the week so that Chief Justice John Roberts can participate in pre-scheduled Supreme Court oral arguments before crossing the street to preside over the trial in the Capitol.\\n\\n-- Pelosi may be half a world away from the Senate floor, but that doesn\\u2019t mean the speaker doesn\\u2019t have the trial under control. From the Times: \\u201cEven in her absence from the Capitol this week, as the speaker traveled through Poland and Israel \\u2026 she had her hand firmly on the tiller. \\u2026 In many ways, Ms. Pelosi is the eighth, largely unseen manager of the Democrats\\u2019 case. \\u2026 Ms. Pelosi has dispatched her handpicked House general counsel to sit at the table inside the Senate chamber, with the prosecutors acting as her eyes and ears. She reviewed all the managers\\u2019 written briefs before they were filed.\\\"\\n\\n-- A core argument from Democrats yesterday was that the framers didn\\u2019t believe a president needed to break the law in order to warrant impeachment. \\u201cThe Constitution is not a suicide pact,\\u201d said Nadler, one of the managers. \\u201cIt does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The House\\u2019s lawyers filed a motion with an appeals court last night that says Trump\\u2019s defense lawyers have contradicted, and therefore undermined, the Department of Justice\\u2019s position on subpoenas. Ann Marimow reports: \\u201cThe lawyers for [Pelosi] asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to rule quickly on the pair of separation-of-powers cases, which they said could affect the Senate proceedings. House Democrats went to court seeking testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn and access to secret grand jury evidence from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\\u2019s Russia investigation. Justice Department attorneys have urged the appeals court to stay out of what they say are political disputes between Congress and the White House.\\u201d But the president\\u2019s team is now telling the Senate that these are matters more properly left to the courts.\\n\\n-- The White House also stonewalled the Government Accountability Office when the independent congressional watchdog requested information about the freeze on Ukraine aid. From Politico: \\u201cThe White House responded to the [GAO\\u2019s] inquiry with a one-page letter on Dec. 20, citing a legal memo from the Office of Management and Budget that defended the hold on military aid as necessary to ensure spending the funds wouldn't \\u2018conflict with the President's foreign policy.\\u2019 \\u2026 The correspondence is part of what led GAO to \\u2026 conclude last week that Trump's decision to withhold military aid violated federal law.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Follow the money: The documents turned over by Lev Parnas, Giuliani\\u2019s former associate, provide details about the web of dark money that helped fund Trump\\u2019s Ukrainian gambit. From Bloomberg News: \\u201cMoney flowed to Giuliani and his cohorts from home loans, friends, relative strangers and wealthy businessmen, some with interests in the gas and energy sector. It even came from a lawyer for an embattled Ukrainian energy tycoon fighting extradition to the U.S. on a conspiracy charge. \\u2026 The travel arrangements could brush up against campaign finance laws. While Giuliani [and Parnas] can volunteer as much of their time as they want for a campaign, any subsidy for such work by third parties would generally need to be reported as a contribution, and money from foreign individuals would be illegal.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dana Milbank: \\\"John Roberts comes face to face with the mess he made.\\\"\\n\\u2022 Ruth Marcus: \\u201cA more assertive John Roberts would be a bad idea.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Brenda Wineapple, author of a book on Andrew Johnson\\u2019s impeachment: \\u201cIf John Roberts is seeking a role model, let\\u2019s hope it\\u2019s not Salmon Chase.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Michael Gerson: \\u201cRepublicans aren\\u2019t serving the country, or even the president.

Sarah Ellison reports: \\u201cPouring attention on regional talk-radio hosts is a classic Trumpworld move: giving relatively unknown characters proximity to the White House has paid off with a disproportionate amount of attention and praise lavished on the president and his agenda. \\u2026 The strategy has been particularly powerful as Trump and his team have engaged in what [Steve] Bannon calls \\u2018information warfare\\u2019 over the impeachment fight...\\u201d\\n\\n-- Kamala \\\"that-little-girl-was-me\\\" Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joe Biden to boost her standing in the veepstakes. From the New York Times: \\u201cSuch a move could lift Mr. Biden\\u2019s campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris\\u2019s chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California. An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial \\u2026 She and [Biden] have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Anita Hill told an Iowa crowd last night that it\\u2019s too late for Biden to apologize for the way he mistreated and diminished her when she testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991. \\u201cThe statute of limitations for his apology is up,\\u201d Hill said in response to a question from the audience at the University of Iowa, where she gave a lecture on ending sexual harassment. \\u201cWhat are you going to do about it? What are you going to do today? Will you promise as leader of this country \\u2026 to use all of your energy to address the problem as it happened and to prevent it from happening to another generation? That\\u2019s what I want to hear. And I not only want to hear from him, I want to hear from every one of them who want to be the leader of this country.\\u201d (BuzzFeed News)\\n\\n-- Bernie Sanders asked his supporters to cool it \\u2013 but they don\\u2019t always listen. Sean Sullivan reports: \\u201cCampaign officials have been pressing surrogates and other allies not to escalate combustible disputes that have recently become more personal, ... including a tense fight with Joe Biden, a separate altercation with [Elizabeth Warren] and a renewed schism with Hillary Clinton. \\u2026 But many Sanders supporters, and even some campaign aides, are inclined to take a more aggressive approach that they say will highlight important differences. \\u2026 Some close Sanders allies acknowledged the difficulty of balancing the passions of his loyal backers, inspired by his calls for a political revolution and his staunchly liberal platform, with the need to demonstrate a broader unity.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sanders\\u2019s rise in the polls means he\\u2019ll be talking more about his electability than a revolution. While speeches he\\u2019s made over the past two weeks still feature his signature call to action, he\\u2019s spending more time explaining to voters how policies like Medicare-for-all would work in their daily lives, as well as how he could beat Trump. (Bloomberg News)\\n\\n-- One in five women doubt that a woman can win the presidency, according to a new CNN poll. What\\u2019s telling about this news is that just 9 percent of men said the same. (Eugene Scott)\\n\\n-- Mike Bloomberg may be lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, but he\\u2019s attracted the president\\u2019s obsessive attention by baiting him with constant attack ads. Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer report: \\u201cThe president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him \\u2018Mini Mike\\u2019 to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials. \\u2018It\\u2019s very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,\\u2019 said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide \\u2026 Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. \\u2026 Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on \\u2018Fox & Friends\\u2019 on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as \\u2018dopes and babies.\\u2019 Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Former top supporters of Cory Booker accused Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s campaign of \\u201cchasing ambulances.\\u201d From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cThe phone calls to Amy Nielsen came around two hours apart. It was last Monday around 12 p.m., not long after the news broke, when her phone lit up with his name. By then, Nielsen considered Cory Booker \\u2018part of [her] family.\\u2019 \\u2026 So the end of his campaign felt \\u2026 like \\u2018a death.\\u2019 \\u2026 The next call came around 2:30 p.m., this time from an unknown number. It was Pete Buttigieg, calling to seek Nielsen\\u2019s support now that her candidate had made the decision to \\u2018step aside.\\u2019 \\u2026 \\u2018It was a gut punch \\u2014 like, really? He did not \\u2018step aside\\u2019 for you,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Like, wow, that\\u2019s some nerve right there.\\u2019 Later that night, she said, Nielsen heard from one of Booker\\u2019s field organizers who said she had already been contacted by the Buttigieg campaign to go door-knock.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Twelve years ago, Buttigieg spent the final week before the 2008 caucuses in rural southwest Iowa, trying to turn out voters for Barack Obama in one of the most conservative towns in the state. Holly Bailey spoke with him about what he learned: \\u201c\\u2018This was a new experience to really talk to people like this,\\u2019 Buttigieg recalled. \\u2018And what I found was, first of all, you can\\u2019t assume where somebody is going to be. We were in an area where a lot of people weren\\u2019t Democrats to begin with, and those who were were more likely to be for [John] Edwards. But they would hear us out when we were talking about Obama. And sometimes, as you do when you go door-to-door, somebody, because you represent a presidential campaign, would just pour out everything that was on their mind, everything they were upset about.\\\"\\n\\n\\u00ad-- Early voting means that millions are already eligible to cast their ballot. From the AP: \\u201cIn Minnesota, in-person early voting began Jan. 17. Vermont\\u2019s deadline to mail out its absentee ballots was the same day. Many of the 14 Super Tuesday states will offer some form of early voting between now and mid-February.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Howard County saw a bigger swing from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 than any other in Iowa. The Wall Street Journal's John McCormick took the pulse for 2020: \\u201cRecent interviews with dozens of voters here suggest that most of Mr. Trump\\u2019s 2016 supporters ... plan to stick with him, even though some said they have grown weary of his personal behavior and trade fights. Among those who previously voted for Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, many said they are reserving judgment until they see who wins the Democratic nomination. \\u2026 What such swing voters do in 2020 will have national implications. Before Mr. Trump, Howard County hadn\\u2019t backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. It is one of the 31 counties in Iowa\\u2014the most of any state\\u2014that backed Mr. Obama twice and then switched to Mr. Trump. The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A new Iowa caucus app is sparking election security concerns. From NBC News: \\u201cThe app will be used in Iowa and Nevada by caucus managers \\u2014 local registered Democrats who sign up to organize and run the caucus process in each location \\u2014 to expedite the process, calculate and assign delegates and report results back quickly. The app will also be used in satellite voting locations across the country and overseas. But questions about the app remain unanswered, including who developed it and whether it has been subjected to independent security testing. Security experts say that the app is a potential target for early election interference, particularly since it is downloaded on to the personal phones of the caucus managers. Party officials say operational security prevents them from disclosing specifics about the app.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Big-money groups aligned with the Senate GOP raised $68.3 million in 2019, an off-year record. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \\u201cThe majority of the money raised in 2019 came in the latter half of the year, particularly in the final two months, largely driven by the House Democrats\\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The ranks of scientists are growing thin in the Trump administration. Annie Gowen, Juliet Eilperin, Ben Guarino and Andrew Ba Tran report: \\u201cDozens of government computers sit in a nondescript building [in Kansas City, Mo.], able to connect to a data model that could help farmers manage the impact of a changing climate on their crops. But no one in this federal agency would know how to access the model, or, if they did, what to do with the data. That\\u2019s because the ambitious federal researcher who created it in Washington quit rather than move when the Agriculture Department relocated his agency to an office park here last fall. He is one of hundreds of scientists across the federal government who have been forced out, sidelined or muted since President Trump took office. \\u2026 In the first two years of the Trump administration, more than 1,600 federal scientists left government, according to Office of Personnel Management employment data \\u2026 That represents a 1.5 percent drop, compared with the 8 percent increase during the same period in the Obama administration.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Justice Department conceded that it had \\u201cinsufficient\\u201d cause to continue monitoring a former Trump campaign adviser during the Russia probe. Matt Zapotosky reports: \\u201cThe concession was revealed in an order posted on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\\u2019s website. In December, according to the order, the department told the court it had come to believe that in at least two of the four applications to monitor the former adviser, Carter Page, \\u2018there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause\\u2019 to believe he was acting as a Russian agent.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Trump administration will create additional new hurdles for pregnant foreign women seeking U.S. tourist visas. The administration said it's trying to crack down on what it calls \\u201cbirth tourism,\\\" trying to reduce what conservatives call \\\"anchor babies,\\\" by instructing consular officers to assess whether women requesting tourist visas are hoping to give birth on U.S. soil, which would effectively grant their children American citizenship. Starting today, the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor visas to women hoping to travel to the country with the stated purpose of having a child. Foggy Bottom said consular officers cannot require pregnancy tests to make the determination but wouldn\\u2019t rule out a woman\\u2019s physical appearance when making the decision, per Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti.\\n\\n-- Trump's \\\"national public health emergency\\\" declaration on the opioid crisis expired because his people at the Department of Health and Human Services forgot to renew it. An HHS spokesperson said the nine-day lapse had been corrected and blamed a clerical error. The emergency status, first announced in 2017 as a measure deemed necessary to direct more resources toward the drug overdose crisis, needs to be renewed every 90 days. (Politico)\\n\\n-- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, 17, needs to study economics before offering her thoughts on climate change. Heather Long reports from Davos: \\u201cThunberg and Mnuchin are both attending the World Economic Forum this week. \\u2026 At a news conference on Thursday, Mnuchin was asked for his reaction to Thunberg\\u2019s insistence on fossil fuel divestment. \\u2018Who is she?\\u2019 he tried to joke to reporters before taking a jab at Thunberg, suggesting she didn\\u2019t understand what she was talking about. \\u2026 \\u2018Is she the chief economist or who is she? I\\u2019m confused. ...

Shayna Jacobs reports: \\u201c\\u2018I was punching him. I was kicking him. I was just trying to get him away from me, and he took my hands and put them over my head,\\u2019 Sciorra told the jury in Weinstein\\u2019s sexual assault trial, her eyes welling up with tears and her voice breaking. \\u2026 Weinstein, who had been watching her from the defense table, turned his gaze away from his accuser as she emotionally detailed the encounter. \\u2026 In her five hours of testimony, she described freezing after the attack, adding that \\u2018It was just so disgusting that my body started to shake.\\u2019 She said she had no romantic interest in Weinstein. The film producer arrived at her Manhattan apartment uninvited one night.\\u201d\\n\\n-- \\u201cA young, healthy man from Wuhan and a person living 1,500 miles from the epicenter of the coronavirus are among the latest victims of the outbreak, which has incited fear and anger across China as the important Spring Festival gets underway,\\u201d Anna Fifield reports from Beijing. \\u201cReports of eight new deaths from the pneumonia-like virus, taking the total to 26, came as authorities enforced a lockdown across large parts of the province of Hubei, population 59 million. But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies. Adding to the stress, Friday marked the official start of \\u2026 when China celebrates the arrival of the new lunar year. Authorities around the country, including in the capital Beijing, have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the holiday to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could be spread. \\u2026The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was already entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice. Production companies have postponed the release of seven blockbuster films that were to be released over the holiday, leading Chinese cinema companies to close the country\\u2019s 70,000 movie theaters. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cThe National Health Commission reported Friday that there are now more than 830 confirmed cases of infection, and reports of new cases continued to roll in from around the country: from Xinjiang in the west to Shandong in the east, from Inner Mongolia in the north to Hainan in the south. A total of 8,420 were reported to be under observation. South Korean authorities confirmed Friday that a second person tested positive for the new coronavirus. \\u2026 Japan also confirmed a second case, a man in his 40s from Wuhan who arrived in Japan on Sunday on a flight through Hong Kong. Other countries to have reported infections including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to a confirmed case in Washington state, Texas has reported a potential case of coronavirus in Brazos County, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The patient contracted a respiratory illness within two weeks of traveling in Wuhan and is being isolated at home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\\n\\n\\u201cSome details about the latest deaths in China have raised concerns about the virus\\u2019s spread. Until now, the vast majority of the people had been older than 60 and almost all of them had existing health conditions. All of them had been in Hubei province \\u2026 But the latest announcement said that 36-year-old man from Wuhan, identified only by his family name, Li, died on Thursday. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions, and had been treated with anti-virus medication and antibiotics since being admitted to a hospital on Jan. 9.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Wall Street stumbled yesterday amid fears that efforts to curtail the virus could further disrupt the global economy. (David Lynch)\\n\\n-- The U.S. has officially refused to extradite Anne Sacoolas, the diplomat\\u2019s wife who fled the U.K. to avoid facing charges for killing a British teen by driving on the wrong side of the road. A State Department spokesman said extraditing Sacoolas would \\u201cset an extraordinarily troubling precedent\\u201d but did not elaborate. (Meagan Flynn)\\n\\n-- Trump\\u2019s sanctions on Iran are fueling a new refugee crisis \\u2013 in Turkey. Erin Cunningham and Mohammad Mahdi Sultani report: \\u201cDecades ago, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted thousands of people to flee to neighboring Iran. Now, many of these refugees are once again seeking a new home in a new land, Turkey, desperate to escape the dire economic conditions fueled by U.S. sanctions on Tehran. \\u2026 Turkish authorities are grappling with nearly 4 million refugees. This is the world\\u2019s largest population of displaced people, according to the United Nations, including more than 170,000 registered Afghan refugees. Turkey has struggled to contain the influx even as aid agencies say the number of arrivals from Iran is on the rise.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A critic of the Saudi Arabian government said a suspected Saudi agent tried to kidnap him on U.S. soil, a claim backed up by multiple U.S. and foreign sources familiar with the episode. From the Daily Beast: \\u201cAbdulrahman Almutairi is a 27-year-old comedian and former student at the University of San Diego with a big social-media presence. After Almutairi used social media to criticize the powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman over the October 2018 murder and dismemberment of Washington Post contributor [Jamal] Khashoggi, an unidentified Saudi man accompanied Almutairi\\u2019s father on a flight to collect Almutairi against his will and bring him back to Saudi Arabia...\\\"\\n\\n-- The Trump administration has missed the deadline, established by law, to turn over to Congress an unclassified report on Khashoggi's murder and the role played by the regime in Riyadh. From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cIn December, lawmakers passed a sweeping defense bill that included a provision ordering the director of national intelligence to send Congress an unclassified report identifying those responsible for Khashoggi\\u2019s death at a Saudi Arabian consulate in 2018. The legislation set the deadline for the report at 30 days, which passed earlier this week.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A small team of FBI agents spent years trying to solve a stubborn mystery \\u2013 whether officials from Saudi Arabia were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. A team of ProPublica and NYT Magazine reporters tell their story: \\u201cThe FBI has disputed the idea that foreign-policy considerations significantly influenced its investigation. In interviews, current and former bureau officials and federal prosecutors insisted to us that they never would have hesitated to pursue any Saudi who could have been solidly linked to the 9/11 plot \\u2026 But others who worked on the matter, including some at the FBI\\u2019s highest levels, say that the United States\\u2019 complex and often-troubled relationship with the Saudi regime was an unavoidable fact throughout their investigations. Even as the Saudi authorities became more cooperative with the United States in fighting al-Qaida after 2003, they were minimally and grudgingly helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry. According to current and former officials, requests for assistance that might rattle the Saudi security agencies were frequently balanced against FBI and CIA needs for Saudi help against continuing terror threats.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival, Benny Gantz, next week to discuss his Middle East peace plan. The meeting comes amid Trump\\u2019s trial, as well as Netanyahu and Gantz\\u2019s own troubles at home, where they\\u2019ve both failed to form a government.

Col. Alexander Vindman as the model of courage that Senate Republicans should follow during President Trump's trial.\\n\\nThe House Intelligence chairman fought back emotion late last night as he recalled Vindman\\u2019s November appearance before his committee. Vindman was born in the Soviet Union, but his father brought him here when he was a young boy. The director of European Affairs on the National Security Council, who received a Purple Heart after he was injured in Iraq, said that his father worried when he told him he would testify. But he reassured him. \\u201cThis is America,\\u201d Vindman recalled telling his dad. \\u201cHere, right matters.\\u201d The audience broke into spontaneous applause.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, right is supposed to matter,\\u201d Schiff told senators last night in the 10 p.m. hour, wrapping up day two of his case against Trump, which he will conclude Friday afternoon. \\u201cIt\\u2019s what\\u2019s made us the greatest nation on Earth. No Constitution can protect us if right doesn\\u2019t matter anymore. You know you can\\u2019t trust this president to do what\\u2019s right for this country. You can trust that he will do what\\u2019s right for Donald Trump. He\\u2019ll do it now. He\\u2019ll do it for the next several months. He\\u2019ll do it in the election if he\\u2019s allowed to. This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Democrat from California has repeatedly praised Vindman and others for \\u201csticking their necks out\\u201d to answer questions about the president\\u2019s alleged Ukraine coercion campaign when his former bosses, including ex-national security adviser John Bolton, refused to come before the House. \\u201cI have such admiration for the fact they did,\\u201d Schiff said on Wednesday. \\u201cBut what would really vindicate that leap of faith \\u2026 is if we show the same courage. They risked everything\\u2014their careers\\u2014and, yes, I know what you are asked to decide may risk yours too, but if they could show the courage, so can we.\\u201d\\n\\nOver the course of several hours earlier in the afternoon, Schiff had laid out 10 separate arguments for why Trump\\u2019s push to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden was intended for the president\\u2019s personal benefit and not to advance the national interest. \\u201cWhen we\\u2019re done, we believe that we will have made the case overwhelmingly that the president is guilty,\\u201d Schiff said. \\u201cIs there really any doubt about this? I mean, do we really have any doubt about the facts here? Does anybody really question whether the president is capable of what he\\u2019s charged with? No one is really making the argument Donald Trump would never do such a thing \\u2026 because, of course, we know that he would.\\u201d\\n\\nVindman remains assigned to the White House, something that has drawn the continuing ire of pro-Trump commentators. Schiff thanked senators last night for \\u201ckeeping an open mind about all of the issues we are presenting.\\u201d But, after Schiff spoke, Senate Republican leaders privately expressed growing confidence that they can win the vote next week to block additional witnesses from being summoned to testify. It\\u2019s not clear whether Schiff\\u2019s calls for courage have pushed any Republican senators toward breaking with the president and their party leaders on the key votes coming up next week surrounding summoning witnesses or subpoenaing documents.\\n\\n-- Schiff spoke a few hours after Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), one of the jurors, questioned Vindman\\u2019s patriotism by propagating an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory from the fever swamps of the dark corners of the pro-Trump fringe Internet. Blackburn claimed that Vindman once badmouthed the United States to Russians while serving overseas. \\u201cAdam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot,\\u201d she tweeted. \\u201cHow patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America\\u2019s greatest enemy?\\u201d\\n\\nVindman\\u2019s lawyer, former ambassador David Pressman, accused Blackburn of defaming his client. \\u201cThat a member of the Senate \\u2014 at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility \\u2014 would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice,\\u201d Pressman emailed. \\u201cWhile Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\\u201d\\n\\nBlackburn isn\\u2019t backing down and tweeted another attack around 8 p.m. Trump himself retweeted her this morning. The senator, who won Bob Corker's seat after he retired in 2018, has also accused Vindman of being a \\u201chandler\\u201d for the whistleblower who filed the complaint. Vindman testified before Schiff\\u2019s committee that he spoke with an intelligence community official about Trump\\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he declined to identify the official on the advice of counsel because he said he didn\\u2019t want to blow someone\\u2019s cover. But no public evidence exists that he was a source for the whistleblower.\\n\\n-- Schiff, a mild-mannered former federal prosecutor, has emerged as a surprisingly polarizing figure. Perhaps it\\u2019s because the president has accused him of committing treason, in addition to calling him \\u201cpencil neck\\u201d and \\u201cliddle.\\u201d Trump has now tweeted about Schiff hundreds of times. Schiff\\u2019s boosters say the right only loathes him because he\\u2019s so effective.\\n\\n-- The president\\u2019s allies at Fox News have elevated Schiff this week into perhaps the biggest boogeyman for their audience. Arguably he\\u2019s a bigger target of their vitriol right now than Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders or even the four minority women in the Squad. If you\\u2019ve watched the network for even a few minutes this week, especially in primetime, you\\u2019ve probably seen hosts and guests attacking the man from Burbank.\\n\\nTucker Carlson continued his mockery last night of the man he\\u2019s taken to calling \\u201cSaint Adam,\\u201d a nickname intended to convey what he portrays as the congressman\\u2019s sanctimoniousness. \\u201cSay what you will, but as a piece of theater, it had literally everything,\\u201d Carlson said after playing a video clip of Schiff talking on the Senate floor about how Trump\\u2019s approach to Ukraine has played into Russian President Vladimir Putin\\u2019s hands.\\n\\n\\u201cThey accused us of doing nefarious things with this Lev Parnas character,\\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told Sean Hannity. \\u201cThe truth is Adam Schiff and the Democrats have been doing nefarious things with Parnas!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAdam's ordinarily not that stupid, but when you tell the jury, the Senate, on one day that they're corrupt, and then you tell the American people they cannot be trusted to pick the commander in chief, that's just a wildly stupid trial strategy,\\u201d former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told Bret Baier.\\n\\n-- Rudy Giuliani appeared on \\u201cFox & Friends\\u201d this morning to attack the Democratic managers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a complete show on the part of the Democrats, and they should be sued for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and they should pay for that hearing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to present over the next two to three weeks shocking crimes at the highest levels of both governments while the Senate is listening to a totally phony group of stories about non-impeachable offenses.\\u201d\\n\\nGiuliani has been promising for a while now to release said evidence. It has not been forthcoming, so take such claims with more than a grain of salt. The president\\u2019s lawyer also said for months that he was going to release a lengthy report rebutting former special counsel Bob Mueller\\u2019s findings on Russian interference and whether Trump obstructed justice. He never did.\\n\\n-- Meanwhile, thought leaders on the left have effusively praised Schiff's performance. Esquire\\u2019s Charlie Pierce calls Schiff the Daniel Webster of our time. Walter Dellinger, who was acting U.S. solicitor general under Bill Clinton, said Schiff offered \\u201cone of the most impressive performances by a lawyer I have ever seen.\\u201d MSNBC legal commentator Jason Johnson called Schiff\\u2019s opening statement on Wednesday \\u201ca speech that kids will be giving in 2060 at university projects.\\u201d Actress and activist Alyssa Milano, who has been attending the trial, said \\u201cit felt like you were watching a one-man show on Broadway.\\u201d\\n\\nStephen Colbert offered an early valentine to Schiff during his show. \\u201cIt was gratifying to see someone taking the constitutional responsibility of their office seriously,\\u201d the comedian told his viewers on CBS. Breaking out of character, he said that Schiff spoke \\u201cclearly, passionately, cogently, and, I believe, courageously.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Schiff \\u201cwell spoken\\u201d and said \\u201cdid a good job of creating a tapestry.\\u201d But other Republican senators have told reporters that Schiff was overly \\u201csmooth\\u201d or \\u201cslick,\\u201d which they meant as negatives. \\u201cIn a way I do feel like I\\u2019m introducing myself to a number of the senators,\\u201d Schiff told the Associated Press, adding that they\\u2019re \\u201cfinding I\\u2019m not the demon that I\\u2019m portrayed as on Fox.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope that four Republicans still might be persuaded to vote for witnesses. \\u201cJust about every Republican\\u2019s eyes were glued on Mr. Schiff,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a powerful rendition.\\u201d\\n\\n-- All eyes are on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). \\u201cPrivately, senior Senate Republicans expect the vote to seek witness testimony to fail, but they are watching Alexander and several other Republicans closely. And wherever Alexander comes down is almost sure to be the majority position in the Senate,\\u201d Politico reports. \\u201cHe's a retiring defender of the Senate as an institution who's occasionally bucked his party, but he also counts Mitch McConnell as a longtime ally. He's more hesitant to criticize Trump than are some other Republicans, but he also has said it was \\u2018inappropriate\\u2019 for Trump to ask foreign governments to investigate his political opponents. \\u2026 [Democrats] are holding out hope that Alexander will be their hero in the mold of the late Sen. John McCain, whose extraordinary vote derailed the GOP\\u2019s effort to repeal Obamacare.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump is keeping his distance from the Republicans who might vote to call witnesses after White House advisers warned the president that outreach wouldn\\u2019t help his cause. Democrats are also giving them space. Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report: \\u201cDemocrats say there is no serious effort to privately lobby the Republicans, with the party relying instead on public opinion and the House prosecutors to squeeze them into breaking ranks.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) played with blue and purple fidget spinners. These are popular toys for children. In contrast, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who will potentially cast decisive votes on witnesses, almost never moved from their second-row desks. \\u201cCollins is a furious note taker, while Murkowski just stares intensely at the speaker,\\u201d Paul Kane reports.\\n\\n-- Collins sent a handwritten note to Roberts before his admonishment of the lawyers for both sides in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The senior senator for Maine, facing a tough reelection fight, told WCSH-TV in her state that the debate had become \\u201ctoo personal,\\u201d and she said she got mad when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Senate Republicans of being part of a coverup. \\u201cI had heard both sides impugn the integrity of one another and also cast aspersions on the Senate,\\u201d Collins said. \\u201cThat is just not appropriate.\\u201d Collins said she\\u2019s undecided on witnesses but added that the Nadler comments won\\u2019t affect her decision.\\n\\n-- Fresh polling shows most Americans overwhelmingly think witnesses should testify. An AP-NORC poll shows that 7 in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his top aides to appear before the Senate, including most Republicans. The same survey found that 45 percent think Trump should be convicted, 40 percent said he should not be and 14 percent said they don\\u2019t know enough to have an opinion.\\n\\n-- But, but, but: \\u201cMitch McConnell doesn\\u2019t care what you think,\\u201d Ben Terris writes in a new profile of the majority leader. \\u201cHe just wants to win.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A growing number of Republican senators are pointing to Trump's threat to invoke executive privilege as an excuse to vote against even trying to call witnesses, CNN reports: \\u201cGOP senators are privately and publicly raising concerns that issuing subpoenas -- to top officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton and for documents blocked by the White House -- will only serve to drag out the proceedings. Plus, many say there's little appetite for such a time-consuming fight, given that legal battles may ultimately not be successful and could force the courts to rule on hugely consequential constitutional issues about the separation of powers between the branches of government.\\u201d\\n\\nMORE FROM THE TRIAL:\\n\\n-- Democrats used a significant chunk of time on Thursday to preemptively defend the Bidens, who they expect Trump\\u2019s lawyers to attack when they get the floor: \\u201cRep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine,\\u201d Seung Min Kim, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. \\u201cBut Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump\\u2019s defense team. \\u2026 Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn\\u2019t focus on Biden\\u2019s actions toward Ukraine until 2019 \\u2026 She also referenced a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \\u2026 and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden\\u2019s desire to see [prosecutor Viktor] Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy \\u2026 As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cBefore the trial officially began Thursday afternoon, dozens of senators from both parties entered a secure facility in the Senate basement to view a classified document provided by Jennifer Williams, a national security adviser to Vice President Pence. \\u2026 The document had been previously submitted to the House Intelligence Committee. Some senators spent only a few minutes in the facility; others stayed for the better part of an hour. Several Democrats emerged to say they didn\\u2019t understand why the document had been classified. \\u2018I don\\u2019t believe it\\u2019s being withheld from the public for national security reasons. It may be withheld for political security reasons,\\u2019 said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).\\u201d\\n\\n-- The favorite talking point for most Senate Republicans continues to be that they\\u2019re learning nothing new because House managers are repeating themselves. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters during last night\\u2019s dinner break that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day in the Senate.\\u201d Ironically, he had repeated throughout the day that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day.\\u201d He said the same thing to CNN in the morning.\\n\\n\\u201cFor them to say they\\u2019re bored, it has a lot to do with them not wanting to hear evidence,\\u201d countered Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \\u201cThey don\\u2019t want to hear that this president who they\\u2019re so busy supporting did these things. As I put it, the truth hurts.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Tomorrow\\u2019s timing: Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) tells reporters that Saturday\\u2019s session will likely start and end earlier than the past few days. Party leaders are still trying to negotiate a deal to start the day as early as 8 a.m. so they can wrap up by noon. This would allow Democratic presidential candidates to fly to Iowa for campaign events. The trial has started at 1 p.m. during the week so that Chief Justice John Roberts can participate in pre-scheduled Supreme Court oral arguments before crossing the street to preside over the trial in the Capitol.\\n\\n-- Pelosi may be half a world away from the Senate floor, but that doesn\\u2019t mean the speaker doesn\\u2019t have the trial under control. From the Times: \\u201cEven in her absence from the Capitol this week, as the speaker traveled through Poland and Israel \\u2026 she had her hand firmly on the tiller. \\u2026 In many ways, Ms. Pelosi is the eighth, largely unseen manager of the Democrats\\u2019 case. \\u2026 Ms. Pelosi has dispatched her handpicked House general counsel to sit at the table inside the Senate chamber, with the prosecutors acting as her eyes and ears. She reviewed all the managers\\u2019 written briefs before they were filed.\\\"\\n\\n-- A core argument from Democrats yesterday was that the framers didn\\u2019t believe a president needed to break the law in order to warrant impeachment. \\u201cThe Constitution is not a suicide pact,\\u201d said Nadler, one of the managers. \\u201cIt does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The House\\u2019s lawyers filed a motion with an appeals court last night that says Trump\\u2019s defense lawyers have contradicted, and therefore undermined, the Department of Justice\\u2019s position on subpoenas. Ann Marimow reports: \\u201cThe lawyers for [Pelosi] asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to rule quickly on the pair of separation-of-powers cases, which they said could affect the Senate proceedings. House Democrats went to court seeking testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn and access to secret grand jury evidence from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\\u2019s Russia investigation. Justice Department attorneys have urged the appeals court to stay out of what they say are political disputes between Congress and the White House.\\u201d But the president\\u2019s team is now telling the Senate that these are matters more properly left to the courts.\\n\\n-- The White House also stonewalled the Government Accountability Office when the independent congressional watchdog requested information about the freeze on Ukraine aid. From Politico: \\u201cThe White House responded to the [GAO\\u2019s] inquiry with a one-page letter on Dec. 20, citing a legal memo from the Office of Management and Budget that defended the hold on military aid as necessary to ensure spending the funds wouldn't \\u2018conflict with the President's foreign policy.\\u2019 \\u2026 The correspondence is part of what led GAO to \\u2026 conclude last week that Trump's decision to withhold military aid violated federal law.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Follow the money: The documents turned over by Lev Parnas, Giuliani\\u2019s former associate, provide details about the web of dark money that helped fund Trump\\u2019s Ukrainian gambit. From Bloomberg News: \\u201cMoney flowed to Giuliani and his cohorts from home loans, friends, relative strangers and wealthy businessmen, some with interests in the gas and energy sector. It even came from a lawyer for an embattled Ukrainian energy tycoon fighting extradition to the U.S. on a conspiracy charge. \\u2026 The travel arrangements could brush up against campaign finance laws. While Giuliani [and Parnas] can volunteer as much of their time as they want for a campaign, any subsidy for such work by third parties would generally need to be reported as a contribution, and money from foreign individuals would be illegal.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dana Milbank: \\\"John Roberts comes face to face with the mess he made.\\\"\\n\\u2022 Ruth Marcus: \\u201cA more assertive John Roberts would be a bad idea.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Brenda Wineapple, author of a book on Andrew Johnson\\u2019s impeachment: \\u201cIf John Roberts is seeking a role model, let\\u2019s hope it\\u2019s not Salmon Chase.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Michael Gerson: \\u201cRepublicans aren\\u2019t serving the country, or even the president. Just themselves.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Eugene Robinson: \\u201cSenate Republicans\\u2019 defense of Trump is as mushy as apple pie.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Garret Graff, founding director of the Aspen Institute\\u2019s Cyber & Technology Program: \\u201cTrump won\\u2019t protect our elections, so private companies are doing it.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dan Drezner: \\u201cWhen American political institutions give up: After three years of Trump, there have been some unhealthy adjustments.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Regional radio hosts across the country have found themselves showered with attention by senior Trump officials, who have made accessibility to local conservative talking heads a central part of the president\\u2019s reelection strategy. Sarah Ellison reports: \\u201cPouring attention on regional talk-radio hosts is a classic Trumpworld move: giving relatively unknown characters proximity to the White House has paid off with a disproportionate amount of attention and praise lavished on the president and his agenda. \\u2026 The strategy has been particularly powerful as Trump and his team have engaged in what [Steve] Bannon calls \\u2018information warfare\\u2019 over the impeachment fight...\\u201d\\n\\n-- Kamala \\\"that-little-girl-was-me\\\" Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joe Biden to boost her standing in the veepstakes. From the New York Times: \\u201cSuch a move could lift Mr. Biden\\u2019s campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris\\u2019s chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California. An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial \\u2026 She and [Biden] have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Anita Hill told an Iowa crowd last night that it\\u2019s too late for Biden to apologize for the way he mistreated and diminished her when she testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991. \\u201cThe statute of limitations for his apology is up,\\u201d Hill said in response to a question from the audience at the University of Iowa, where she gave a lecture on ending sexual harassment. \\u201cWhat are you going to do about it? What are you going to do today? Will you promise as leader of this country \\u2026 to use all of your energy to address the problem as it happened and to prevent it from happening to another generation? That\\u2019s what I want to hear. And I not only want to hear from him, I want to hear from every one of them who want to be the leader of this country.\\u201d (BuzzFeed News)\\n\\n-- Bernie Sanders asked his supporters to cool it \\u2013 but they don\\u2019t always listen. Sean Sullivan reports: \\u201cCampaign officials have been pressing surrogates and other allies not to escalate combustible disputes that have recently become more personal, ... including a tense fight with Joe Biden, a separate altercation with [Elizabeth Warren] and a renewed schism with Hillary Clinton. \\u2026 But many Sanders supporters, and even some campaign aides, are inclined to take a more aggressive approach that they say will highlight important differences. \\u2026 Some close Sanders allies acknowledged the difficulty of balancing the passions of his loyal backers, inspired by his calls for a political revolution and his staunchly liberal platform, with the need to demonstrate a broader unity.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sanders\\u2019s rise in the polls means he\\u2019ll be talking more about his electability than a revolution. While speeches he\\u2019s made over the past two weeks still feature his signature call to action, he\\u2019s spending more time explaining to voters how policies like Medicare-for-all would work in their daily lives, as well as how he could beat Trump. (Bloomberg News)\\n\\n-- One in five women doubt that a woman can win the presidency, according to a new CNN poll. What\\u2019s telling about this news is that just 9 percent of men said the same. (Eugene Scott)\\n\\n-- Mike Bloomberg may be lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, but he\\u2019s attracted the president\\u2019s obsessive attention by baiting him with constant attack ads. Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer report: \\u201cThe president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him \\u2018Mini Mike\\u2019 to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials. \\u2018It\\u2019s very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,\\u2019 said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide \\u2026 Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. \\u2026 Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on \\u2018Fox & Friends\\u2019 on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as \\u2018dopes and babies.\\u2019 Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Former top supporters of Cory Booker accused Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s campaign of \\u201cchasing ambulances.\\u201d From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cThe phone calls to Amy Nielsen came around two hours apart. It was last Monday around 12 p.m., not long after the news broke, when her phone lit up with his name. By then, Nielsen considered Cory Booker \\u2018part of [her] family.\\u2019 \\u2026 So the end of his campaign felt \\u2026 like \\u2018a death.\\u2019 \\u2026 The next call came around 2:30 p.m., this time from an unknown number. It was Pete Buttigieg, calling to seek Nielsen\\u2019s support now that her candidate had made the decision to \\u2018step aside.\\u2019 \\u2026 \\u2018It was a gut punch \\u2014 like, really? He did not \\u2018step aside\\u2019 for you,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Like, wow, that\\u2019s some nerve right there.\\u2019 Later that night, she said, Nielsen heard from one of Booker\\u2019s field organizers who said she had already been contacted by the Buttigieg campaign to go door-knock.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Twelve years ago, Buttigieg spent the final week before the 2008 caucuses in rural southwest Iowa, trying to turn out voters for Barack Obama in one of the most conservative towns in the state. Holly Bailey spoke with him about what he learned: \\u201c\\u2018This was a new experience to really talk to people like this,\\u2019 Buttigieg recalled. \\u2018And what I found was, first of all, you can\\u2019t assume where somebody is going to be. We were in an area where a lot of people weren\\u2019t Democrats to begin with, and those who were were more likely to be for [John] Edwards. But they would hear us out when we were talking about Obama. And sometimes, as you do when you go door-to-door, somebody, because you represent a presidential campaign, would just pour out everything that was on their mind, everything they were upset about.\\\"\\n\\n\\u00ad-- Early voting means that millions are already eligible to cast their ballot. From the AP: \\u201cIn Minnesota, in-person early voting began Jan. 17. Vermont\\u2019s deadline to mail out its absentee ballots was the same day. Many of the 14 Super Tuesday states will offer some form of early voting between now and mid-February.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Howard County saw a bigger swing from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 than any other in Iowa. The Wall Street Journal's John McCormick took the pulse for 2020: \\u201cRecent interviews with dozens of voters here suggest that most of Mr. Trump\\u2019s 2016 supporters ... plan to stick with him, even though some said they have grown weary of his personal behavior and trade fights. Among those who previously voted for Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, many said they are reserving judgment until they see who wins the Democratic nomination. \\u2026 What such swing voters do in 2020 will have national implications. Before Mr. Trump, Howard County hadn\\u2019t backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. It is one of the 31 counties in Iowa\\u2014the most of any state\\u2014that backed Mr. Obama twice and then switched to Mr. Trump. The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A new Iowa caucus app is sparking election security concerns. From NBC News: \\u201cThe app will be used in Iowa and Nevada by caucus managers \\u2014 local registered Democrats who sign up to organize and run the caucus process in each location \\u2014 to expedite the process, calculate and assign delegates and report results back quickly. The app will also be used in satellite voting locations across the country and overseas. But questions about the app remain unanswered, including who developed it and whether it has been subjected to independent security testing. Security experts say that the app is a potential target for early election interference, particularly since it is downloaded on to the personal phones of the caucus managers. Party officials say operational security prevents them from disclosing specifics about the app.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Big-money groups aligned with the Senate GOP raised $68.3 million in 2019, an off-year record. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \\u201cThe majority of the money raised in 2019 came in the latter half of the year, particularly in the final two months, largely driven by the House Democrats\\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The ranks of scientists are growing thin in the Trump administration. Annie Gowen, Juliet Eilperin, Ben Guarino and Andrew Ba Tran report: \\u201cDozens of government computers sit in a nondescript building [in Kansas City, Mo.], able to connect to a data model that could help farmers manage the impact of a changing climate on their crops. But no one in this federal agency would know how to access the model, or, if they did, what to do with the data. That\\u2019s because the ambitious federal researcher who created it in Washington quit rather than move when the Agriculture Department relocated his agency to an office park here last fall. He is one of hundreds of scientists across the federal government who have been forced out, sidelined or muted since President Trump took office. \\u2026 In the first two years of the Trump administration, more than 1,600 federal scientists left government, according to Office of Personnel Management employment data \\u2026 That represents a 1.5 percent drop, compared with the 8 percent increase during the same period in the Obama administration.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Justice Department conceded that it had \\u201cinsufficient\\u201d cause to continue monitoring a former Trump campaign adviser during the Russia probe. Matt Zapotosky reports: \\u201cThe concession was revealed in an order posted on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\\u2019s website. In December, according to the order, the department told the court it had come to believe that in at least two of the four applications to monitor the former adviser, Carter Page, \\u2018there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause\\u2019 to believe he was acting as a Russian agent.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Trump administration will create additional new hurdles for pregnant foreign women seeking U.S. tourist visas. The administration said it's trying to crack down on what it calls \\u201cbirth tourism,\\\" trying to reduce what conservatives call \\\"anchor babies,\\\" by instructing consular officers to assess whether women requesting tourist visas are hoping to give birth on U.S. soil, which would effectively grant their children American citizenship. Starting today, the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor visas to women hoping to travel to the country with the stated purpose of having a child. Foggy Bottom said consular officers cannot require pregnancy tests to make the determination but wouldn\\u2019t rule out a woman\\u2019s physical appearance when making the decision, per Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti.\\n\\n-- Trump's \\\"national public health emergency\\\" declaration on the opioid crisis expired because his people at the Department of Health and Human Services forgot to renew it. An HHS spokesperson said the nine-day lapse had been corrected and blamed a clerical error. The emergency status, first announced in 2017 as a measure deemed necessary to direct more resources toward the drug overdose crisis, needs to be renewed every 90 days. (Politico)\\n\\n-- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, 17, needs to study economics before offering her thoughts on climate change. Heather Long reports from Davos: \\u201cThunberg and Mnuchin are both attending the World Economic Forum this week. \\u2026 At a news conference on Thursday, Mnuchin was asked for his reaction to Thunberg\\u2019s insistence on fossil fuel divestment. \\u2018Who is she?\\u2019 he tried to joke to reporters before taking a jab at Thunberg, suggesting she didn\\u2019t understand what she was talking about. \\u2026 \\u2018Is she the chief economist or who is she? I\\u2019m confused. ... After she goes and studies economics in college she can go back and explain that to us.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\n-- Actress Annabella Sciorra, who played Gloria in \\\"The Sopranos,\\\" testified that Harvey Weinstein raped her more than 25 years ago. Shayna Jacobs reports: \\u201c\\u2018I was punching him. I was kicking him. I was just trying to get him away from me, and he took my hands and put them over my head,\\u2019 Sciorra told the jury in Weinstein\\u2019s sexual assault trial, her eyes welling up with tears and her voice breaking. \\u2026 Weinstein, who had been watching her from the defense table, turned his gaze away from his accuser as she emotionally detailed the encounter. \\u2026 In her five hours of testimony, she described freezing after the attack, adding that \\u2018It was just so disgusting that my body started to shake.\\u2019 She said she had no romantic interest in Weinstein. The film producer arrived at her Manhattan apartment uninvited one night.\\u201d\\n\\n-- \\u201cA young, healthy man from Wuhan and a person living 1,500 miles from the epicenter of the coronavirus are among the latest victims of the outbreak, which has incited fear and anger across China as the important Spring Festival gets underway,\\u201d Anna Fifield reports from Beijing. \\u201cReports of eight new deaths from the pneumonia-like virus, taking the total to 26, came as authorities enforced a lockdown across large parts of the province of Hubei, population 59 million. But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies. Adding to the stress, Friday marked the official start of \\u2026 when China celebrates the arrival of the new lunar year. Authorities around the country, including in the capital Beijing, have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the holiday to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could be spread. \\u2026The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was already entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice. Production companies have postponed the release of seven blockbuster films that were to be released over the holiday, leading Chinese cinema companies to close the country\\u2019s 70,000 movie theaters. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cThe National Health Commission reported Friday that there are now more than 830 confirmed cases of infection, and reports of new cases continued to roll in from around the country: from Xinjiang in the west to Shandong in the east, from Inner Mongolia in the north to Hainan in the south. A total of 8,420 were reported to be under observation. South Korean authorities confirmed Friday that a second person tested positive for the new coronavirus. \\u2026 Japan also confirmed a second case, a man in his 40s from Wuhan who arrived in Japan on Sunday on a flight through Hong Kong. Other countries to have reported infections including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to a confirmed case in Washington state, Texas has reported a potential case of coronavirus in Brazos County, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The patient contracted a respiratory illness within two weeks of traveling in Wuhan and is being isolated at home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\\n\\n\\u201cSome details about the latest deaths in China have raised concerns about the virus\\u2019s spread. Until now, the vast majority of the people had been older than 60 and almost all of them had existing health conditions. All of them had been in Hubei province \\u2026 But the latest announcement said that 36-year-old man from Wuhan, identified only by his family name, Li, died on Thursday. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions, and had been treated with anti-virus medication and antibiotics since being admitted to a hospital on Jan. 9.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Wall Street stumbled yesterday amid fears that efforts to curtail the virus could further disrupt the global economy.

(Meagan Flynn)\\n\\n-- Trump\\u2019s sanctions on Iran are fueling a new refugee crisis \\u2013 in Turkey. Erin Cunningham and Mohammad Mahdi Sultani report: \\u201cDecades ago, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted thousands of people to flee to neighboring Iran. Now, many of these refugees are once again seeking a new home in a new land, Turkey, desperate to escape the dire economic conditions fueled by U.S. sanctions on Tehran. \\u2026 Turkish authorities are grappling with nearly 4 million refugees. This is the world\\u2019s largest population of displaced people, according to the United Nations, including more than 170,000 registered Afghan refugees. Turkey has struggled to contain the influx even as aid agencies say the number of arrivals from Iran is on the rise.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A critic of the Saudi Arabian government said a suspected Saudi agent tried to kidnap him on U.S. soil, a claim backed up by multiple U.S. and foreign sources familiar with the episode. From the Daily Beast: \\u201cAbdulrahman Almutairi is a 27-year-old comedian and former student at the University of San Diego with a big social-media presence. After Almutairi used social media to criticize the powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman over the October 2018 murder and dismemberment of Washington Post contributor [Jamal] Khashoggi, an unidentified Saudi man accompanied Almutairi\\u2019s father on a flight to collect Almutairi against his will and bring him back to Saudi Arabia...\\\"\\n\\n-- The Trump administration has missed the deadline, established by law, to turn over to Congress an unclassified report on Khashoggi's murder and the role played by the regime in Riyadh. From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cIn December, lawmakers passed a sweeping defense bill that included a provision ordering the director of national intelligence to send Congress an unclassified report identifying those responsible for Khashoggi\\u2019s death at a Saudi Arabian consulate in 2018. The legislation set the deadline for the report at 30 days, which passed earlier this week.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A small team of FBI agents spent years trying to solve a stubborn mystery \\u2013 whether officials from Saudi Arabia were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. A team of ProPublica and NYT Magazine reporters tell their story: \\u201cThe FBI has disputed the idea that foreign-policy considerations significantly influenced its investigation. In interviews, current and former bureau officials and federal prosecutors insisted to us that they never would have hesitated to pursue any Saudi who could have been solidly linked to the 9/11 plot \\u2026 But others who worked on the matter, including some at the FBI\\u2019s highest levels, say that the United States\\u2019 complex and often-troubled relationship with the Saudi regime was an unavoidable fact throughout their investigations. Even as the Saudi authorities became more cooperative with the United States in fighting al-Qaida after 2003, they were minimally and grudgingly helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry. According to current and former officials, requests for assistance that might rattle the Saudi security agencies were frequently balanced against FBI and CIA needs for Saudi help against continuing terror threats.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival, Benny Gantz, next week to discuss his Middle East peace plan.

Col. Alexander Vindman as the model of courage that Senate Republicans should follow during President Trump's trial.\\n\\nThe House Intelligence chairman fought back emotion late last night as he recalled Vindman\\u2019s November appearance before his committee. Vindman was born in the Soviet Union, but his father brought him here when he was a young boy. The director of European Affairs on the National Security Council, who received a Purple Heart after he was injured in Iraq, said that his father worried when he told him he would testify. But he reassured him. \\u201cThis is America,\\u201d Vindman recalled telling his dad. \\u201cHere, right matters.\\u201d The audience broke into spontaneous applause.\\n\\n\\u201cHere, right is supposed to matter,\\u201d Schiff told senators last night in the 10 p.m. hour, wrapping up day two of his case against Trump, which he will conclude Friday afternoon. \\u201cIt\\u2019s what\\u2019s made us the greatest nation on Earth. No Constitution can protect us if right doesn\\u2019t matter anymore. You know you can\\u2019t trust this president to do what\\u2019s right for this country. You can trust that he will do what\\u2019s right for Donald Trump. He\\u2019ll do it now. He\\u2019ll do it for the next several months. He\\u2019ll do it in the election if he\\u2019s allowed to. This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Democrat from California has repeatedly praised Vindman and others for \\u201csticking their necks out\\u201d to answer questions about the president\\u2019s alleged Ukraine coercion campaign when his former bosses, including ex-national security adviser John Bolton, refused to come before the House. \\u201cI have such admiration for the fact they did,\\u201d Schiff said on Wednesday. \\u201cBut what would really vindicate that leap of faith \\u2026 is if we show the same courage. They risked everything\\u2014their careers\\u2014and, yes, I know what you are asked to decide may risk yours too, but if they could show the courage, so can we.\\u201d\\n\\nOver the course of several hours earlier in the afternoon, Schiff had laid out 10 separate arguments for why Trump\\u2019s push to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden was intended for the president\\u2019s personal benefit and not to advance the national interest. \\u201cWhen we\\u2019re done, we believe that we will have made the case overwhelmingly that the president is guilty,\\u201d Schiff said. \\u201cIs there really any doubt about this? I mean, do we really have any doubt about the facts here? Does anybody really question whether the president is capable of what he\\u2019s charged with? No one is really making the argument Donald Trump would never do such a thing \\u2026 because, of course, we know that he would.\\u201d\\n\\nVindman remains assigned to the White House, something that has drawn the continuing ire of pro-Trump commentators. Schiff thanked senators last night for \\u201ckeeping an open mind about all of the issues we are presenting.\\u201d But, after Schiff spoke, Senate Republican leaders privately expressed growing confidence that they can win the vote next week to block additional witnesses from being summoned to testify. It\\u2019s not clear whether Schiff\\u2019s calls for courage have pushed any Republican senators toward breaking with the president and their party leaders on the key votes coming up next week surrounding summoning witnesses or subpoenaing documents.\\n\\n-- Schiff spoke a few hours after Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), one of the jurors, questioned Vindman\\u2019s patriotism by propagating an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory from the fever swamps of the dark corners of the pro-Trump fringe Internet. Blackburn claimed that Vindman once badmouthed the United States to Russians while serving overseas. \\u201cAdam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot,\\u201d she tweeted. \\u201cHow patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America\\u2019s greatest enemy?\\u201d\\n\\nVindman\\u2019s lawyer, former ambassador David Pressman, accused Blackburn of defaming his client. \\u201cThat a member of the Senate \\u2014 at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility \\u2014 would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice,\\u201d Pressman emailed. \\u201cWhile Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\\u201d\\n\\nBlackburn isn\\u2019t backing down and tweeted another attack around 8 p.m. Trump himself retweeted her this morning. The senator, who won Bob Corker's seat after he retired in 2018, has also accused Vindman of being a \\u201chandler\\u201d for the whistleblower who filed the complaint. Vindman testified before Schiff\\u2019s committee that he spoke with an intelligence community official about Trump\\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he declined to identify the official on the advice of counsel because he said he didn\\u2019t want to blow someone\\u2019s cover. But no public evidence exists that he was a source for the whistleblower.\\n\\n-- Schiff, a mild-mannered former federal prosecutor, has emerged as a surprisingly polarizing figure. Perhaps it\\u2019s because the president has accused him of committing treason, in addition to calling him \\u201cpencil neck\\u201d and \\u201cliddle.\\u201d Trump has now tweeted about Schiff hundreds of times. Schiff\\u2019s boosters say the right only loathes him because he\\u2019s so effective.\\n\\n-- The president\\u2019s allies at Fox News have elevated Schiff this week into perhaps the biggest boogeyman for their audience. Arguably he\\u2019s a bigger target of their vitriol right now than Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders or even the four minority women in the Squad. If you\\u2019ve watched the network for even a few minutes this week, especially in primetime, you\\u2019ve probably seen hosts and guests attacking the man from Burbank.\\n\\nTucker Carlson continued his mockery last night of the man he\\u2019s taken to calling \\u201cSaint Adam,\\u201d a nickname intended to convey what he portrays as the congressman\\u2019s sanctimoniousness. \\u201cSay what you will, but as a piece of theater, it had literally everything,\\u201d Carlson said after playing a video clip of Schiff talking on the Senate floor about how Trump\\u2019s approach to Ukraine has played into Russian President Vladimir Putin\\u2019s hands.\\n\\n\\u201cThey accused us of doing nefarious things with this Lev Parnas character,\\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told Sean Hannity. \\u201cThe truth is Adam Schiff and the Democrats have been doing nefarious things with Parnas!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAdam's ordinarily not that stupid, but when you tell the jury, the Senate, on one day that they're corrupt, and then you tell the American people they cannot be trusted to pick the commander in chief, that's just a wildly stupid trial strategy,\\u201d former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told Bret Baier.\\n\\n-- Rudy Giuliani appeared on \\u201cFox & Friends\\u201d this morning to attack the Democratic managers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a complete show on the part of the Democrats, and they should be sued for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and they should pay for that hearing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to present over the next two to three weeks shocking crimes at the highest levels of both governments while the Senate is listening to a totally phony group of stories about non-impeachable offenses.\\u201d\\n\\nGiuliani has been promising for a while now to release said evidence. It has not been forthcoming, so take such claims with more than a grain of salt. The president\\u2019s lawyer also said for months that he was going to release a lengthy report rebutting former special counsel Bob Mueller\\u2019s findings on Russian interference and whether Trump obstructed justice. He never did.\\n\\n-- Meanwhile, thought leaders on the left have effusively praised Schiff's performance. Esquire\\u2019s Charlie Pierce calls Schiff the Daniel Webster of our time. Walter Dellinger, who was acting U.S. solicitor general under Bill Clinton, said Schiff offered \\u201cone of the most impressive performances by a lawyer I have ever seen.\\u201d MSNBC legal commentator Jason Johnson called Schiff\\u2019s opening statement on Wednesday \\u201ca speech that kids will be giving in 2060 at university projects.\\u201d Actress and activist Alyssa Milano, who has been attending the trial, said \\u201cit felt like you were watching a one-man show on Broadway.\\u201d\\n\\nStephen Colbert offered an early valentine to Schiff during his show. \\u201cIt was gratifying to see someone taking the constitutional responsibility of their office seriously,\\u201d the comedian told his viewers on CBS. Breaking out of character, he said that Schiff spoke \\u201cclearly, passionately, cogently, and, I believe, courageously.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Schiff \\u201cwell spoken\\u201d and said \\u201cdid a good job of creating a tapestry.\\u201d But other Republican senators have told reporters that Schiff was overly \\u201csmooth\\u201d or \\u201cslick,\\u201d which they meant as negatives. \\u201cIn a way I do feel like I\\u2019m introducing myself to a number of the senators,\\u201d Schiff told the Associated Press, adding that they\\u2019re \\u201cfinding I\\u2019m not the demon that I\\u2019m portrayed as on Fox.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope that four Republicans still might be persuaded to vote for witnesses. \\u201cJust about every Republican\\u2019s eyes were glued on Mr. Schiff,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a powerful rendition.\\u201d\\n\\n-- All eyes are on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). \\u201cPrivately, senior Senate Republicans expect the vote to seek witness testimony to fail, but they are watching Alexander and several other Republicans closely. And wherever Alexander comes down is almost sure to be the majority position in the Senate,\\u201d Politico reports. \\u201cHe's a retiring defender of the Senate as an institution who's occasionally bucked his party, but he also counts Mitch McConnell as a longtime ally. He's more hesitant to criticize Trump than are some other Republicans, but he also has said it was \\u2018inappropriate\\u2019 for Trump to ask foreign governments to investigate his political opponents. \\u2026 [Democrats] are holding out hope that Alexander will be their hero in the mold of the late Sen. John McCain, whose extraordinary vote derailed the GOP\\u2019s effort to repeal Obamacare.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump is keeping his distance from the Republicans who might vote to call witnesses after White House advisers warned the president that outreach wouldn\\u2019t help his cause. Democrats are also giving them space. Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report: \\u201cDemocrats say there is no serious effort to privately lobby the Republicans, with the party relying instead on public opinion and the House prosecutors to squeeze them into breaking ranks.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) played with blue and purple fidget spinners. These are popular toys for children. In contrast, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who will potentially cast decisive votes on witnesses, almost never moved from their second-row desks. \\u201cCollins is a furious note taker, while Murkowski just stares intensely at the speaker,\\u201d Paul Kane reports.\\n\\n-- Collins sent a handwritten note to Roberts before his admonishment of the lawyers for both sides in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The senior senator for Maine, facing a tough reelection fight, told WCSH-TV in her state that the debate had become \\u201ctoo personal,\\u201d and she said she got mad when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Senate Republicans of being part of a coverup. \\u201cI had heard both sides impugn the integrity of one another and also cast aspersions on the Senate,\\u201d Collins said. \\u201cThat is just not appropriate.\\u201d Collins said she\\u2019s undecided on witnesses but added that the Nadler comments won\\u2019t affect her decision.\\n\\n-- Fresh polling shows most Americans overwhelmingly think witnesses should testify. An AP-NORC poll shows that 7 in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his top aides to appear before the Senate, including most Republicans. The same survey found that 45 percent think Trump should be convicted, 40 percent said he should not be and 14 percent said they don\\u2019t know enough to have an opinion.\\n\\n-- But, but, but: \\u201cMitch McConnell doesn\\u2019t care what you think,\\u201d Ben Terris writes in a new profile of the majority leader. \\u201cHe just wants to win.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A growing number of Republican senators are pointing to Trump's threat to invoke executive privilege as an excuse to vote against even trying to call witnesses, CNN reports: \\u201cGOP senators are privately and publicly raising concerns that issuing subpoenas -- to top officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton and for documents blocked by the White House -- will only serve to drag out the proceedings. Plus, many say there's little appetite for such a time-consuming fight, given that legal battles may ultimately not be successful and could force the courts to rule on hugely consequential constitutional issues about the separation of powers between the branches of government.\\u201d\\n\\nMORE FROM THE TRIAL:\\n\\n-- Democrats used a significant chunk of time on Thursday to preemptively defend the Bidens, who they expect Trump\\u2019s lawyers to attack when they get the floor: \\u201cRep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine,\\u201d Seung Min Kim, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. \\u201cBut Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump\\u2019s defense team. \\u2026 Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn\\u2019t focus on Biden\\u2019s actions toward Ukraine until 2019 \\u2026 She also referenced a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \\u2026 and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden\\u2019s desire to see [prosecutor Viktor] Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy \\u2026 As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cBefore the trial officially began Thursday afternoon, dozens of senators from both parties entered a secure facility in the Senate basement to view a classified document provided by Jennifer Williams, a national security adviser to Vice President Pence. \\u2026 The document had been previously submitted to the House Intelligence Committee. Some senators spent only a few minutes in the facility; others stayed for the better part of an hour. Several Democrats emerged to say they didn\\u2019t understand why the document had been classified. \\u2018I don\\u2019t believe it\\u2019s being withheld from the public for national security reasons. It may be withheld for political security reasons,\\u2019 said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).\\u201d\\n\\n-- The favorite talking point for most Senate Republicans continues to be that they\\u2019re learning nothing new because House managers are repeating themselves. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters during last night\\u2019s dinner break that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day in the Senate.\\u201d Ironically, he had repeated throughout the day that it felt like \\u201cGroundhog Day.\\u201d He said the same thing to CNN in the morning.\\n\\n\\u201cFor them to say they\\u2019re bored, it has a lot to do with them not wanting to hear evidence,\\u201d countered Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \\u201cThey don\\u2019t want to hear that this president who they\\u2019re so busy supporting did these things. As I put it, the truth hurts.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Tomorrow\\u2019s timing: Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) tells reporters that Saturday\\u2019s session will likely start and end earlier than the past few days. Party leaders are still trying to negotiate a deal to start the day as early as 8 a.m. so they can wrap up by noon. This would allow Democratic presidential candidates to fly to Iowa for campaign events. The trial has started at 1 p.m. during the week so that Chief Justice John Roberts can participate in pre-scheduled Supreme Court oral arguments before crossing the street to preside over the trial in the Capitol.\\n\\n-- Pelosi may be half a world away from the Senate floor, but that doesn\\u2019t mean the speaker doesn\\u2019t have the trial under control. From the Times: \\u201cEven in her absence from the Capitol this week, as the speaker traveled through Poland and Israel \\u2026 she had her hand firmly on the tiller. \\u2026 In many ways, Ms. Pelosi is the eighth, largely unseen manager of the Democrats\\u2019 case. \\u2026 Ms. Pelosi has dispatched her handpicked House general counsel to sit at the table inside the Senate chamber, with the prosecutors acting as her eyes and ears. She reviewed all the managers\\u2019 written briefs before they were filed.\\\"\\n\\n-- A core argument from Democrats yesterday was that the framers didn\\u2019t believe a president needed to break the law in order to warrant impeachment. \\u201cThe Constitution is not a suicide pact,\\u201d said Nadler, one of the managers. \\u201cIt does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The House\\u2019s lawyers filed a motion with an appeals court last night that says Trump\\u2019s defense lawyers have contradicted, and therefore undermined, the Department of Justice\\u2019s position on subpoenas. Ann Marimow reports: \\u201cThe lawyers for [Pelosi] asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to rule quickly on the pair of separation-of-powers cases, which they said could affect the Senate proceedings. House Democrats went to court seeking testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn and access to secret grand jury evidence from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\\u2019s Russia investigation. Justice Department attorneys have urged the appeals court to stay out of what they say are political disputes between Congress and the White House.\\u201d But the president\\u2019s team is now telling the Senate that these are matters more properly left to the courts.\\n\\n-- The White House also stonewalled the Government Accountability Office when the independent congressional watchdog requested information about the freeze on Ukraine aid. From Politico: \\u201cThe White House responded to the [GAO\\u2019s] inquiry with a one-page letter on Dec. 20, citing a legal memo from the Office of Management and Budget that defended the hold on military aid as necessary to ensure spending the funds wouldn't \\u2018conflict with the President's foreign policy.\\u2019 \\u2026 The correspondence is part of what led GAO to \\u2026 conclude last week that Trump's decision to withhold military aid violated federal law.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Follow the money: The documents turned over by Lev Parnas, Giuliani\\u2019s former associate, provide details about the web of dark money that helped fund Trump\\u2019s Ukrainian gambit. From Bloomberg News: \\u201cMoney flowed to Giuliani and his cohorts from home loans, friends, relative strangers and wealthy businessmen, some with interests in the gas and energy sector. It even came from a lawyer for an embattled Ukrainian energy tycoon fighting extradition to the U.S. on a conspiracy charge. \\u2026 The travel arrangements could brush up against campaign finance laws. While Giuliani [and Parnas] can volunteer as much of their time as they want for a campaign, any subsidy for such work by third parties would generally need to be reported as a contribution, and money from foreign individuals would be illegal.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Dana Milbank: \\\"John Roberts comes face to face with the mess he made.\\\"\\n\\u2022 Ruth Marcus: \\u201cA more assertive John Roberts would be a bad idea.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Brenda Wineapple, author of a book on Andrew Johnson\\u2019s impeachment: \\u201cIf John Roberts is seeking a role model, let\\u2019s hope it\\u2019s not Salmon Chase.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Michael Gerson: \\u201cRepublicans aren\\u2019t serving the country, or even the president.

Sarah Ellison reports: \\u201cPouring attention on regional talk-radio hosts is a classic Trumpworld move: giving relatively unknown characters proximity to the White House has paid off with a disproportionate amount of attention and praise lavished on the president and his agenda. \\u2026 The strategy has been particularly powerful as Trump and his team have engaged in what [Steve] Bannon calls \\u2018information warfare\\u2019 over the impeachment fight...\\u201d\\n\\n-- Kamala \\\"that-little-girl-was-me\\\" Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joe Biden to boost her standing in the veepstakes. From the New York Times: \\u201cSuch a move could lift Mr. Biden\\u2019s campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris\\u2019s chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California. An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial \\u2026 She and [Biden] have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Anita Hill told an Iowa crowd last night that it\\u2019s too late for Biden to apologize for the way he mistreated and diminished her when she testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991. \\u201cThe statute of limitations for his apology is up,\\u201d Hill said in response to a question from the audience at the University of Iowa, where she gave a lecture on ending sexual harassment. \\u201cWhat are you going to do about it?

Sean Sullivan reports: \\u201cCampaign officials have been pressing surrogates and other allies not to escalate combustible disputes that have recently become more personal, ... including a tense fight with Joe Biden, a separate altercation with [Elizabeth Warren] and a renewed schism with Hillary Clinton. \\u2026 But many Sanders supporters, and even some campaign aides, are inclined to take a more aggressive approach that they say will highlight important differences. \\u2026 Some close Sanders allies acknowledged the difficulty of balancing the passions of his loyal backers, inspired by his calls for a political revolution and his staunchly liberal platform, with the need to demonstrate a broader unity.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Sanders\\u2019s rise in the polls means he\\u2019ll be talking more about his electability than a revolution. While speeches he\\u2019s made over the past two weeks still feature his signature call to action, he\\u2019s spending more time explaining to voters how policies like Medicare-for-all would work in their daily lives, as well as how he could beat Trump. (Bloomberg News)\\n\\n-- One in five women doubt that a woman can win the presidency, according to a new CNN poll. What\\u2019s telling about this news is that just 9 percent of men said the same. (Eugene Scott)\\n\\n-- Mike Bloomberg may be lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, but he\\u2019s attracted the president\\u2019s obsessive attention by baiting him with constant attack ads. Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer report: \\u201cThe president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him \\u2018Mini Mike\\u2019 to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials. \\u2018It\\u2019s very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,\\u2019 said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide \\u2026 Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. \\u2026 Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on \\u2018Fox & Friends\\u2019 on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as \\u2018dopes and babies.\\u2019 Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Former top supporters of Cory Booker accused Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s campaign of \\u201cchasing ambulances.\\u201d From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cThe phone calls to Amy Nielsen came around two hours apart. It was last Monday around 12 p.m., not long after the news broke, when her phone lit up with his name. By then, Nielsen considered Cory Booker \\u2018part of [her] family.\\u2019 \\u2026 So the end of his campaign felt \\u2026 like \\u2018a death.\\u2019 \\u2026 The next call came around 2:30 p.m., this time from an unknown number. It was Pete Buttigieg, calling to seek Nielsen\\u2019s support now that her candidate had made the decision to \\u2018step aside.\\u2019 \\u2026 \\u2018It was a gut punch \\u2014 like, really? He did not \\u2018step aside\\u2019 for you,\\u2019 she said. \\u2018Like, wow, that\\u2019s some nerve right there.\\u2019 Later that night, she said, Nielsen heard from one of Booker\\u2019s field organizers who said she had already been contacted by the Buttigieg campaign to go door-knock.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Twelve years ago, Buttigieg spent the final week before the 2008 caucuses in rural southwest Iowa, trying to turn out voters for Barack Obama in one of the most conservative towns in the state. Holly Bailey spoke with him about what he learned: \\u201c\\u2018This was a new experience to really talk to people like this,\\u2019 Buttigieg recalled. \\u2018And what I found was, first of all, you can\\u2019t assume where somebody is going to be. We were in an area where a lot of people weren\\u2019t Democrats to begin with, and those who were were more likely to be for [John] Edwards. But they would hear us out when we were talking about Obama. And sometimes, as you do when you go door-to-door, somebody, because you represent a presidential campaign, would just pour out everything that was on their mind, everything they were upset about.\\\"\\n\\n\\u00ad-- Early voting means that millions are already eligible to cast their ballot. From the AP: \\u201cIn Minnesota, in-person early voting began Jan. 17. Vermont\\u2019s deadline to mail out its absentee ballots was the same day. Many of the 14 Super Tuesday states will offer some form of early voting between now and mid-February.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Howard County saw a bigger swing from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 than any other in Iowa. The Wall Street Journal's John McCormick took the pulse for 2020: \\u201cRecent interviews with dozens of voters here suggest that most of Mr. Trump\\u2019s 2016 supporters ... plan to stick with him, even though some said they have grown weary of his personal behavior and trade fights. Among those who previously voted for Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, many said they are reserving judgment until they see who wins the Democratic nomination. \\u2026 What such swing voters do in 2020 will have national implications. Before Mr. Trump, Howard County hadn\\u2019t backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. It is one of the 31 counties in Iowa\\u2014the most of any state\\u2014that backed Mr. Obama twice and then switched to Mr. Trump. The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A new Iowa caucus app is sparking election security concerns. From NBC News: \\u201cThe app will be used in Iowa and Nevada by caucus managers \\u2014 local registered Democrats who sign up to organize and run the caucus process in each location \\u2014 to expedite the process, calculate and assign delegates and report results back quickly. The app will also be used in satellite voting locations across the country and overseas. But questions about the app remain unanswered, including who developed it and whether it has been subjected to independent security testing. Security experts say that the app is a potential target for early election interference, particularly since it is downloaded on to the personal phones of the caucus managers. Party officials say operational security prevents them from disclosing specifics about the app.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Big-money groups aligned with the Senate GOP raised $68.3 million in 2019, an off-year record. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: \\u201cThe majority of the money raised in 2019 came in the latter half of the year, particularly in the final two months, largely driven by the House Democrats\\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The ranks of scientists are growing thin in the Trump administration. Annie Gowen, Juliet Eilperin, Ben Guarino and Andrew Ba Tran report: \\u201cDozens of government computers sit in a nondescript building [in Kansas City, Mo.], able to connect to a data model that could help farmers manage the impact of a changing climate on their crops. But no one in this federal agency would know how to access the model, or, if they did, what to do with the data. That\\u2019s because the ambitious federal researcher who created it in Washington quit rather than move when the Agriculture Department relocated his agency to an office park here last fall. He is one of hundreds of scientists across the federal government who have been forced out, sidelined or muted since President Trump took office. \\u2026 In the first two years of the Trump administration, more than 1,600 federal scientists left government, according to Office of Personnel Management employment data \\u2026 That represents a 1.5 percent drop, compared with the 8 percent increase during the same period in the Obama administration.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Justice Department conceded that it had \\u201cinsufficient\\u201d cause to continue monitoring a former Trump campaign adviser during the Russia probe. Matt Zapotosky reports: \\u201cThe concession was revealed in an order posted on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\\u2019s website. In December, according to the order, the department told the court it had come to believe that in at least two of the four applications to monitor the former adviser, Carter Page, \\u2018there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause\\u2019 to believe he was acting as a Russian agent.\\u201d\\n\\n-- The Trump administration will create additional new hurdles for pregnant foreign women seeking U.S. tourist visas. The administration said it's trying to crack down on what it calls \\u201cbirth tourism,\\\" trying to reduce what conservatives call \\\"anchor babies,\\\" by instructing consular officers to assess whether women requesting tourist visas are hoping to give birth on U.S. soil, which would effectively grant their children American citizenship. Starting today, the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor visas to women hoping to travel to the country with the stated purpose of having a child. Foggy Bottom said consular officers cannot require pregnancy tests to make the determination but wouldn\\u2019t rule out a woman\\u2019s physical appearance when making the decision, per Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti.\\n\\n-- Trump's \\\"national public health emergency\\\" declaration on the opioid crisis expired because his people at the Department of Health and Human Services forgot to renew it. An HHS spokesperson said the nine-day lapse had been corrected and blamed a clerical error. The emergency status, first announced in 2017 as a measure deemed necessary to direct more resources toward the drug overdose crisis, needs to be renewed every 90 days.

Shayna Jacobs reports: \\u201c\\u2018I was punching him. I was kicking him. I was just trying to get him away from me, and he took my hands and put them over my head,\\u2019 Sciorra told the jury in Weinstein\\u2019s sexual assault trial, her eyes welling up with tears and her voice breaking. \\u2026 Weinstein, who had been watching her from the defense table, turned his gaze away from his accuser as she emotionally detailed the encounter. \\u2026 In her five hours of testimony, she described freezing after the attack, adding that \\u2018It was just so disgusting that my body started to shake.\\u2019 She said she had no romantic interest in Weinstein. The film producer arrived at her Manhattan apartment uninvited one night.\\u201d\\n\\n-- \\u201cA young, healthy man from Wuhan and a person living 1,500 miles from the epicenter of the coronavirus are among the latest victims of the outbreak, which has incited fear and anger across China as the important Spring Festival gets underway,\\u201d Anna Fifield reports from Beijing. \\u201cReports of eight new deaths from the pneumonia-like virus, taking the total to 26, came as authorities enforced a lockdown across large parts of the province of Hubei, population 59 million. But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies. Adding to the stress, Friday marked the official start of \\u2026 when China celebrates the arrival of the new lunar year. Authorities around the country, including in the capital Beijing, have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the holiday to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could be spread. \\u2026The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was already entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice. Production companies have postponed the release of seven blockbuster films that were to be released over the holiday, leading Chinese cinema companies to close the country\\u2019s 70,000 movie theaters. \\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cThe National Health Commission reported Friday that there are now more than 830 confirmed cases of infection, and reports of new cases continued to roll in from around the country: from Xinjiang in the west to Shandong in the east, from Inner Mongolia in the north to Hainan in the south. A total of 8,420 were reported to be under observation. South Korean authorities confirmed Friday that a second person tested positive for the new coronavirus. \\u2026 Japan also confirmed a second case, a man in his 40s from Wuhan who arrived in Japan on Sunday on a flight through Hong Kong. Other countries to have reported infections including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to a confirmed case in Washington state, Texas has reported a potential case of coronavirus in Brazos County, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The patient contracted a respiratory illness within two weeks of traveling in Wuhan and is being isolated at home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\\n\\n\\u201cSome details about the latest deaths in China have raised concerns about the virus\\u2019s spread. Until now, the vast majority of the people had been older than 60 and almost all of them had existing health conditions. All of them had been in Hubei province \\u2026 But the latest announcement said that 36-year-old man from Wuhan, identified only by his family name, Li, died on Thursday. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions, and had been treated with anti-virus medication and antibiotics since being admitted to a hospital on Jan. 9.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Wall Street stumbled yesterday amid fears that efforts to curtail the virus could further disrupt the global economy.

A State Department spokesman said extraditing Sacoolas would \\u201cset an extraordinarily troubling precedent\\u201d but did not elaborate. (Meagan Flynn)\\n\\n-- Trump\\u2019s sanctions on Iran are fueling a new refugee crisis \\u2013 in Turkey. Erin Cunningham and Mohammad Mahdi Sultani report: \\u201cDecades ago, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted thousands of people to flee to neighboring Iran. Now, many of these refugees are once again seeking a new home in a new land, Turkey, desperate to escape the dire economic conditions fueled by U.S. sanctions on Tehran. \\u2026 Turkish authorities are grappling with nearly 4 million refugees. This is the world\\u2019s largest population of displaced people, according to the United Nations, including more than 170,000 registered Afghan refugees. Turkey has struggled to contain the influx even as aid agencies say the number of arrivals from Iran is on the rise.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A critic of the Saudi Arabian government said a suspected Saudi agent tried to kidnap him on U.S. soil, a claim backed up by multiple U.S. and foreign sources familiar with the episode. From the Daily Beast: \\u201cAbdulrahman Almutairi is a 27-year-old comedian and former student at the University of San Diego with a big social-media presence. After Almutairi used social media to criticize the powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman over the October 2018 murder and dismemberment of Washington Post contributor [Jamal] Khashoggi, an unidentified Saudi man accompanied Almutairi\\u2019s father on a flight to collect Almutairi against his will and bring him back to Saudi Arabia...\\\"\\n\\n-- The Trump administration has missed the deadline, established by law, to turn over to Congress an unclassified report on Khashoggi's murder and the role played by the regime in Riyadh. From BuzzFeed News: \\u201cIn December, lawmakers passed a sweeping defense bill that included a provision ordering the director of national intelligence to send Congress an unclassified report identifying those responsible for Khashoggi\\u2019s death at a Saudi Arabian consulate in 2018. The legislation set the deadline for the report at 30 days, which passed earlier this week.\\u201d\\n\\n-- A small team of FBI agents spent years trying to solve a stubborn mystery \\u2013 whether officials from Saudi Arabia were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. A team of ProPublica and NYT Magazine reporters tell their story: \\u201cThe FBI has disputed the idea that foreign-policy considerations significantly influenced its investigation. In interviews, current and former bureau officials and federal prosecutors insisted to us that they never would have hesitated to pursue any Saudi who could have been solidly linked to the 9/11 plot \\u2026 But others who worked on the matter, including some at the FBI\\u2019s highest levels, say that the United States\\u2019 complex and often-troubled relationship with the Saudi regime was an unavoidable fact throughout their investigations. Even as the Saudi authorities became more cooperative with the United States in fighting al-Qaida after 2003, they were minimally and grudgingly helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry. According to current and former officials, requests for assistance that might rattle the Saudi security agencies were frequently balanced against FBI and CIA needs for Saudi help against continuing terror threats.\\u201d\\n\\n-- Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival, Benny Gantz, next week to discuss his Middle East peace plan. The meeting comes amid Trump\\u2019s trial, as well as Netanyahu and Gantz\\u2019s own troubles at home, where they\\u2019ve both failed to form a government.

in 2005 journalist laurence rees described the inner workings of the nazi death camp in his book auschwitz a new history and elie wiesel spoke in 1988 about his experience at auschwitz","{\"id\": \"npr--2020-01-24--'Fresh Air' Marks The 75th Anniversary Of The Liberation Of Auschwitz\", \"date\": \"2020-01-24\", \"source\": \"npr\", \"title\": \"'Fresh Air' Marks The 75th Anniversary Of The Liberation Of Auschwitz\", \"content\": \"'Fresh Air' Marks The 75th Anniversary Of The Liberation Of Auschwitz\\n\\nIn 2005, journalist Laurence Rees described the inner workings of the Nazi death camp in his book, Auschwitz: A New History, and Elie Wiesel spoke in 1988 about his experience at Auschwitz.\\n\\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Monday, January 27, is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Today we're going to listen to two interviews. In a bit, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016. But first, we'll listen to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, the site of history's largest mass murder, as well as insights into Hitler's campaign of genocide against the Jews of Europe.\\n\\nRees' book is based on more than a hundred interviews with Auschwitz survivors and Nazi perpetrators, many of whom spoke on the record for the first time. He believes his search for the truth was aided by the fact that surviving Nazis had reached an age where candor no longer jeopardized careers and by the fall of communism, which opened up a wealth of new archival material. His book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nLAURENCE REES: Thank you very much.\\n\\nDAVIES: You note early in this book that you were one of relatively few people who've been able to interview quite a number of war criminals from three of the great totalitarian powers of the 20th century - that is, Stalinist Russia, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. And you say in this book that having done so, you can confirm that Nazi war criminals that you met were different from the other two.\\n\\nDAVIES: How were they different?\\n\\nREES: They're different in a kind of paradoxical way because when I grew up at school and first heard about the Nazis and - the whole line that was taken then in the '70s was that Nazi war criminals would give us the standard defense. Oh, I was only - I was acting under orders. I was acting under orders. And so that was kind of what you imagine, when you meet people like this, they're going to say. Well, paradoxically, that was the kind of response I got from Stalin's secret policemen, from members of the Imperial Army who committed terrible crimes in China and in the Pacific War. That was what they were saying. I didn't tend to get that from Nazi war criminals. The frightening thing to me - particularly frightening - was that most of the Nazi war criminals I've met actually, when you push them, say, well - and you say, well, why were you doing this - don't say, I was acting on your orders. Say, well, at the time, I thought what I was doing was right.\\n\\nDAVIES: And what do you attribute that to? I mean, they seemed to be true believers in the cause.\\n\\nREES: I think it's a variety of things that, in the end, for me, mean that Nazism is more horrible but more interesting as a phenomenon. I think it's to do with the fact that, certainly, if you were a secret policeman in Stalin's Russia, I think for the most part, the terror was so ubiquitous that no one was safe from the knock at the door. No one could really understand exactly why individuals were sometimes being targeted. Stalin famously had one of his own Politburo, Molotov's wife, tortured. I've talked to people who were at meetings where they stood up and were denouncing other people as enemies of the state because they were worried they'd be denounced. There didn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to some of this. So this means that the only way of making sense of it, really, for a lot of these people doing the bad things was to say, well, you know, I was doing it because I'm ordered to do it.\\n\\nSimilarly, in Imperial Japan, the level of training - the brutality of the training of Japanese soldiers, I think, is without parallel in the modern world, what these people were put through in training - bullying, the vicious beatings and so on, the indoctrination as well. But it was such that if you didn't - you know, you obeyed, and you obeyed blindly, I think, in a number of cases.\\n\\nWhat's going on in Germany is rather different. What's going on in Germany is that - I think to some extent thanks to the work of Goebbels, who - again, a horrible, nasty person, but the genius of propaganda of the 20th century. Thanks to the work of Goebbels, but also thanks to the fact that there was a genuine feeling of injustice in Germany after the end of the First World War. There was a feeling put about that Jews were to blame. There was a feeling of fear of communism, that Jews were somehow falsely attributed in their totality to communism. Simultaneously, Jews were thought to be running Roosevelt in American politics, anti-German and so on. So there were a whole series of what they took to be, at the time, pragmatic, positive reasons to do what they were doing, and that's one of the frightening things about it.\\n\\nDAVIES: When the Nazis spoke of achieving the Final Solution to the Jewish problem in the early years of the war, is it clear they meant extermination of the Jews?\\n\\nREES: No, they didn't mean extermination, I don't believe. It's clear that the words Final Solution change in meaning, I believe, during 1941. When Heydrich is charged by Goring with organizing the Final Solution to the Jewish problem, initially, the order explicitly states evacuation. And that was the overt policy, certainly, since 1938 and the Anschluss with Austria. When the German troops go into Austria, they, under Eichmann of the SS of - you know, later absolutely infamous for being one of the organizers of the murders in the Final Solution - he organizes a system of expropriation, of robbing, of treating violently the Jews of Vienna, robbing them and then those who can almost pay to go, expelling them.\\n\\nI think that what's clear is that Hitler always hated the Jews. He always loathed the Jews. He always wanted rid of the Jews in one way or another. The form that that wanting rid of would take varied at different points. The Final Solution, therefore, varied, I think, at different points. And certainly, at the beginning of the war, the Final Solution, I think, to the Jewish problem is one as they see it. I mean, horrible to use this language. It's not a problem. It's the problem of their mentality. But as they described it, the Jewish problem - the way to, quote, \\\"solve,\\\" unquote, this was by evacuation.\\n\\nDAVIES: It's remarkable that you find places where people talk about the notion of mass killings as being uncivilized and un-German.\\n\\nREES: Yes, that's right. Both Heydrich and Himmler say that in the - 1940. And so we know, I think, beyond reasonable doubt that the Final Solution does not mean extermination because in - actually on paper, Himmler and Heydrich are talking about extermination as being uncivilized when later on openly, at his speech at Poznan in 1943, Himmler is talking about physical extermination. Something changes.\\n\\nAnd again, we know that from the documents that - and from eyewitness testimony that in the summer of 1940, they had this - what it seems now at this distance - utterly outlandish, insane plan to transport Jews to Madagascar, the island of Madagascar of Africa. What they anticipated, the Nazis, was that the war was going to end in 1940. Britain would make peace, and they had - would have the French colonies at their disposal, including Madagascar. And the Jews would be able in French ships probably to be shipped there, which is why they were herded into ghettos. Ghettos were only ever seen as a temporary measure prior to expulsion.\\n\\nBut again, as you see time and again in this terrible history, things don't go the way the Nazis want. They're constantly - really, they're always constantly thinking the war's going to end. They keep thinking, any minute now, any moment now, the war's going to stop. We'll have won, and we'll be able to deal with this in this way. And it never does end when they think it's going to end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, the development of this notion of a Final Solution from being the evacuation of Jews to the extermination of Jews you sort of describe as a process of increasing radicalization. Now...\\n\\nDAVIES: What does this mean?\\n\\nREES: So I think one of the best examples of this cumulative radicalization, of the Nazis responding brutally to crises that they themselves have created, occurs in the Lodz ghetto, where what happens is that the Jews have been imprisoned. They've been forced to give up their money to buy food. They've run out of money, so they begin to starve. So then Nazi functionaries face a choice. Some say, let them all starve. Others say, no, no. We need to get something from these people, exploit them. That view prevails. They put them to work in horrible conditions, of course, and they pay them a tiny pittance. But those who are working can actually feed themselves a bit. Other people - the old people, children - are suffering terribly and still starving.\\n\\nAnd actually, one Nazi functionary looks at this situation they themselves have created and can - and writes a note saying, wouldn't it be more humane to kill these people rather than let them starve? So that's an example of how they end up in this position that they themselves have created, where they almost - where someone has the obscenity to write that it's more humane to kill somebody than to leave them to starve.\\n\\nDAVIES: So it's done with this utterly immoral idea of herding people into ghettos with the idea you will transport them out. When you can't transport them out...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...They begin to starve. And one thing leads to another, and then you've come to this utterly horrific conclusion that...\\n\\nREES: Yes. And so what...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...You have to kill people - hundreds of thousands.\\n\\nREES: And also you see - exactly. And what's going on in the minds of a lot of these Nazis - unbelievably, we might think today, rightly - is a sense of annoyance and indignation as - that the Jews have brought this on themselves because the war is still going on, and they can't be expelled.\\n\\nSo I've heard Nazis say - and seen it - that they say, oh, well, of course Churchill is controlled by the Jews. That's why they'd - the British don't do the logical, sensible thing in 1940 and make peace with us.\\n\\nwe're still trapped in this war, and we're in the war as a result of what the Jews are doing. And if the war had gone - if the war had ended, we'd been able to expel the Jews somewhere - where incidentally they would probably have had some form of genocidal horror awaiting them anyway - but they would have been expelled somewhere, and now we can't expel them. What are we supposed to do with them?\\n\\nAnd so this is the kind of mentality that you hear and you see it absolutely plainly now, I think, as a result of a lot of new research around Pearl Harbor, that there are killings going on before Pearl Harbor, notably in Eastern Europe and behind the lines in the war against the Soviet Union. But there's nothing - there is no major death camping operation. But what happens is, as soon as Pearl Harbor happens, you see Hitler's rhetoric change. And he starts talking about, right now it's a world war, and you remember my prophecy of 1939, in which he stated if the Jews succeed in causing a world war, the result will be their annihilation.\\n\\nHe sees this as a fulfillment of a prophecy. He said, if the Jews get involved and cause a world war - America coming into the war is de facto a world war. They simultaneously think the Jews are not just behind Stalin and - but they're behind Roosevelt as well. It's pathological, this stuff. They absolutely believed that I think. And so as a result of that, they absolutely push forward with a massive expansion in the killing around that time, immediately after Pearl Harbor.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to the interview I recorded in 2005 with journalist Laurence Rees, when his book \\\"Auschwitz: A New History\\\" was published.\\n\\nWhen the Nazis first began executing Jews in large numbers, they did it, really, with firing squads. What was the impact of that kind of close-quarter execution on the Germans who carried it out?\\n\\nREES: The impact for quite a substantial proportion of them was terrible. They were emotionally made distraught by this. They're having to shoot women and children at very close range. And this - thus, I believe, begins this journey to the gas chambers that we know of, the infamous gas chambers. And it's because, we see, when Himmler visits Minsk in August 1941, he's told of the emotional problems that the killing in this way, the shooting killings are doing to his men. And he puts in training, as a result, a whole series of experiments to devise a way of killing that is not so emotionally disturbing to his men.\\n\\nI'd always thought that the reason that the gas chambers were devised was primarily to kill people in large numbers. Well, it wasn't just that at all; it was actually so that there was a less emotionally stressful way that the killers could commit murder.\\n\\nDAVIES: They began initially by putting people into a - I guess, in a cabin of some kind and piping exhaust fumes into it.\\n\\nREES: That's right. Well, what happens now again - and we can see this as an example of both cumulative radicalism and competition within the Nazi state - is various people at various different locations come up with different initiatives. What happens is there's an initiative which is the gas van, which is a van where you connect the exhaust back into a compartment hermetically sealed in the rear, where people are gassed. There's the building of the - camp Belzec, which is the first stationary gas chambers, again, using large engines with carbon gases going in to gas them.\\n\\nAnd then at the same time, in September 1941, you find a totally different initiative beginning at Auschwitz, which is the only camp where this initiative begins, which is the use of Zyklon B. Zyklon B is a powerful insecticide using - used for disinfecting rooms. And it was already in Auschwitz, and they used it for delousing prisoners' clothes and rooms because they had a terrible problem with lice because of the inhumane conditions, not least, that prisoners were kept in.\\n\\nAnd one of the functionaries there thinks to himself, well, it's got printed on the Zyklon B cans - dangerous to life; don't go in the room while this is being let off. And he goes, well, actually, of course, if you want to kill people, they should be in the room. So he starts experimenting, not on Jews but on the sick and on Soviet prisoners of war at Auschwitz. And he starts with Zyklon B. The experiments go wrong to start with. They alter doses. They do experiments. And eventually, they evolve a different method of killing to the ones used in the death camps of Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec.\\n\\nDAVIES: Now, as you noted, Auschwitz was not originally conceived of as a death camp, but as a labor camp, which meant that it was large and had lots and lots of barracks. And you note that when the killings of Jews really accelerated in 1942 that this was done not so much at Auschwitz, but at three other camps - at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. And...\\n\\nDAVIES: They were specifically set up as death camps. And you made the point that when visitors go to those sites, they are always shocked at how small they are even though...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...These three camps alone accounted for 1.7 million deaths. Why were these deaths camps so small? How did they function?\\n\\nREES: Because they had no other function than killing. Auschwitz is unique in the history of the Nazi states, unique in the history of the world. It's not just the site of the largest mass murder the world's ever seen as a physical site. It's also unique in the Nazi state in that it's the only camp that combines two functions. It's both a concentration camp and a death camp, and those functions vary at different times in its history.\\n\\nWhat's happening at places like Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor is they are set up in 1942 - all of them open in 1942. They are set up purely to murder Jews. And if you plan on just - just, I say, just - murdering people, one of the shocking things is you need no real space at all. These places are a few hundred yards square - nothing left of them now because the Nazis themselves destroyed these camps in late 1943. They knew that they wanted to keep this their secret. And they were essentially places where trains would arrive, and the Jews would be taken off. And 99 - more than 99% of these people would be dead, probably, within two hours. So there was no stay of any kind, really, at all.\\n\\nA camp like Treblinka, which was capable of killing 300,000 people in little more - in around less than two months in the summer of 1942 - 300,000 people in that one small space - it was run by around 20 Germans and about 100 Ukrainian guards. And these Ukrainians had been mostly selected from prison camps. They had been people fighting on the Russian side who, in the horror of the prison camps that the Germans set up for these Russians where millions died, were offered this chance of saving themselves, to go and work on the German side.\\n\\nAnd then there was the third category of people working in these camps who were, tragically, Jews themselves. The Nazis selected, very occasionally, from incoming transports a number of fit Jewish people and forced them, on pain of their own immediate murder, to participate in the process by cutting people's hair, by showing the way to the gas chamber, by cleaning the gas chambers, by burning the bodies and so on. And the torment that these people went through is scarcely imaginable.\\n\\nDAVIES: So the actual horrific task of murder, of cleaning the bodies, of cleaning out the chambers after the killing has occurred is, by and large, not done by Germans.\\n\\nREES: Never done by Germans, really. No.\\n\\nDAVIES: Yeah. And that was true at Auschwitz as well.\\n\\nREES: So they end up at the huge, industrial-style killing factories of Auschwitz-Birkenau. You have a crematorium gas chamber complex that's capable, in the summer of 1941, of killing 10,000 people in one day - 10,000 people in one day. And it's run by between 2 to 4 Germans and around about 100 Jews. Now, the Nazis save the absolute moment of murder to themselves. They're the ones who drop the canisters of Zyklon B actually into the gas chamber. But pretty much all the other tasks involved in making this operate are run by Jewish Sonderkommando, who we know both from interviewing some - the few people who survived this and also from documents that Jewish Sonderkommando wrote and hid in the foundations of the building often at the time. The torment these people went through was practically indescribable.\\n\\nDAVIES: I was struck by your description of the arrival buildings at the death camps, that they often were fairly pleasant-looking, I mean, with flower plantings and the kind - I guess designed to reinsure the incoming inmates...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...That their fate was not what it was going to be.\\n\\nREES: Again, this is all part of the cynicism, but it's also part of the learning curve that the Nazis go on because what happens at Treblinka, which was the most deadly, if you like, of all of these death camps outside of Auschwitz - they were killing so many people that the system broke down - summer of 1942 - that the system broke down. There were bodies everywhere. There was just mayhem, people being shot. It was chaos.\\n\\nSo they actually had to shut it down and reorganize it. And the new commander of Treblinka, what he managed to do as he pushed it forward was come up with all of these devices like the fake railway station, fake timetables, lovely flowers - same thing happened at Sobibor. One of the most extraordinary individuals I've ever met, Toivi Blatt, who survived Sobibor, said, actually, when he got off there, he'd been expecting some horrible place. He said, it was always beautiful. And as you say, it's all designed so that when, say, Jews coming from Holland arrive, they're told, you are at a transit station, hygiene stop while - we just need to take a shower, have your hair cut and we're going to move on east. And it's deliberately designed to do that.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more from him after a break, and we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. Monday, January 27 is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, based on more than 100 interviews with survivors and Nazi perpetrators. It's called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nDAVIES: You note that Auschwitz became, really, a death camp at a point when the Nazi death machine had become very well-developed, and Nazi initiative and ingenuity had addressed some of the technical difficulties of mass murder and had worked out solutions. Tell us a bit about those arriving Jews who were selected for immediate death. What exactly faced them, and who did the work?\\n\\nREES: Well, they would be taken from the - by the time - in 1944, by the time this became the most sophisticated procedure, they'd be taken straight from the arrival ramp, which was the area they arrived at, directly inside Birkenau. The railway line ran into the camp. They'd be taken, really, a few hundred yards round to one of four combination gas chamber-crematoriums.\\n\\nThey would then be taken down in two - cases of two of them, they'd be taken on - all on ground level. The other two - one had basement, undressing rooms and gas chambers. They'd be taken down or into a room where they'd be told to undress because they were going to have to have a shower as part of the camp's admittance procedure. And they would then be crammed into an airtight room - the door shut, locked behind them.\\n\\nAnd then either from above, in the case of the basement gas chambers or through the windows of the ones all on the ground floor, canisters of Zyklon B would be thrown in. And it would normally - it would take - dependent on how many people were in these gas chambers, dependent on the weather because Zyklon B was more effective the warmer the air was - it would take 15, 20 minutes for these people to die, I think, a horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible death of suffocation and poisoning.\\n\\nThe gas chambers would then be opened. The Sonderkommando, Jewish - other Jewish prisoners with gas masks, would have to go in, would take out the bodies, would - in the case of the adults - go through them and take out the gold teeth, would shave the hair of the women. The bodies would then be pushed into lifts taken up to the first - to the ground level or the basement gas chambers, where the bodies would be burned. And then their ashes would be collected and either thrown in the immediate area or taken down to the nearby river, Vistula. So that was the horror of the process that they devised in the end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Were many of the SS officials who conducted the murder at Auschwitz held accountable for their actions?\\n\\nREES: Well, I think this is one of the great scandals of this story, a story rich in scandal at every level. But this is one of the greater scandals, which is that less than - well, maybe, 12%, 10% of SS people who worked at Auschwitz were ever prosecuted. Around 90% of the SS who worked at Auschwitz during the war escaped all forms of prosecution. And myself, I think that's a scandal.\\n\\nDAVIES: Why was that?\\n\\nREES: One of the reasons that so few people were prosecuted was that by the 1960s, the German prosecutors had taken the view that unless a member of the SS was absolutely directly involved in the killing or had been directly involved in acts of brutality - physical brutality - then they could get off scot-free. And of course, it meant that the way that the gas chambers had been devised, which was that so few Germans were needed for their actual physical operation, it meant that the vast majority of SS at the camp could say, oh, I wasn't really directly involved in the killing at all.\\n\\nNow, myself, I think that's a calamity. That's terrible because, of course, if you're working in the currency units counting out money, if you're working in the SS transport division, if you're a guard at the camp, you are directly involved in the operation of the camp that results - that's an extermination center. So I certainly disagree with - you know, for all the good it's going to do anybody that I disagree, but I certainly disagree that they took that view.\\n\\nDAVIES: In this book, you compare the crimes of the Holocaust to other mass exterminations in history - going as far back as Genghis Khan's genocide in Persia - and conclude that this represents the lowest act in human history and should not be allowed to recede into distant memory as some of these other mass killings have. What's different about this extermination?\\n\\nREES: I think that if you're looking at how you should think about events in the past - or even events in the present, actually - what you've got to do is look at the overall circumstances in which these things happen. You know, it's not much good thinking, well, oh, the Vikings were terrible. Well, the Vikings operated in a system of values at the time that was - they were, by all accounts from latest research on Vikings, for example, scarcely better or worse than any other 10th century marauding hordes. I mean, it's a ludicrous - it seems to me a ludicrous way to go to start blaming Vikings for being Vikings.\\n\\nSomething different is going on here. What's happening is that you are taking a cultured nation at the heart of Europe in the 20th century, long after the Enlightenment, that has adopted absolute civilized cultural values in the wake of the end of the first world war. It is a thriving, although troubled, democracy. Its take - it's got rid of all legislation against Jews. It's liberal in that regard. All of these things are going on. It's got a great written culture. It's got a great musical culture. It's got a great artistic culture. It's the place you would think would be the most civilized almost to be. And yet that very place, within a matter of years, turns into this.\\n\\nSo you've got a journey that they go on that's unlike - and it's not like the journey the Vikings go on or Genghis Khan or the plains goes on. This is not like that. This is a different journey. This is a journey from one pole - one extreme, if you like, to the other extreme. And in the process, they use 20th-century technology that they warp and adapt to this very service of mass killing. And unlike Stalin, who even at his worst, when he was deporting entire nations - the Kalmyk nations, the Crimean Tatars and so on. He's deporting whole nations to Siberia. Even Stalin isn't trying to put forward measures to eliminate them in their entirety. So something different, I think, is going on here.\\n\\nDAVIES: So many students of Nazism and the Holocaust have tried to in some way answer the question, how could this happen? You've interviewed a hundred or so survivors and war criminals from Auschwitz. Do you feel you have some new insights into that question?\\n\\nREES: I think what surprised me about this - because I never intended this career (laughter). Like, this kind of happened to me, you know, that I've been - written so much on this and made so many programs on this. And one of the reasons it's happened is because I keep thinking I'm getting close to being able to answer that properly. And as I - as I keep getting towards it, it keeps going away from me a bit more. So I think I'm a long way down the road, I hope, to being able to get to there. But I'm not there yet. Maybe it's absolutely impossible to get there.\\n\\nBut one thing I took from this was a big fear I've now got about people of absolute faith. I always thought faith of itself was - could only be a positive thing. Everyone talks about the importance of having faith. Well, these guys had faith, absolute faith. And there's one really desperately upsetting - all desperately upsetting. But ideologically, there's one desperately particularly upsetting moment where - in the book where I talk about how Himmler and Hoss most admired, as prisoners, Jehovah's Witnesses. They pointed to them and said, see that faith? That's the kind of faith we need in our fuhrer - absolute, unshakable faith.\\n\\nNow, of course, no one is equating what the Nazis did with Jehovah's Witnesses, who operate a whole creed of peace and love and so on. Absolutely. But the very notion of absolute faith is at the core of this. And so I'm beginning to start to have questions about people who - or communities that are absolutely certain about things.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, Laurence Rees, thanks so much for speaking with us.\\n\\nREES: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" After a break, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: Today we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Next, we'll hear Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016 at the age of 87. Wiesel was born in what was then Romania and was 15 when he and his family were sent from Hungary to Auschwitz in 1944. He was later moved to another camp, Buchenwald, from which he was liberated in 1945. Among his family, only two of his sisters survived the war.\\n\\nWiesel became one of the first survivors to devote his life to bearing witness to the Holocaust. His memoir, \\\"Night,\\\" was published in English in 1960, and he spent the rest of his life speaking about social injustice. Terry spoke with him in 1988 when his novel \\\"Twilight\\\" was published.\\n\\nTERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Why have you made it your life work to bear witness?\\n\\nELIE WIESEL: What else could one do, having gone through certain events? I believe a human being, if he or she wants to remain human, then he or she must do something with what we have seen, endured, witnessed. Not to live through an experience, but the experience is there - it's bad, but not to communicate it is worse.\\n\\nGROSS: You know, I think that it's almost a human instinct to let time dim memories of horror and tragedy. Have you fought that in a way? Have you tried to keep those memories alive so that you can continue to communicate about them?\\n\\nWIESEL: Naturally. I mean, naturally, the human being wants to forget pain. In this case, although, for most of those who went through the experience during the war, they want to remember more and more and more. They go deep into their own consciousness, into their own memory, trying to find more events, more faces, more eyes, more words, more sighs, more tears, more agonies. It's never enough because we feel that we have to tell the story, and no one can tell the story fully.\\n\\nGROSS: You once described Auschwitz as the defeat of the intellect that wants to find a meaning, with a capital M, in history. Do you feel that, nevertheless, you've been really spending your life trying to find some meaning of the Holocaust, some larger meaning you could tell us about man or about God?\\n\\nWIESEL: I'll tell you, all the questions I had remain open. I really don't believe that I found any answer to any one of the questions I had. I don't know the meaning. I don't know why it happened. I don't know how it happened. I still don't know anything, really. I'm trying to tell a story, and even the story cannot be told. And therefore, it cannot be communicated, and therefore, people - and deep down, I know - won't receive the testimony that we are giving. We are a very special kind of writers, those who write about that event. And I write very little about it, really. But I know that people cannot understand.\\n\\nGROSS: I think when you were in the camps, you saw some religious people stop praying and saw people who had not been observant turn to God. You had been very observant and very immersed in the religious texts when you were young, before you were deported to the concentration camps. How did your experiences and your survival in the camps change your own experience of religion?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, the change - to the extent that it occurred - did not occur there. It's afterwards that the problems became urgent. Inside that universe, we continued praying. We continued believing. We continued affirming. We needed that link with our past. It's only after the war that I began asking questions, and I began articulating a certain protest. And that protest is still with me. I am still angry at all the forces in history that provoked such a catastrophe. That doesn't mean that my faith left me or that I left fate. I try to develop a certain protest within fate.\\n\\nGROSS: Have you gone back to the religious texts that you were reading when you were young?\\n\\nWIESEL: I never stopped reading or studying. Even inside that universe, I studied. I had a teacher there with name I never knew and whose face I hardly saw. But he was a teacher, the head of a Talmudic school in Galicia. And we work together, and we studied together. I know. It's incredible.\\n\\nGROSS: This is in the camps.\\n\\nWIESEL: Inside - in Auschwitz. So we studied. They kept on studying from morning to evening. And after the war, the first thing I wanted was a book, was a Talmudic treatise. I never stopped studying. That probably saved me.\\n\\nGROSS: In your first novel, \\\"Night...\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: \\\"Night\\\" was not a novel. It was a memoir.\\n\\nGROSS: I don't know why I think of it as a novel.\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Every word...\\n\\nGROSS: I think of think of it as a very autobiographical novel, but...\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah. Well, I - then I guess I was going to ask you about your religious teacher who narrowly escaped from being murdered with hundreds or thousands of other Jews in the forest by the SS. And he somehow managed to escape and come back to your village to warn people about what was happening, and no one would listen.\\n\\nWIESEL: We didn't listen because he was a simple man. He was a beetle. Had he been an important person, I think some people would have listened. What is so extraordinary is when we remember today the silence, the indifference of so many people who were not inside the tragedy but on the other side, just imagine if we had heard on the radio Ben-Gurion from Israel or Roosevelt or Churchill telling Hungarian Jews don't go because they are killing. They're massacring. I think they would have believed them. But why should one believe a beetle, a man who came back from the other side and was telling such atrocious stories?\\n\\nGROSS: We're getting back to the question of madness. I think a lot of people in your village just assumed he'd lost his mind and was making up - you know, was having visions or something, that this couldn't possibly have happened.\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, absolutely. I myself - I was very close to him. And we spent many, many hours alone together every evening. And I would listen to him. Plus, I love to listen to stories, even to his stories, maybe especially to hear stories. But I didn't believe them.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel recorded in 1988. Wiesel died in 2016.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you do anything to mentally prepare for what was in store when your father told you that the next day the whole village was going to be deported, the whole ghetto was going to be deported?\\n\\nWIESEL: No. We didn't know. See; Hungarian Jewry was deported at such a pace. Everything came so fast. The Hungarians allowed the Germans to come in in March. The end of May, all the Jews were out already in Germany. In less than six weeks, Eichmann had managed to deport to their death more than 600,000 Jews - men, women and children. So it came very fast. And it ended very fast. We didn't have time to think.\\n\\nGROSS: You've described yourself as having been very weak and sickly when you were young. I know you think of yourself as having survived purely by chance. Did you learn things, though, to help you survive when you were in the camps?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Not at all. I was the wrong person, the wrong candidate for survival. I was always weak, as you said, and disarmed, cowardly. I would never try to do anything, which was not what I could have done or should have done. I never asked for a supplement of anything. I didn't volunteer. I was always pleased to think that I could be invisible. Not to make myself visible was my task. I don't know why I survived. I don't know how I survived. It was really by accident.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you know when you got out of the camps that you wanted to write?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, I knew that I was going to write before I entered the camps. I come from a tradition, from the Jewish tradition, we believe - which believes in words, in language, in communication. And already at the age of 12 or 13, I was writing. Of course, it wasn't good. It meant nothing, but I tried to write. I even found the manuscript. I went back to my hometown. It's not good. But I tried.\\n\\nAfterwards, I knew I would have to bear witness. Everyone who was there is a witness, and everyone who was there is a true witness. Others who are trying to speak about this subject occasionally are false witnesses. And I felt that I had to be a true witness. And therefore, I decided to wait for 10 years, not to speak about it but to use language related to these experiences until I knew that the words were true words.\\n\\nGROSS: Why 10 years? Why not five years? Why not one year? No, seriously. What made you think..\\n\\nGROSS: ...That 10 years is what you needed to really know what it was you wanted to say and what words you wanted to say it with?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, 10 is a biblical figure, I know. And the - it's a good figure, why not? I cannot tell you that I got up one morning and decided that - let's see, that five or six or seven. It entered my mind - it has to be 10. I decided 10.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you actually have an anniversary where like...\\n\\nGROSS: And that day you sat down to write.\\n\\nGROSS: And is that when you started to write \\\"Night?\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" yes. That's when I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" on April 11, 1955, which is 10 years later.\\n\\nGROSS: And looking back, do you think that this was definitely the right thing to do, to wait those 10 years? In what ways were you changed as a witness and as a writer during those 10 years?\\n\\nWIESEL: Maybe I didn't change, but the words in me changed. They grew. you know, Words have strange destiny, too. They grow, they get old, they die, they come back. Words can be turned into spears. They can be turned into prayers. It's a strange world that you are in when you deal with words.\\n\\nGROSS: In one of your essays, you wrote that after the war, you deliberately avoided all contact with Germans and that their presence sickened you physically. Did that change? And if so, what changed that?\\n\\nWIESEL: It did. But I didn't want to go back to Germany, really. I went once because I didn't want to judge people. I went once in the early '60s to do a piece for commentary. And I realized that every person I see in the street, I judge him or her asking, where was he, what did he do, how old is he, could I - could he have been there? And I didn't want that role, so I didn't go back. But I did go back last year in '86, '87.\\n\\nToday, you have a young generation of Germans. And I do not believe in collective guilt. So I have absolutely no problem with the young Germans. I even feel sorry for the young Germans because to be maybe sons or daughters of killers is different than to be sons and daughters of the victims. And I felt sorry for them. I still do.\\n\\nGROSS: The generations of survivors are getting older. The older generation of survivors is no longer with us. Are you concerned about what's going to happen after the generations of survivors pass on, like, who will be around to actually speak the memories?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, I'm profoundly concerned, naturally. In one of my novels, I try to describe that feeling of the last survivor, what it means to be the very last. And I would not want to be that last survivor. But on the other hand, we are leaving a legacy. We are bequeathing a certain message, a certain story. This tragedy is the most documented tragedy in recorded history. And therefore later on, if there will be a later on, anyone wishing to know will know where to go for knowledge.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988.

I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Monday, January 27, is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Today we're going to listen to two interviews. In a bit, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016. But first, we'll listen to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, the site of history's largest mass murder, as well as insights into Hitler's campaign of genocide against the Jews of Europe.\\n\\nRees' book is based on more than a hundred interviews with Auschwitz survivors and Nazi perpetrators, many of whom spoke on the record for the first time. He believes his search for the truth was aided by the fact that surviving Nazis had reached an age where candor no longer jeopardized careers and by the fall of communism, which opened up a wealth of new archival material. His book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nLAURENCE REES: Thank you very much.\\n\\nDAVIES: You note early in this book that you were one of relatively few people who've been able to interview quite a number of war criminals from three of the great totalitarian powers of the 20th century - that is, Stalinist Russia, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. And you say in this book that having done so, you can confirm that Nazi war criminals that you met were different from the other two.\\n\\nDAVIES: How were they different?\\n\\nREES: They're different in a kind of paradoxical way because when I grew up at school and first heard about the Nazis and - the whole line that was taken then in the '70s was that Nazi war criminals would give us the standard defense. Oh, I was only - I was acting under orders. I was acting under orders. And so that was kind of what you imagine, when you meet people like this, they're going to say. Well, paradoxically, that was the kind of response I got from Stalin's secret policemen, from members of the Imperial Army who committed terrible crimes in China and in the Pacific War. That was what they were saying. I didn't tend to get that from Nazi war criminals. The frightening thing to me - particularly frightening - was that most of the Nazi war criminals I've met actually, when you push them, say, well - and you say, well, why were you doing this - don't say, I was acting on your orders. Say, well, at the time, I thought what I was doing was right.\\n\\nDAVIES: And what do you attribute that to? I mean, they seemed to be true believers in the cause.\\n\\nREES: I think it's a variety of things that, in the end, for me, mean that Nazism is more horrible but more interesting as a phenomenon. I think it's to do with the fact that, certainly, if you were a secret policeman in Stalin's Russia, I think for the most part, the terror was so ubiquitous that no one was safe from the knock at the door. No one could really understand exactly why individuals were sometimes being targeted. Stalin famously had one of his own Politburo, Molotov's wife, tortured. I've talked to people who were at meetings where they stood up and were denouncing other people as enemies of the state because they were worried they'd be denounced. There didn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to some of this. So this means that the only way of making sense of it, really, for a lot of these people doing the bad things was to say, well, you know, I was doing it because I'm ordered to do it.\\n\\nSimilarly, in Imperial Japan, the level of training - the brutality of the training of Japanese soldiers, I think, is without parallel in the modern world, what these people were put through in training - bullying, the vicious beatings and so on, the indoctrination as well. But it was such that if you didn't - you know, you obeyed, and you obeyed blindly, I think, in a number of cases.\\n\\nWhat's going on in Germany is rather different. What's going on in Germany is that - I think to some extent thanks to the work of Goebbels, who - again, a horrible, nasty person, but the genius of propaganda of the 20th century. Thanks to the work of Goebbels, but also thanks to the fact that there was a genuine feeling of injustice in Germany after the end of the First World War. There was a feeling put about that Jews were to blame. There was a feeling of fear of communism, that Jews were somehow falsely attributed in their totality to communism. Simultaneously, Jews were thought to be running Roosevelt in American politics, anti-German and so on. So there were a whole series of what they took to be, at the time, pragmatic, positive reasons to do what they were doing, and that's one of the frightening things about it.\\n\\nDAVIES: When the Nazis spoke of achieving the Final Solution to the Jewish problem in the early years of the war, is it clear they meant extermination of the Jews?\\n\\nREES: No, they didn't mean extermination, I don't believe. It's clear that the words Final Solution change in meaning, I believe, during 1941. When Heydrich is charged by Goring with organizing the Final Solution to the Jewish problem, initially, the order explicitly states evacuation. And that was the overt policy, certainly, since 1938 and the Anschluss with Austria. When the German troops go into Austria, they, under Eichmann of the SS of - you know, later absolutely infamous for being one of the organizers of the murders in the Final Solution - he organizes a system of expropriation, of robbing, of treating violently the Jews of Vienna, robbing them and then those who can almost pay to go, expelling them.\\n\\nI think that what's clear is that Hitler always hated the Jews. He always loathed the Jews. He always wanted rid of the Jews in one way or another. The form that that wanting rid of would take varied at different points. The Final Solution, therefore, varied, I think, at different points. And certainly, at the beginning of the war, the Final Solution, I think, to the Jewish problem is one as they see it. I mean, horrible to use this language. It's not a problem. It's the problem of their mentality. But as they described it, the Jewish problem - the way to, quote, \\\"solve,\\\" unquote, this was by evacuation.\\n\\nDAVIES: It's remarkable that you find places where people talk about the notion of mass killings as being uncivilized and un-German.\\n\\nREES: Yes, that's right. Both Heydrich and Himmler say that in the - 1940. And so we know, I think, beyond reasonable doubt that the Final Solution does not mean extermination because in - actually on paper, Himmler and Heydrich are talking about extermination as being uncivilized when later on openly, at his speech at Poznan in 1943, Himmler is talking about physical extermination. Something changes.\\n\\nAnd again, we know that from the documents that - and from eyewitness testimony that in the summer of 1940, they had this - what it seems now at this distance - utterly outlandish, insane plan to transport Jews to Madagascar, the island of Madagascar of Africa. What they anticipated, the Nazis, was that the war was going to end in 1940. Britain would make peace, and they had - would have the French colonies at their disposal, including Madagascar. And the Jews would be able in French ships probably to be shipped there, which is why they were herded into ghettos. Ghettos were only ever seen as a temporary measure prior to expulsion.\\n\\nBut again, as you see time and again in this terrible history, things don't go the way the Nazis want. They're constantly - really, they're always constantly thinking the war's going to end. They keep thinking, any minute now, any moment now, the war's going to stop. We'll have won, and we'll be able to deal with this in this way. And it never does end when they think it's going to end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, the development of this notion of a Final Solution from being the evacuation of Jews to the extermination of Jews you sort of describe as a process of increasing radicalization. Now...\\n\\nDAVIES: What does this mean?\\n\\nREES: So I think one of the best examples of this cumulative radicalization, of the Nazis responding brutally to crises that they themselves have created, occurs in the Lodz ghetto, where what happens is that the Jews have been imprisoned. They've been forced to give up their money to buy food. They've run out of money, so they begin to starve. So then Nazi functionaries face a choice. Some say, let them all starve. Others say, no, no. We need to get something from these people, exploit them. That view prevails. They put them to work in horrible conditions, of course, and they pay them a tiny pittance. But those who are working can actually feed themselves a bit. Other people - the old people, children - are suffering terribly and still starving.\\n\\nAnd actually, one Nazi functionary looks at this situation they themselves have created and can - and writes a note saying, wouldn't it be more humane to kill these people rather than let them starve? So that's an example of how they end up in this position that they themselves have created, where they almost - where someone has the obscenity to write that it's more humane to kill somebody than to leave them to starve.\\n\\nDAVIES: So it's done with this utterly immoral idea of herding people into ghettos with the idea you will transport them out. When you can't transport them out...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...They begin to starve. And one thing leads to another, and then you've come to this utterly horrific conclusion that...\\n\\nREES: Yes. And so what...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...You have to kill people - hundreds of thousands.\\n\\nREES: And also you see - exactly. And what's going on in the minds of a lot of these Nazis - unbelievably, we might think today, rightly - is a sense of annoyance and indignation as - that the Jews have brought this on themselves because the war is still going on, and they can't be expelled.\\n\\nSo I've heard Nazis say - and seen it - that they say, oh, well, of course Churchill is controlled by the Jews. That's why they'd - the British don't do the logical, sensible thing in 1940 and make peace with us.\\n\\nwe're still trapped in this war, and we're in the war as a result of what the Jews are doing. And if the war had gone - if the war had ended, we'd been able to expel the Jews somewhere - where incidentally they would probably have had some form of genocidal horror awaiting them anyway - but they would have been expelled somewhere, and now we can't expel them. What are we supposed to do with them?\\n\\nAnd so this is the kind of mentality that you hear and you see it absolutely plainly now, I think, as a result of a lot of new research around Pearl Harbor, that there are killings going on before Pearl Harbor, notably in Eastern Europe and behind the lines in the war against the Soviet Union. But there's nothing - there is no major death camping operation. But what happens is, as soon as Pearl Harbor happens, you see Hitler's rhetoric change. And he starts talking about, right now it's a world war, and you remember my prophecy of 1939, in which he stated if the Jews succeed in causing a world war, the result will be their annihilation.\\n\\nHe sees this as a fulfillment of a prophecy. He said, if the Jews get involved and cause a world war - America coming into the war is de facto a world war. They simultaneously think the Jews are not just behind Stalin and - but they're behind Roosevelt as well. It's pathological, this stuff. They absolutely believed that I think. And so as a result of that, they absolutely push forward with a massive expansion in the killing around that time, immediately after Pearl Harbor.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to the interview I recorded in 2005 with journalist Laurence Rees, when his book \\\"Auschwitz: A New History\\\" was published.\\n\\nWhen the Nazis first began executing Jews in large numbers, they did it, really, with firing squads. What was the impact of that kind of close-quarter execution on the Germans who carried it out?\\n\\nREES: The impact for quite a substantial proportion of them was terrible. They were emotionally made distraught by this. They're having to shoot women and children at very close range. And this - thus, I believe, begins this journey to the gas chambers that we know of, the infamous gas chambers. And it's because, we see, when Himmler visits Minsk in August 1941, he's told of the emotional problems that the killing in this way, the shooting killings are doing to his men. And he puts in training, as a result, a whole series of experiments to devise a way of killing that is not so emotionally disturbing to his men.\\n\\nI'd always thought that the reason that the gas chambers were devised was primarily to kill people in large numbers. Well, it wasn't just that at all; it was actually so that there was a less emotionally stressful way that the killers could commit murder.\\n\\nDAVIES: They began initially by putting people into a - I guess, in a cabin of some kind and piping exhaust fumes into it.\\n\\nREES: That's right. Well, what happens now again - and we can see this as an example of both cumulative radicalism and competition within the Nazi state - is various people at various different locations come up with different initiatives. What happens is there's an initiative which is the gas van, which is a van where you connect the exhaust back into a compartment hermetically sealed in the rear, where people are gassed. There's the building of the - camp Belzec, which is the first stationary gas chambers, again, using large engines with carbon gases going in to gas them.\\n\\nAnd then at the same time, in September 1941, you find a totally different initiative beginning at Auschwitz, which is the only camp where this initiative begins, which is the use of Zyklon B. Zyklon B is a powerful insecticide using - used for disinfecting rooms. And it was already in Auschwitz, and they used it for delousing prisoners' clothes and rooms because they had a terrible problem with lice because of the inhumane conditions, not least, that prisoners were kept in.\\n\\nAnd one of the functionaries there thinks to himself, well, it's got printed on the Zyklon B cans - dangerous to life; don't go in the room while this is being let off. And he goes, well, actually, of course, if you want to kill people, they should be in the room. So he starts experimenting, not on Jews but on the sick and on Soviet prisoners of war at Auschwitz. And he starts with Zyklon B. The experiments go wrong to start with. They alter doses. They do experiments. And eventually, they evolve a different method of killing to the ones used in the death camps of Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec.\\n\\nDAVIES: Now, as you noted, Auschwitz was not originally conceived of as a death camp, but as a labor camp, which meant that it was large and had lots and lots of barracks. And you note that when the killings of Jews really accelerated in 1942 that this was done not so much at Auschwitz, but at three other camps - at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. And...\\n\\nDAVIES: They were specifically set up as death camps. And you made the point that when visitors go to those sites, they are always shocked at how small they are even though...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...These three camps alone accounted for 1.7 million deaths. Why were these deaths camps so small? How did they function?\\n\\nREES: Because they had no other function than killing. Auschwitz is unique in the history of the Nazi states, unique in the history of the world. It's not just the site of the largest mass murder the world's ever seen as a physical site. It's also unique in the Nazi state in that it's the only camp that combines two functions. It's both a concentration camp and a death camp, and those functions vary at different times in its history.\\n\\nWhat's happening at places like Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor is they are set up in 1942 - all of them open in 1942. They are set up purely to murder Jews. And if you plan on just - just, I say, just - murdering people, one of the shocking things is you need no real space at all. These places are a few hundred yards square - nothing left of them now because the Nazis themselves destroyed these camps in late 1943. They knew that they wanted to keep this their secret. And they were essentially places where trains would arrive, and the Jews would be taken off. And 99 - more than 99% of these people would be dead, probably, within two hours. So there was no stay of any kind, really, at all.\\n\\nA camp like Treblinka, which was capable of killing 300,000 people in little more - in around less than two months in the summer of 1942 - 300,000 people in that one small space - it was run by around 20 Germans and about 100 Ukrainian guards. And these Ukrainians had been mostly selected from prison camps. They had been people fighting on the Russian side who, in the horror of the prison camps that the Germans set up for these Russians where millions died, were offered this chance of saving themselves, to go and work on the German side.\\n\\nAnd then there was the third category of people working in these camps who were, tragically, Jews themselves. The Nazis selected, very occasionally, from incoming transports a number of fit Jewish people and forced them, on pain of their own immediate murder, to participate in the process by cutting people's hair, by showing the way to the gas chamber, by cleaning the gas chambers, by burning the bodies and so on. And the torment that these people went through is scarcely imaginable.\\n\\nDAVIES: So the actual horrific task of murder, of cleaning the bodies, of cleaning out the chambers after the killing has occurred is, by and large, not done by Germans.\\n\\nREES: Never done by Germans, really. No.\\n\\nDAVIES: Yeah. And that was true at Auschwitz as well.\\n\\nREES: So they end up at the huge, industrial-style killing factories of Auschwitz-Birkenau. You have a crematorium gas chamber complex that's capable, in the summer of 1941, of killing 10,000 people in one day - 10,000 people in one day. And it's run by between 2 to 4 Germans and around about 100 Jews. Now, the Nazis save the absolute moment of murder to themselves. They're the ones who drop the canisters of Zyklon B actually into the gas chamber. But pretty much all the other tasks involved in making this operate are run by Jewish Sonderkommando, who we know both from interviewing some - the few people who survived this and also from documents that Jewish Sonderkommando wrote and hid in the foundations of the building often at the time. The torment these people went through was practically indescribable.\\n\\nDAVIES: I was struck by your description of the arrival buildings at the death camps, that they often were fairly pleasant-looking, I mean, with flower plantings and the kind - I guess designed to reinsure the incoming inmates...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...That their fate was not what it was going to be.\\n\\nREES: Again, this is all part of the cynicism, but it's also part of the learning curve that the Nazis go on because what happens at Treblinka, which was the most deadly, if you like, of all of these death camps outside of Auschwitz - they were killing so many people that the system broke down - summer of 1942 - that the system broke down. There were bodies everywhere. There was just mayhem, people being shot. It was chaos.\\n\\nSo they actually had to shut it down and reorganize it. And the new commander of Treblinka, what he managed to do as he pushed it forward was come up with all of these devices like the fake railway station, fake timetables, lovely flowers - same thing happened at Sobibor. One of the most extraordinary individuals I've ever met, Toivi Blatt, who survived Sobibor, said, actually, when he got off there, he'd been expecting some horrible place. He said, it was always beautiful. And as you say, it's all designed so that when, say, Jews coming from Holland arrive, they're told, you are at a transit station, hygiene stop while - we just need to take a shower, have your hair cut and we're going to move on east. And it's deliberately designed to do that.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more from him after a break, and we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. Monday, January 27 is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, based on more than 100 interviews with survivors and Nazi perpetrators. It's called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nDAVIES: You note that Auschwitz became, really, a death camp at a point when the Nazi death machine had become very well-developed, and Nazi initiative and ingenuity had addressed some of the technical difficulties of mass murder and had worked out solutions. Tell us a bit about those arriving Jews who were selected for immediate death. What exactly faced them, and who did the work?\\n\\nREES: Well, they would be taken from the - by the time - in 1944, by the time this became the most sophisticated procedure, they'd be taken straight from the arrival ramp, which was the area they arrived at, directly inside Birkenau. The railway line ran into the camp. They'd be taken, really, a few hundred yards round to one of four combination gas chamber-crematoriums.\\n\\nThey would then be taken down in two - cases of two of them, they'd be taken on - all on ground level. The other two - one had basement, undressing rooms and gas chambers. They'd be taken down or into a room where they'd be told to undress because they were going to have to have a shower as part of the camp's admittance procedure. And they would then be crammed into an airtight room - the door shut, locked behind them.\\n\\nAnd then either from above, in the case of the basement gas chambers or through the windows of the ones all on the ground floor, canisters of Zyklon B would be thrown in. And it would normally - it would take - dependent on how many people were in these gas chambers, dependent on the weather because Zyklon B was more effective the warmer the air was - it would take 15, 20 minutes for these people to die, I think, a horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible death of suffocation and poisoning.\\n\\nThe gas chambers would then be opened. The Sonderkommando, Jewish - other Jewish prisoners with gas masks, would have to go in, would take out the bodies, would - in the case of the adults - go through them and take out the gold teeth, would shave the hair of the women. The bodies would then be pushed into lifts taken up to the first - to the ground level or the basement gas chambers, where the bodies would be burned. And then their ashes would be collected and either thrown in the immediate area or taken down to the nearby river, Vistula. So that was the horror of the process that they devised in the end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Were many of the SS officials who conducted the murder at Auschwitz held accountable for their actions?\\n\\nREES: Well, I think this is one of the great scandals of this story, a story rich in scandal at every level. But this is one of the greater scandals, which is that less than - well, maybe, 12%, 10% of SS people who worked at Auschwitz were ever prosecuted. Around 90% of the SS who worked at Auschwitz during the war escaped all forms of prosecution. And myself, I think that's a scandal.\\n\\nDAVIES: Why was that?\\n\\nREES: One of the reasons that so few people were prosecuted was that by the 1960s, the German prosecutors had taken the view that unless a member of the SS was absolutely directly involved in the killing or had been directly involved in acts of brutality - physical brutality - then they could get off scot-free. And of course, it meant that the way that the gas chambers had been devised, which was that so few Germans were needed for their actual physical operation, it meant that the vast majority of SS at the camp could say, oh, I wasn't really directly involved in the killing at all.\\n\\nNow, myself, I think that's a calamity. That's terrible because, of course, if you're working in the currency units counting out money, if you're working in the SS transport division, if you're a guard at the camp, you are directly involved in the operation of the camp that results - that's an extermination center. So I certainly disagree with - you know, for all the good it's going to do anybody that I disagree, but I certainly disagree that they took that view.\\n\\nDAVIES: In this book, you compare the crimes of the Holocaust to other mass exterminations in history - going as far back as Genghis Khan's genocide in Persia - and conclude that this represents the lowest act in human history and should not be allowed to recede into distant memory as some of these other mass killings have. What's different about this extermination?\\n\\nREES: I think that if you're looking at how you should think about events in the past - or even events in the present, actually - what you've got to do is look at the overall circumstances in which these things happen. You know, it's not much good thinking, well, oh, the Vikings were terrible. Well, the Vikings operated in a system of values at the time that was - they were, by all accounts from latest research on Vikings, for example, scarcely better or worse than any other 10th century marauding hordes. I mean, it's a ludicrous - it seems to me a ludicrous way to go to start blaming Vikings for being Vikings.\\n\\nSomething different is going on here. What's happening is that you are taking a cultured nation at the heart of Europe in the 20th century, long after the Enlightenment, that has adopted absolute civilized cultural values in the wake of the end of the first world war. It is a thriving, although troubled, democracy. Its take - it's got rid of all legislation against Jews. It's liberal in that regard. All of these things are going on. It's got a great written culture. It's got a great musical culture. It's got a great artistic culture. It's the place you would think would be the most civilized almost to be. And yet that very place, within a matter of years, turns into this.\\n\\nSo you've got a journey that they go on that's unlike - and it's not like the journey the Vikings go on or Genghis Khan or the plains goes on. This is not like that. This is a different journey. This is a journey from one pole - one extreme, if you like, to the other extreme. And in the process, they use 20th-century technology that they warp and adapt to this very service of mass killing. And unlike Stalin, who even at his worst, when he was deporting entire nations - the Kalmyk nations, the Crimean Tatars and so on. He's deporting whole nations to Siberia. Even Stalin isn't trying to put forward measures to eliminate them in their entirety. So something different, I think, is going on here.\\n\\nDAVIES: So many students of Nazism and the Holocaust have tried to in some way answer the question, how could this happen? You've interviewed a hundred or so survivors and war criminals from Auschwitz. Do you feel you have some new insights into that question?\\n\\nREES: I think what surprised me about this - because I never intended this career (laughter). Like, this kind of happened to me, you know, that I've been - written so much on this and made so many programs on this. And one of the reasons it's happened is because I keep thinking I'm getting close to being able to answer that properly. And as I - as I keep getting towards it, it keeps going away from me a bit more. So I think I'm a long way down the road, I hope, to being able to get to there. But I'm not there yet. Maybe it's absolutely impossible to get there.\\n\\nBut one thing I took from this was a big fear I've now got about people of absolute faith. I always thought faith of itself was - could only be a positive thing. Everyone talks about the importance of having faith. Well, these guys had faith, absolute faith. And there's one really desperately upsetting - all desperately upsetting. But ideologically, there's one desperately particularly upsetting moment where - in the book where I talk about how Himmler and Hoss most admired, as prisoners, Jehovah's Witnesses. They pointed to them and said, see that faith? That's the kind of faith we need in our fuhrer - absolute, unshakable faith.\\n\\nNow, of course, no one is equating what the Nazis did with Jehovah's Witnesses, who operate a whole creed of peace and love and so on. Absolutely. But the very notion of absolute faith is at the core of this. And so I'm beginning to start to have questions about people who - or communities that are absolutely certain about things.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, Laurence Rees, thanks so much for speaking with us.\\n\\nREES: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" After a break, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: Today we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Next, we'll hear Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016 at the age of 87. Wiesel was born in what was then Romania and was 15 when he and his family were sent from Hungary to Auschwitz in 1944. He was later moved to another camp, Buchenwald, from which he was liberated in 1945. Among his family, only two of his sisters survived the war.\\n\\nWiesel became one of the first survivors to devote his life to bearing witness to the Holocaust. His memoir, \\\"Night,\\\" was published in English in 1960, and he spent the rest of his life speaking about social injustice. Terry spoke with him in 1988 when his novel \\\"Twilight\\\" was published.\\n\\nTERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Why have you made it your life work to bear witness?\\n\\nELIE WIESEL: What else could one do, having gone through certain events? I believe a human being, if he or she wants to remain human, then he or she must do something with what we have seen, endured, witnessed. Not to live through an experience, but the experience is there - it's bad, but not to communicate it is worse.\\n\\nGROSS: You know, I think that it's almost a human instinct to let time dim memories of horror and tragedy. Have you fought that in a way? Have you tried to keep those memories alive so that you can continue to communicate about them?\\n\\nWIESEL: Naturally. I mean, naturally, the human being wants to forget pain. In this case, although, for most of those who went through the experience during the war, they want to remember more and more and more. They go deep into their own consciousness, into their own memory, trying to find more events, more faces, more eyes, more words, more sighs, more tears, more agonies. It's never enough because we feel that we have to tell the story, and no one can tell the story fully.\\n\\nGROSS: You once described Auschwitz as the defeat of the intellect that wants to find a meaning, with a capital M, in history. Do you feel that, nevertheless, you've been really spending your life trying to find some meaning of the Holocaust, some larger meaning you could tell us about man or about God?\\n\\nWIESEL: I'll tell you, all the questions I had remain open. I really don't believe that I found any answer to any one of the questions I had. I don't know the meaning. I don't know why it happened. I don't know how it happened. I still don't know anything, really. I'm trying to tell a story, and even the story cannot be told. And therefore, it cannot be communicated, and therefore, people - and deep down, I know - won't receive the testimony that we are giving. We are a very special kind of writers, those who write about that event. And I write very little about it, really. But I know that people cannot understand.\\n\\nGROSS: I think when you were in the camps, you saw some religious people stop praying and saw people who had not been observant turn to God. You had been very observant and very immersed in the religious texts when you were young, before you were deported to the concentration camps. How did your experiences and your survival in the camps change your own experience of religion?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, the change - to the extent that it occurred - did not occur there. It's afterwards that the problems became urgent. Inside that universe, we continued praying. We continued believing. We continued affirming. We needed that link with our past. It's only after the war that I began asking questions, and I began articulating a certain protest. And that protest is still with me. I am still angry at all the forces in history that provoked such a catastrophe. That doesn't mean that my faith left me or that I left fate. I try to develop a certain protest within fate.\\n\\nGROSS: Have you gone back to the religious texts that you were reading when you were young?\\n\\nWIESEL: I never stopped reading or studying. Even inside that universe, I studied. I had a teacher there with name I never knew and whose face I hardly saw. But he was a teacher, the head of a Talmudic school in Galicia. And we work together, and we studied together. I know. It's incredible.\\n\\nGROSS: This is in the camps.\\n\\nWIESEL: Inside - in Auschwitz. So we studied. They kept on studying from morning to evening. And after the war, the first thing I wanted was a book, was a Talmudic treatise. I never stopped studying. That probably saved me.\\n\\nGROSS: In your first novel, \\\"Night...\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: \\\"Night\\\" was not a novel. It was a memoir.\\n\\nGROSS: I don't know why I think of it as a novel.\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Every word...\\n\\nGROSS: I think of think of it as a very autobiographical novel, but...\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah. Well, I - then I guess I was going to ask you about your religious teacher who narrowly escaped from being murdered with hundreds or thousands of other Jews in the forest by the SS. And he somehow managed to escape and come back to your village to warn people about what was happening, and no one would listen.\\n\\nWIESEL: We didn't listen because he was a simple man. He was a beetle. Had he been an important person, I think some people would have listened. What is so extraordinary is when we remember today the silence, the indifference of so many people who were not inside the tragedy but on the other side, just imagine if we had heard on the radio Ben-Gurion from Israel or Roosevelt or Churchill telling Hungarian Jews don't go because they are killing. They're massacring. I think they would have believed them. But why should one believe a beetle, a man who came back from the other side and was telling such atrocious stories?\\n\\nGROSS: We're getting back to the question of madness. I think a lot of people in your village just assumed he'd lost his mind and was making up - you know, was having visions or something, that this couldn't possibly have happened.\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, absolutely. I myself - I was very close to him. And we spent many, many hours alone together every evening. And I would listen to him. Plus, I love to listen to stories, even to his stories, maybe especially to hear stories. But I didn't believe them.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel recorded in 1988. Wiesel died in 2016.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you do anything to mentally prepare for what was in store when your father told you that the next day the whole village was going to be deported, the whole ghetto was going to be deported?\\n\\nWIESEL: No. We didn't know. See; Hungarian Jewry was deported at such a pace. Everything came so fast. The Hungarians allowed the Germans to come in in March. The end of May, all the Jews were out already in Germany. In less than six weeks, Eichmann had managed to deport to their death more than 600,000 Jews - men, women and children. So it came very fast. And it ended very fast. We didn't have time to think.\\n\\nGROSS: You've described yourself as having been very weak and sickly when you were young. I know you think of yourself as having survived purely by chance. Did you learn things, though, to help you survive when you were in the camps?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Not at all. I was the wrong person, the wrong candidate for survival. I was always weak, as you said, and disarmed, cowardly. I would never try to do anything, which was not what I could have done or should have done. I never asked for a supplement of anything. I didn't volunteer. I was always pleased to think that I could be invisible. Not to make myself visible was my task. I don't know why I survived. I don't know how I survived. It was really by accident.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you know when you got out of the camps that you wanted to write?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, I knew that I was going to write before I entered the camps. I come from a tradition, from the Jewish tradition, we believe - which believes in words, in language, in communication. And already at the age of 12 or 13, I was writing. Of course, it wasn't good. It meant nothing, but I tried to write. I even found the manuscript. I went back to my hometown. It's not good. But I tried.\\n\\nAfterwards, I knew I would have to bear witness. Everyone who was there is a witness, and everyone who was there is a true witness. Others who are trying to speak about this subject occasionally are false witnesses. And I felt that I had to be a true witness. And therefore, I decided to wait for 10 years, not to speak about it but to use language related to these experiences until I knew that the words were true words.\\n\\nGROSS: Why 10 years? Why not five years? Why not one year? No, seriously. What made you think..\\n\\nGROSS: ...That 10 years is what you needed to really know what it was you wanted to say and what words you wanted to say it with?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, 10 is a biblical figure, I know. And the - it's a good figure, why not? I cannot tell you that I got up one morning and decided that - let's see, that five or six or seven. It entered my mind - it has to be 10. I decided 10.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you actually have an anniversary where like...\\n\\nGROSS: And that day you sat down to write.\\n\\nGROSS: And is that when you started to write \\\"Night?\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" yes. That's when I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" on April 11, 1955, which is 10 years later.\\n\\nGROSS: And looking back, do you think that this was definitely the right thing to do, to wait those 10 years? In what ways were you changed as a witness and as a writer during those 10 years?\\n\\nWIESEL: Maybe I didn't change, but the words in me changed. They grew. you know, Words have strange destiny, too. They grow, they get old, they die, they come back. Words can be turned into spears. They can be turned into prayers. It's a strange world that you are in when you deal with words.\\n\\nGROSS: In one of your essays, you wrote that after the war, you deliberately avoided all contact with Germans and that their presence sickened you physically. Did that change? And if so, what changed that?\\n\\nWIESEL: It did. But I didn't want to go back to Germany, really. I went once because I didn't want to judge people. I went once in the early '60s to do a piece for commentary. And I realized that every person I see in the street, I judge him or her asking, where was he, what did he do, how old is he, could I - could he have been there? And I didn't want that role, so I didn't go back. But I did go back last year in '86, '87.\\n\\nToday, you have a young generation of Germans. And I do not believe in collective guilt. So I have absolutely no problem with the young Germans. I even feel sorry for the young Germans because to be maybe sons or daughters of killers is different than to be sons and daughters of the victims. And I felt sorry for them. I still do.\\n\\nGROSS: The generations of survivors are getting older. The older generation of survivors is no longer with us. Are you concerned about what's going to happen after the generations of survivors pass on, like, who will be around to actually speak the memories?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, I'm profoundly concerned, naturally. In one of my novels, I try to describe that feeling of the last survivor, what it means to be the very last. And I would not want to be that last survivor. But on the other hand, we are leaving a legacy. We are bequeathing a certain message, a certain story. This tragedy is the most documented tragedy in recorded history.

I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Monday, January 27, is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Today we're going to listen to two interviews. In a bit, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016. But first, we'll listen to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, the site of history's largest mass murder, as well as insights into Hitler's campaign of genocide against the Jews of Europe.\\n\\nRees' book is based on more than a hundred interviews with Auschwitz survivors and Nazi perpetrators, many of whom spoke on the record for the first time. He believes his search for the truth was aided by the fact that surviving Nazis had reached an age where candor no longer jeopardized careers and by the fall of communism, which opened up a wealth of new archival material. His book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nLAURENCE REES: Thank you very much.\\n\\nDAVIES: You note early in this book that you were one of relatively few people who've been able to interview quite a number of war criminals from three of the great totalitarian powers of the 20th century - that is, Stalinist Russia, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. And you say in this book that having done so, you can confirm that Nazi war criminals that you met were different from the other two.\\n\\nDAVIES: How were they different?\\n\\nREES: They're different in a kind of paradoxical way because when I grew up at school and first heard about the Nazis and - the whole line that was taken then in the '70s was that Nazi war criminals would give us the standard defense. Oh, I was only - I was acting under orders. I was acting under orders. And so that was kind of what you imagine, when you meet people like this, they're going to say. Well, paradoxically, that was the kind of response I got from Stalin's secret policemen, from members of the Imperial Army who committed terrible crimes in China and in the Pacific War. That was what they were saying. I didn't tend to get that from Nazi war criminals. The frightening thing to me - particularly frightening - was that most of the Nazi war criminals I've met actually, when you push them, say, well - and you say, well, why were you doing this - don't say, I was acting on your orders. Say, well, at the time, I thought what I was doing was right.\\n\\nDAVIES: And what do you attribute that to? I mean, they seemed to be true believers in the cause.\\n\\nREES: I think it's a variety of things that, in the end, for me, mean that Nazism is more horrible but more interesting as a phenomenon. I think it's to do with the fact that, certainly, if you were a secret policeman in Stalin's Russia, I think for the most part, the terror was so ubiquitous that no one was safe from the knock at the door. No one could really understand exactly why individuals were sometimes being targeted. Stalin famously had one of his own Politburo, Molotov's wife, tortured. I've talked to people who were at meetings where they stood up and were denouncing other people as enemies of the state because they were worried they'd be denounced. There didn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to some of this. So this means that the only way of making sense of it, really, for a lot of these people doing the bad things was to say, well, you know, I was doing it because I'm ordered to do it.\\n\\nSimilarly, in Imperial Japan, the level of training - the brutality of the training of Japanese soldiers, I think, is without parallel in the modern world, what these people were put through in training - bullying, the vicious beatings and so on, the indoctrination as well. But it was such that if you didn't - you know, you obeyed, and you obeyed blindly, I think, in a number of cases.\\n\\nWhat's going on in Germany is rather different. What's going on in Germany is that - I think to some extent thanks to the work of Goebbels, who - again, a horrible, nasty person, but the genius of propaganda of the 20th century. Thanks to the work of Goebbels, but also thanks to the fact that there was a genuine feeling of injustice in Germany after the end of the First World War. There was a feeling put about that Jews were to blame. There was a feeling of fear of communism, that Jews were somehow falsely attributed in their totality to communism. Simultaneously, Jews were thought to be running Roosevelt in American politics, anti-German and so on. So there were a whole series of what they took to be, at the time, pragmatic, positive reasons to do what they were doing, and that's one of the frightening things about it.\\n\\nDAVIES: When the Nazis spoke of achieving the Final Solution to the Jewish problem in the early years of the war, is it clear they meant extermination of the Jews?\\n\\nREES: No, they didn't mean extermination, I don't believe. It's clear that the words Final Solution change in meaning, I believe, during 1941. When Heydrich is charged by Goring with organizing the Final Solution to the Jewish problem, initially, the order explicitly states evacuation. And that was the overt policy, certainly, since 1938 and the Anschluss with Austria. When the German troops go into Austria, they, under Eichmann of the SS of - you know, later absolutely infamous for being one of the organizers of the murders in the Final Solution - he organizes a system of expropriation, of robbing, of treating violently the Jews of Vienna, robbing them and then those who can almost pay to go, expelling them.\\n\\nI think that what's clear is that Hitler always hated the Jews. He always loathed the Jews. He always wanted rid of the Jews in one way or another. The form that that wanting rid of would take varied at different points. The Final Solution, therefore, varied, I think, at different points. And certainly, at the beginning of the war, the Final Solution, I think, to the Jewish problem is one as they see it. I mean, horrible to use this language. It's not a problem. It's the problem of their mentality. But as they described it, the Jewish problem - the way to, quote, \\\"solve,\\\" unquote, this was by evacuation.\\n\\nDAVIES: It's remarkable that you find places where people talk about the notion of mass killings as being uncivilized and un-German.\\n\\nREES: Yes, that's right. Both Heydrich and Himmler say that in the - 1940. And so we know, I think, beyond reasonable doubt that the Final Solution does not mean extermination because in - actually on paper, Himmler and Heydrich are talking about extermination as being uncivilized when later on openly, at his speech at Poznan in 1943, Himmler is talking about physical extermination. Something changes.\\n\\nAnd again, we know that from the documents that - and from eyewitness testimony that in the summer of 1940, they had this - what it seems now at this distance - utterly outlandish, insane plan to transport Jews to Madagascar, the island of Madagascar of Africa. What they anticipated, the Nazis, was that the war was going to end in 1940. Britain would make peace, and they had - would have the French colonies at their disposal, including Madagascar. And the Jews would be able in French ships probably to be shipped there, which is why they were herded into ghettos. Ghettos were only ever seen as a temporary measure prior to expulsion.\\n\\nBut again, as you see time and again in this terrible history, things don't go the way the Nazis want. They're constantly - really, they're always constantly thinking the war's going to end. They keep thinking, any minute now, any moment now, the war's going to stop. We'll have won, and we'll be able to deal with this in this way. And it never does end when they think it's going to end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, the development of this notion of a Final Solution from being the evacuation of Jews to the extermination of Jews you sort of describe as a process of increasing radicalization. Now...\\n\\nDAVIES: What does this mean?\\n\\nREES: So I think one of the best examples of this cumulative radicalization, of the Nazis responding brutally to crises that they themselves have created, occurs in the Lodz ghetto, where what happens is that the Jews have been imprisoned. They've been forced to give up their money to buy food. They've run out of money, so they begin to starve. So then Nazi functionaries face a choice. Some say, let them all starve. Others say, no, no. We need to get something from these people, exploit them. That view prevails. They put them to work in horrible conditions, of course, and they pay them a tiny pittance. But those who are working can actually feed themselves a bit. Other people - the old people, children - are suffering terribly and still starving.\\n\\nAnd actually, one Nazi functionary looks at this situation they themselves have created and can - and writes a note saying, wouldn't it be more humane to kill these people rather than let them starve? So that's an example of how they end up in this position that they themselves have created, where they almost - where someone has the obscenity to write that it's more humane to kill somebody than to leave them to starve.\\n\\nDAVIES: So it's done with this utterly immoral idea of herding people into ghettos with the idea you will transport them out. When you can't transport them out...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...They begin to starve. And one thing leads to another, and then you've come to this utterly horrific conclusion that...\\n\\nREES: Yes. And so what...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...You have to kill people - hundreds of thousands.\\n\\nREES: And also you see - exactly. And what's going on in the minds of a lot of these Nazis - unbelievably, we might think today, rightly - is a sense of annoyance and indignation as - that the Jews have brought this on themselves because the war is still going on, and they can't be expelled.\\n\\nSo I've heard Nazis say - and seen it - that they say, oh, well, of course Churchill is controlled by the Jews. That's why they'd - the British don't do the logical, sensible thing in 1940 and make peace with us.\\n\\nwe're still trapped in this war, and we're in the war as a result of what the Jews are doing. And if the war had gone - if the war had ended, we'd been able to expel the Jews somewhere - where incidentally they would probably have had some form of genocidal horror awaiting them anyway - but they would have been expelled somewhere, and now we can't expel them. What are we supposed to do with them?\\n\\nAnd so this is the kind of mentality that you hear and you see it absolutely plainly now, I think, as a result of a lot of new research around Pearl Harbor, that there are killings going on before Pearl Harbor, notably in Eastern Europe and behind the lines in the war against the Soviet Union. But there's nothing - there is no major death camping operation. But what happens is, as soon as Pearl Harbor happens, you see Hitler's rhetoric change. And he starts talking about, right now it's a world war, and you remember my prophecy of 1939, in which he stated if the Jews succeed in causing a world war, the result will be their annihilation.\\n\\nHe sees this as a fulfillment of a prophecy. He said, if the Jews get involved and cause a world war - America coming into the war is de facto a world war. They simultaneously think the Jews are not just behind Stalin and - but they're behind Roosevelt as well. It's pathological, this stuff. They absolutely believed that I think. And so as a result of that, they absolutely push forward with a massive expansion in the killing around that time, immediately after Pearl Harbor.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to the interview I recorded in 2005 with journalist Laurence Rees, when his book \\\"Auschwitz: A New History\\\" was published.\\n\\nWhen the Nazis first began executing Jews in large numbers, they did it, really, with firing squads. What was the impact of that kind of close-quarter execution on the Germans who carried it out?\\n\\nREES: The impact for quite a substantial proportion of them was terrible. They were emotionally made distraught by this. They're having to shoot women and children at very close range. And this - thus, I believe, begins this journey to the gas chambers that we know of, the infamous gas chambers. And it's because, we see, when Himmler visits Minsk in August 1941, he's told of the emotional problems that the killing in this way, the shooting killings are doing to his men. And he puts in training, as a result, a whole series of experiments to devise a way of killing that is not so emotionally disturbing to his men.\\n\\nI'd always thought that the reason that the gas chambers were devised was primarily to kill people in large numbers. Well, it wasn't just that at all; it was actually so that there was a less emotionally stressful way that the killers could commit murder.\\n\\nDAVIES: They began initially by putting people into a - I guess, in a cabin of some kind and piping exhaust fumes into it.\\n\\nREES: That's right. Well, what happens now again - and we can see this as an example of both cumulative radicalism and competition within the Nazi state - is various people at various different locations come up with different initiatives. What happens is there's an initiative which is the gas van, which is a van where you connect the exhaust back into a compartment hermetically sealed in the rear, where people are gassed. There's the building of the - camp Belzec, which is the first stationary gas chambers, again, using large engines with carbon gases going in to gas them.\\n\\nAnd then at the same time, in September 1941, you find a totally different initiative beginning at Auschwitz, which is the only camp where this initiative begins, which is the use of Zyklon B. Zyklon B is a powerful insecticide using - used for disinfecting rooms. And it was already in Auschwitz, and they used it for delousing prisoners' clothes and rooms because they had a terrible problem with lice because of the inhumane conditions, not least, that prisoners were kept in.\\n\\nAnd one of the functionaries there thinks to himself, well, it's got printed on the Zyklon B cans - dangerous to life; don't go in the room while this is being let off. And he goes, well, actually, of course, if you want to kill people, they should be in the room. So he starts experimenting, not on Jews but on the sick and on Soviet prisoners of war at Auschwitz. And he starts with Zyklon B. The experiments go wrong to start with. They alter doses. They do experiments. And eventually, they evolve a different method of killing to the ones used in the death camps of Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec.\\n\\nDAVIES: Now, as you noted, Auschwitz was not originally conceived of as a death camp, but as a labor camp, which meant that it was large and had lots and lots of barracks. And you note that when the killings of Jews really accelerated in 1942 that this was done not so much at Auschwitz, but at three other camps - at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. And...\\n\\nDAVIES: They were specifically set up as death camps. And you made the point that when visitors go to those sites, they are always shocked at how small they are even though...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...These three camps alone accounted for 1.7 million deaths. Why were these deaths camps so small? How did they function?\\n\\nREES: Because they had no other function than killing. Auschwitz is unique in the history of the Nazi states, unique in the history of the world. It's not just the site of the largest mass murder the world's ever seen as a physical site. It's also unique in the Nazi state in that it's the only camp that combines two functions. It's both a concentration camp and a death camp, and those functions vary at different times in its history.\\n\\nWhat's happening at places like Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor is they are set up in 1942 - all of them open in 1942. They are set up purely to murder Jews. And if you plan on just - just, I say, just - murdering people, one of the shocking things is you need no real space at all. These places are a few hundred yards square - nothing left of them now because the Nazis themselves destroyed these camps in late 1943. They knew that they wanted to keep this their secret. And they were essentially places where trains would arrive, and the Jews would be taken off. And 99 - more than 99% of these people would be dead, probably, within two hours. So there was no stay of any kind, really, at all.\\n\\nA camp like Treblinka, which was capable of killing 300,000 people in little more - in around less than two months in the summer of 1942 - 300,000 people in that one small space - it was run by around 20 Germans and about 100 Ukrainian guards. And these Ukrainians had been mostly selected from prison camps. They had been people fighting on the Russian side who, in the horror of the prison camps that the Germans set up for these Russians where millions died, were offered this chance of saving themselves, to go and work on the German side.\\n\\nAnd then there was the third category of people working in these camps who were, tragically, Jews themselves. The Nazis selected, very occasionally, from incoming transports a number of fit Jewish people and forced them, on pain of their own immediate murder, to participate in the process by cutting people's hair, by showing the way to the gas chamber, by cleaning the gas chambers, by burning the bodies and so on. And the torment that these people went through is scarcely imaginable.\\n\\nDAVIES: So the actual horrific task of murder, of cleaning the bodies, of cleaning out the chambers after the killing has occurred is, by and large, not done by Germans.\\n\\nREES: Never done by Germans, really. No.\\n\\nDAVIES: Yeah. And that was true at Auschwitz as well.\\n\\nREES: So they end up at the huge, industrial-style killing factories of Auschwitz-Birkenau. You have a crematorium gas chamber complex that's capable, in the summer of 1941, of killing 10,000 people in one day - 10,000 people in one day. And it's run by between 2 to 4 Germans and around about 100 Jews. Now, the Nazis save the absolute moment of murder to themselves. They're the ones who drop the canisters of Zyklon B actually into the gas chamber. But pretty much all the other tasks involved in making this operate are run by Jewish Sonderkommando, who we know both from interviewing some - the few people who survived this and also from documents that Jewish Sonderkommando wrote and hid in the foundations of the building often at the time. The torment these people went through was practically indescribable.\\n\\nDAVIES: I was struck by your description of the arrival buildings at the death camps, that they often were fairly pleasant-looking, I mean, with flower plantings and the kind - I guess designed to reinsure the incoming inmates...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...That their fate was not what it was going to be.\\n\\nREES: Again, this is all part of the cynicism, but it's also part of the learning curve that the Nazis go on because what happens at Treblinka, which was the most deadly, if you like, of all of these death camps outside of Auschwitz - they were killing so many people that the system broke down - summer of 1942 - that the system broke down. There were bodies everywhere. There was just mayhem, people being shot. It was chaos.\\n\\nSo they actually had to shut it down and reorganize it. And the new commander of Treblinka, what he managed to do as he pushed it forward was come up with all of these devices like the fake railway station, fake timetables, lovely flowers - same thing happened at Sobibor. One of the most extraordinary individuals I've ever met, Toivi Blatt, who survived Sobibor, said, actually, when he got off there, he'd been expecting some horrible place. He said, it was always beautiful. And as you say, it's all designed so that when, say, Jews coming from Holland arrive, they're told, you are at a transit station, hygiene stop while - we just need to take a shower, have your hair cut and we're going to move on east. And it's deliberately designed to do that.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more from him after a break, and we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. Monday, January 27 is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, based on more than 100 interviews with survivors and Nazi perpetrators. It's called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nDAVIES: You note that Auschwitz became, really, a death camp at a point when the Nazi death machine had become very well-developed, and Nazi initiative and ingenuity had addressed some of the technical difficulties of mass murder and had worked out solutions. Tell us a bit about those arriving Jews who were selected for immediate death. What exactly faced them, and who did the work?\\n\\nREES: Well, they would be taken from the - by the time - in 1944, by the time this became the most sophisticated procedure, they'd be taken straight from the arrival ramp, which was the area they arrived at, directly inside Birkenau. The railway line ran into the camp. They'd be taken, really, a few hundred yards round to one of four combination gas chamber-crematoriums.\\n\\nThey would then be taken down in two - cases of two of them, they'd be taken on - all on ground level. The other two - one had basement, undressing rooms and gas chambers. They'd be taken down or into a room where they'd be told to undress because they were going to have to have a shower as part of the camp's admittance procedure. And they would then be crammed into an airtight room - the door shut, locked behind them.\\n\\nAnd then either from above, in the case of the basement gas chambers or through the windows of the ones all on the ground floor, canisters of Zyklon B would be thrown in. And it would normally - it would take - dependent on how many people were in these gas chambers, dependent on the weather because Zyklon B was more effective the warmer the air was - it would take 15, 20 minutes for these people to die, I think, a horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible death of suffocation and poisoning.\\n\\nThe gas chambers would then be opened. The Sonderkommando, Jewish - other Jewish prisoners with gas masks, would have to go in, would take out the bodies, would - in the case of the adults - go through them and take out the gold teeth, would shave the hair of the women. The bodies would then be pushed into lifts taken up to the first - to the ground level or the basement gas chambers, where the bodies would be burned. And then their ashes would be collected and either thrown in the immediate area or taken down to the nearby river, Vistula. So that was the horror of the process that they devised in the end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Were many of the SS officials who conducted the murder at Auschwitz held accountable for their actions?\\n\\nREES: Well, I think this is one of the great scandals of this story, a story rich in scandal at every level. But this is one of the greater scandals, which is that less than - well, maybe, 12%, 10% of SS people who worked at Auschwitz were ever prosecuted. Around 90% of the SS who worked at Auschwitz during the war escaped all forms of prosecution. And myself, I think that's a scandal.\\n\\nDAVIES: Why was that?\\n\\nREES: One of the reasons that so few people were prosecuted was that by the 1960s, the German prosecutors had taken the view that unless a member of the SS was absolutely directly involved in the killing or had been directly involved in acts of brutality - physical brutality - then they could get off scot-free. And of course, it meant that the way that the gas chambers had been devised, which was that so few Germans were needed for their actual physical operation, it meant that the vast majority of SS at the camp could say, oh, I wasn't really directly involved in the killing at all.\\n\\nNow, myself, I think that's a calamity. That's terrible because, of course, if you're working in the currency units counting out money, if you're working in the SS transport division, if you're a guard at the camp, you are directly involved in the operation of the camp that results - that's an extermination center. So I certainly disagree with - you know, for all the good it's going to do anybody that I disagree, but I certainly disagree that they took that view.\\n\\nDAVIES: In this book, you compare the crimes of the Holocaust to other mass exterminations in history - going as far back as Genghis Khan's genocide in Persia - and conclude that this represents the lowest act in human history and should not be allowed to recede into distant memory as some of these other mass killings have. What's different about this extermination?\\n\\nREES: I think that if you're looking at how you should think about events in the past - or even events in the present, actually - what you've got to do is look at the overall circumstances in which these things happen. You know, it's not much good thinking, well, oh, the Vikings were terrible. Well, the Vikings operated in a system of values at the time that was - they were, by all accounts from latest research on Vikings, for example, scarcely better or worse than any other 10th century marauding hordes. I mean, it's a ludicrous - it seems to me a ludicrous way to go to start blaming Vikings for being Vikings.\\n\\nSomething different is going on here. What's happening is that you are taking a cultured nation at the heart of Europe in the 20th century, long after the Enlightenment, that has adopted absolute civilized cultural values in the wake of the end of the first world war. It is a thriving, although troubled, democracy. Its take - it's got rid of all legislation against Jews. It's liberal in that regard. All of these things are going on. It's got a great written culture. It's got a great musical culture. It's got a great artistic culture. It's the place you would think would be the most civilized almost to be. And yet that very place, within a matter of years, turns into this.\\n\\nSo you've got a journey that they go on that's unlike - and it's not like the journey the Vikings go on or Genghis Khan or the plains goes on. This is not like that. This is a different journey. This is a journey from one pole - one extreme, if you like, to the other extreme. And in the process, they use 20th-century technology that they warp and adapt to this very service of mass killing. And unlike Stalin, who even at his worst, when he was deporting entire nations - the Kalmyk nations, the Crimean Tatars and so on. He's deporting whole nations to Siberia. Even Stalin isn't trying to put forward measures to eliminate them in their entirety. So something different, I think, is going on here.\\n\\nDAVIES: So many students of Nazism and the Holocaust have tried to in some way answer the question, how could this happen? You've interviewed a hundred or so survivors and war criminals from Auschwitz. Do you feel you have some new insights into that question?\\n\\nREES: I think what surprised me about this - because I never intended this career (laughter). Like, this kind of happened to me, you know, that I've been - written so much on this and made so many programs on this. And one of the reasons it's happened is because I keep thinking I'm getting close to being able to answer that properly. And as I - as I keep getting towards it, it keeps going away from me a bit more. So I think I'm a long way down the road, I hope, to being able to get to there. But I'm not there yet. Maybe it's absolutely impossible to get there.\\n\\nBut one thing I took from this was a big fear I've now got about people of absolute faith. I always thought faith of itself was - could only be a positive thing. Everyone talks about the importance of having faith. Well, these guys had faith, absolute faith. And there's one really desperately upsetting - all desperately upsetting. But ideologically, there's one desperately particularly upsetting moment where - in the book where I talk about how Himmler and Hoss most admired, as prisoners, Jehovah's Witnesses. They pointed to them and said, see that faith? That's the kind of faith we need in our fuhrer - absolute, unshakable faith.\\n\\nNow, of course, no one is equating what the Nazis did with Jehovah's Witnesses, who operate a whole creed of peace and love and so on. Absolutely. But the very notion of absolute faith is at the core of this. And so I'm beginning to start to have questions about people who - or communities that are absolutely certain about things.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, Laurence Rees, thanks so much for speaking with us.\\n\\nREES: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" After a break, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: Today we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Next, we'll hear Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016 at the age of 87. Wiesel was born in what was then Romania and was 15 when he and his family were sent from Hungary to Auschwitz in 1944. He was later moved to another camp, Buchenwald, from which he was liberated in 1945. Among his family, only two of his sisters survived the war.\\n\\nWiesel became one of the first survivors to devote his life to bearing witness to the Holocaust. His memoir, \\\"Night,\\\" was published in English in 1960, and he spent the rest of his life speaking about social injustice. Terry spoke with him in 1988 when his novel \\\"Twilight\\\" was published.\\n\\nTERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Why have you made it your life work to bear witness?\\n\\nELIE WIESEL: What else could one do, having gone through certain events? I believe a human being, if he or she wants to remain human, then he or she must do something with what we have seen, endured, witnessed. Not to live through an experience, but the experience is there - it's bad, but not to communicate it is worse.\\n\\nGROSS: You know, I think that it's almost a human instinct to let time dim memories of horror and tragedy. Have you fought that in a way? Have you tried to keep those memories alive so that you can continue to communicate about them?\\n\\nWIESEL: Naturally. I mean, naturally, the human being wants to forget pain. In this case, although, for most of those who went through the experience during the war, they want to remember more and more and more. They go deep into their own consciousness, into their own memory, trying to find more events, more faces, more eyes, more words, more sighs, more tears, more agonies. It's never enough because we feel that we have to tell the story, and no one can tell the story fully.\\n\\nGROSS: You once described Auschwitz as the defeat of the intellect that wants to find a meaning, with a capital M, in history. Do you feel that, nevertheless, you've been really spending your life trying to find some meaning of the Holocaust, some larger meaning you could tell us about man or about God?\\n\\nWIESEL: I'll tell you, all the questions I had remain open. I really don't believe that I found any answer to any one of the questions I had. I don't know the meaning. I don't know why it happened. I don't know how it happened. I still don't know anything, really. I'm trying to tell a story, and even the story cannot be told. And therefore, it cannot be communicated, and therefore, people - and deep down, I know - won't receive the testimony that we are giving. We are a very special kind of writers, those who write about that event. And I write very little about it, really. But I know that people cannot understand.\\n\\nGROSS: I think when you were in the camps, you saw some religious people stop praying and saw people who had not been observant turn to God. You had been very observant and very immersed in the religious texts when you were young, before you were deported to the concentration camps. How did your experiences and your survival in the camps change your own experience of religion?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, the change - to the extent that it occurred - did not occur there. It's afterwards that the problems became urgent. Inside that universe, we continued praying. We continued believing. We continued affirming. We needed that link with our past. It's only after the war that I began asking questions, and I began articulating a certain protest. And that protest is still with me. I am still angry at all the forces in history that provoked such a catastrophe. That doesn't mean that my faith left me or that I left fate. I try to develop a certain protest within fate.\\n\\nGROSS: Have you gone back to the religious texts that you were reading when you were young?\\n\\nWIESEL: I never stopped reading or studying. Even inside that universe, I studied. I had a teacher there with name I never knew and whose face I hardly saw. But he was a teacher, the head of a Talmudic school in Galicia. And we work together, and we studied together. I know. It's incredible.\\n\\nGROSS: This is in the camps.\\n\\nWIESEL: Inside - in Auschwitz. So we studied. They kept on studying from morning to evening. And after the war, the first thing I wanted was a book, was a Talmudic treatise. I never stopped studying. That probably saved me.\\n\\nGROSS: In your first novel, \\\"Night...\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: \\\"Night\\\" was not a novel. It was a memoir.\\n\\nGROSS: I don't know why I think of it as a novel.\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Every word...\\n\\nGROSS: I think of think of it as a very autobiographical novel, but...\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah. Well, I - then I guess I was going to ask you about your religious teacher who narrowly escaped from being murdered with hundreds or thousands of other Jews in the forest by the SS. And he somehow managed to escape and come back to your village to warn people about what was happening, and no one would listen.\\n\\nWIESEL: We didn't listen because he was a simple man. He was a beetle. Had he been an important person, I think some people would have listened. What is so extraordinary is when we remember today the silence, the indifference of so many people who were not inside the tragedy but on the other side, just imagine if we had heard on the radio Ben-Gurion from Israel or Roosevelt or Churchill telling Hungarian Jews don't go because they are killing. They're massacring. I think they would have believed them. But why should one believe a beetle, a man who came back from the other side and was telling such atrocious stories?\\n\\nGROSS: We're getting back to the question of madness. I think a lot of people in your village just assumed he'd lost his mind and was making up - you know, was having visions or something, that this couldn't possibly have happened.\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, absolutely. I myself - I was very close to him. And we spent many, many hours alone together every evening. And I would listen to him. Plus, I love to listen to stories, even to his stories, maybe especially to hear stories. But I didn't believe them.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel recorded in 1988. Wiesel died in 2016.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you do anything to mentally prepare for what was in store when your father told you that the next day the whole village was going to be deported, the whole ghetto was going to be deported?\\n\\nWIESEL: No. We didn't know. See; Hungarian Jewry was deported at such a pace. Everything came so fast. The Hungarians allowed the Germans to come in in March. The end of May, all the Jews were out already in Germany. In less than six weeks, Eichmann had managed to deport to their death more than 600,000 Jews - men, women and children. So it came very fast. And it ended very fast. We didn't have time to think.\\n\\nGROSS: You've described yourself as having been very weak and sickly when you were young. I know you think of yourself as having survived purely by chance. Did you learn things, though, to help you survive when you were in the camps?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Not at all. I was the wrong person, the wrong candidate for survival. I was always weak, as you said, and disarmed, cowardly. I would never try to do anything, which was not what I could have done or should have done. I never asked for a supplement of anything. I didn't volunteer. I was always pleased to think that I could be invisible. Not to make myself visible was my task. I don't know why I survived. I don't know how I survived. It was really by accident.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you know when you got out of the camps that you wanted to write?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, I knew that I was going to write before I entered the camps. I come from a tradition, from the Jewish tradition, we believe - which believes in words, in language, in communication. And already at the age of 12 or 13, I was writing. Of course, it wasn't good. It meant nothing, but I tried to write. I even found the manuscript. I went back to my hometown. It's not good. But I tried.\\n\\nAfterwards, I knew I would have to bear witness. Everyone who was there is a witness, and everyone who was there is a true witness. Others who are trying to speak about this subject occasionally are false witnesses. And I felt that I had to be a true witness. And therefore, I decided to wait for 10 years, not to speak about it but to use language related to these experiences until I knew that the words were true words.\\n\\nGROSS: Why 10 years? Why not five years? Why not one year? No, seriously. What made you think..\\n\\nGROSS: ...That 10 years is what you needed to really know what it was you wanted to say and what words you wanted to say it with?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, 10 is a biblical figure, I know. And the - it's a good figure, why not? I cannot tell you that I got up one morning and decided that - let's see, that five or six or seven. It entered my mind - it has to be 10. I decided 10.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you actually have an anniversary where like...\\n\\nGROSS: And that day you sat down to write.\\n\\nGROSS: And is that when you started to write \\\"Night?\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" yes. That's when I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" on April 11, 1955, which is 10 years later.\\n\\nGROSS: And looking back, do you think that this was definitely the right thing to do, to wait those 10 years? In what ways were you changed as a witness and as a writer during those 10 years?\\n\\nWIESEL: Maybe I didn't change, but the words in me changed. They grew. you know, Words have strange destiny, too. They grow, they get old, they die, they come back. Words can be turned into spears. They can be turned into prayers. It's a strange world that you are in when you deal with words.\\n\\nGROSS: In one of your essays, you wrote that after the war, you deliberately avoided all contact with Germans and that their presence sickened you physically. Did that change? And if so, what changed that?\\n\\nWIESEL: It did. But I didn't want to go back to Germany, really. I went once because I didn't want to judge people. I went once in the early '60s to do a piece for commentary. And I realized that every person I see in the street, I judge him or her asking, where was he, what did he do, how old is he, could I - could he have been there? And I didn't want that role, so I didn't go back. But I did go back last year in '86, '87.\\n\\nToday, you have a young generation of Germans. And I do not believe in collective guilt. So I have absolutely no problem with the young Germans. I even feel sorry for the young Germans because to be maybe sons or daughters of killers is different than to be sons and daughters of the victims. And I felt sorry for them. I still do.\\n\\nGROSS: The generations of survivors are getting older. The older generation of survivors is no longer with us. Are you concerned about what's going to happen after the generations of survivors pass on, like, who will be around to actually speak the memories?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, I'm profoundly concerned, naturally. In one of my novels, I try to describe that feeling of the last survivor, what it means to be the very last. And I would not want to be that last survivor. But on the other hand, we are leaving a legacy. We are bequeathing a certain message, a certain story. This tragedy is the most documented tragedy in recorded history. And therefore later on, if there will be a later on, anyone wishing to know will know where to go for knowledge.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988.

I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Monday, January 27, is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Today we're going to listen to two interviews. In a bit, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016. But first, we'll listen to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, the site of history's largest mass murder, as well as insights into Hitler's campaign of genocide against the Jews of Europe.\\n\\nRees' book is based on more than a hundred interviews with Auschwitz survivors and Nazi perpetrators, many of whom spoke on the record for the first time. He believes his search for the truth was aided by the fact that surviving Nazis had reached an age where candor no longer jeopardized careers and by the fall of communism, which opened up a wealth of new archival material. His book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nLAURENCE REES: Thank you very much.\\n\\nDAVIES: You note early in this book that you were one of relatively few people who've been able to interview quite a number of war criminals from three of the great totalitarian powers of the 20th century - that is, Stalinist Russia, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. And you say in this book that having done so, you can confirm that Nazi war criminals that you met were different from the other two.\\n\\nDAVIES: How were they different?\\n\\nREES: They're different in a kind of paradoxical way because when I grew up at school and first heard about the Nazis and - the whole line that was taken then in the '70s was that Nazi war criminals would give us the standard defense. Oh, I was only - I was acting under orders. I was acting under orders. And so that was kind of what you imagine, when you meet people like this, they're going to say. Well, paradoxically, that was the kind of response I got from Stalin's secret policemen, from members of the Imperial Army who committed terrible crimes in China and in the Pacific War. That was what they were saying. I didn't tend to get that from Nazi war criminals. The frightening thing to me - particularly frightening - was that most of the Nazi war criminals I've met actually, when you push them, say, well - and you say, well, why were you doing this - don't say, I was acting on your orders. Say, well, at the time, I thought what I was doing was right.\\n\\nDAVIES: And what do you attribute that to? I mean, they seemed to be true believers in the cause.\\n\\nREES: I think it's a variety of things that, in the end, for me, mean that Nazism is more horrible but more interesting as a phenomenon. I think it's to do with the fact that, certainly, if you were a secret policeman in Stalin's Russia, I think for the most part, the terror was so ubiquitous that no one was safe from the knock at the door. No one could really understand exactly why individuals were sometimes being targeted. Stalin famously had one of his own Politburo, Molotov's wife, tortured. I've talked to people who were at meetings where they stood up and were denouncing other people as enemies of the state because they were worried they'd be denounced. There didn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to some of this. So this means that the only way of making sense of it, really, for a lot of these people doing the bad things was to say, well, you know, I was doing it because I'm ordered to do it.\\n\\nSimilarly, in Imperial Japan, the level of training - the brutality of the training of Japanese soldiers, I think, is without parallel in the modern world, what these people were put through in training - bullying, the vicious beatings and so on, the indoctrination as well. But it was such that if you didn't - you know, you obeyed, and you obeyed blindly, I think, in a number of cases.\\n\\nWhat's going on in Germany is rather different. What's going on in Germany is that - I think to some extent thanks to the work of Goebbels, who - again, a horrible, nasty person, but the genius of propaganda of the 20th century. Thanks to the work of Goebbels, but also thanks to the fact that there was a genuine feeling of injustice in Germany after the end of the First World War. There was a feeling put about that Jews were to blame. There was a feeling of fear of communism, that Jews were somehow falsely attributed in their totality to communism. Simultaneously, Jews were thought to be running Roosevelt in American politics, anti-German and so on. So there were a whole series of what they took to be, at the time, pragmatic, positive reasons to do what they were doing, and that's one of the frightening things about it.\\n\\nDAVIES: When the Nazis spoke of achieving the Final Solution to the Jewish problem in the early years of the war, is it clear they meant extermination of the Jews?\\n\\nREES: No, they didn't mean extermination, I don't believe. It's clear that the words Final Solution change in meaning, I believe, during 1941. When Heydrich is charged by Goring with organizing the Final Solution to the Jewish problem, initially, the order explicitly states evacuation. And that was the overt policy, certainly, since 1938 and the Anschluss with Austria. When the German troops go into Austria, they, under Eichmann of the SS of - you know, later absolutely infamous for being one of the organizers of the murders in the Final Solution - he organizes a system of expropriation, of robbing, of treating violently the Jews of Vienna, robbing them and then those who can almost pay to go, expelling them.\\n\\nI think that what's clear is that Hitler always hated the Jews. He always loathed the Jews. He always wanted rid of the Jews in one way or another. The form that that wanting rid of would take varied at different points. The Final Solution, therefore, varied, I think, at different points. And certainly, at the beginning of the war, the Final Solution, I think, to the Jewish problem is one as they see it. I mean, horrible to use this language. It's not a problem. It's the problem of their mentality. But as they described it, the Jewish problem - the way to, quote, \\\"solve,\\\" unquote, this was by evacuation.\\n\\nDAVIES: It's remarkable that you find places where people talk about the notion of mass killings as being uncivilized and un-German.\\n\\nREES: Yes, that's right. Both Heydrich and Himmler say that in the - 1940. And so we know, I think, beyond reasonable doubt that the Final Solution does not mean extermination because in - actually on paper, Himmler and Heydrich are talking about extermination as being uncivilized when later on openly, at his speech at Poznan in 1943, Himmler is talking about physical extermination. Something changes.\\n\\nAnd again, we know that from the documents that - and from eyewitness testimony that in the summer of 1940, they had this - what it seems now at this distance - utterly outlandish, insane plan to transport Jews to Madagascar, the island of Madagascar of Africa. What they anticipated, the Nazis, was that the war was going to end in 1940. Britain would make peace, and they had - would have the French colonies at their disposal, including Madagascar. And the Jews would be able in French ships probably to be shipped there, which is why they were herded into ghettos. Ghettos were only ever seen as a temporary measure prior to expulsion.\\n\\nBut again, as you see time and again in this terrible history, things don't go the way the Nazis want. They're constantly - really, they're always constantly thinking the war's going to end. They keep thinking, any minute now, any moment now, the war's going to stop. We'll have won, and we'll be able to deal with this in this way. And it never does end when they think it's going to end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, the development of this notion of a Final Solution from being the evacuation of Jews to the extermination of Jews you sort of describe as a process of increasing radicalization. Now...\\n\\nDAVIES: What does this mean?\\n\\nREES: So I think one of the best examples of this cumulative radicalization, of the Nazis responding brutally to crises that they themselves have created, occurs in the Lodz ghetto, where what happens is that the Jews have been imprisoned. They've been forced to give up their money to buy food. They've run out of money, so they begin to starve. So then Nazi functionaries face a choice. Some say, let them all starve. Others say, no, no. We need to get something from these people, exploit them. That view prevails. They put them to work in horrible conditions, of course, and they pay them a tiny pittance. But those who are working can actually feed themselves a bit. Other people - the old people, children - are suffering terribly and still starving.\\n\\nAnd actually, one Nazi functionary looks at this situation they themselves have created and can - and writes a note saying, wouldn't it be more humane to kill these people rather than let them starve? So that's an example of how they end up in this position that they themselves have created, where they almost - where someone has the obscenity to write that it's more humane to kill somebody than to leave them to starve.\\n\\nDAVIES: So it's done with this utterly immoral idea of herding people into ghettos with the idea you will transport them out. When you can't transport them out...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...They begin to starve. And one thing leads to another, and then you've come to this utterly horrific conclusion that...\\n\\nREES: Yes. And so what...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...You have to kill people - hundreds of thousands.\\n\\nREES: And also you see - exactly. And what's going on in the minds of a lot of these Nazis - unbelievably, we might think today, rightly - is a sense of annoyance and indignation as - that the Jews have brought this on themselves because the war is still going on, and they can't be expelled.\\n\\nSo I've heard Nazis say - and seen it - that they say, oh, well, of course Churchill is controlled by the Jews. That's why they'd - the British don't do the logical, sensible thing in 1940 and make peace with us.\\n\\nwe're still trapped in this war, and we're in the war as a result of what the Jews are doing. And if the war had gone - if the war had ended, we'd been able to expel the Jews somewhere - where incidentally they would probably have had some form of genocidal horror awaiting them anyway - but they would have been expelled somewhere, and now we can't expel them. What are we supposed to do with them?\\n\\nAnd so this is the kind of mentality that you hear and you see it absolutely plainly now, I think, as a result of a lot of new research around Pearl Harbor, that there are killings going on before Pearl Harbor, notably in Eastern Europe and behind the lines in the war against the Soviet Union. But there's nothing - there is no major death camping operation. But what happens is, as soon as Pearl Harbor happens, you see Hitler's rhetoric change. And he starts talking about, right now it's a world war, and you remember my prophecy of 1939, in which he stated if the Jews succeed in causing a world war, the result will be their annihilation.\\n\\nHe sees this as a fulfillment of a prophecy. He said, if the Jews get involved and cause a world war - America coming into the war is de facto a world war. They simultaneously think the Jews are not just behind Stalin and - but they're behind Roosevelt as well. It's pathological, this stuff. They absolutely believed that I think. And so as a result of that, they absolutely push forward with a massive expansion in the killing around that time, immediately after Pearl Harbor.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to the interview I recorded in 2005 with journalist Laurence Rees, when his book \\\"Auschwitz: A New History\\\" was published.\\n\\nWhen the Nazis first began executing Jews in large numbers, they did it, really, with firing squads. What was the impact of that kind of close-quarter execution on the Germans who carried it out?\\n\\nREES: The impact for quite a substantial proportion of them was terrible. They were emotionally made distraught by this. They're having to shoot women and children at very close range. And this - thus, I believe, begins this journey to the gas chambers that we know of, the infamous gas chambers. And it's because, we see, when Himmler visits Minsk in August 1941, he's told of the emotional problems that the killing in this way, the shooting killings are doing to his men. And he puts in training, as a result, a whole series of experiments to devise a way of killing that is not so emotionally disturbing to his men.\\n\\nI'd always thought that the reason that the gas chambers were devised was primarily to kill people in large numbers. Well, it wasn't just that at all; it was actually so that there was a less emotionally stressful way that the killers could commit murder.\\n\\nDAVIES: They began initially by putting people into a - I guess, in a cabin of some kind and piping exhaust fumes into it.\\n\\nREES: That's right. Well, what happens now again - and we can see this as an example of both cumulative radicalism and competition within the Nazi state - is various people at various different locations come up with different initiatives. What happens is there's an initiative which is the gas van, which is a van where you connect the exhaust back into a compartment hermetically sealed in the rear, where people are gassed. There's the building of the - camp Belzec, which is the first stationary gas chambers, again, using large engines with carbon gases going in to gas them.\\n\\nAnd then at the same time, in September 1941, you find a totally different initiative beginning at Auschwitz, which is the only camp where this initiative begins, which is the use of Zyklon B. Zyklon B is a powerful insecticide using - used for disinfecting rooms. And it was already in Auschwitz, and they used it for delousing prisoners' clothes and rooms because they had a terrible problem with lice because of the inhumane conditions, not least, that prisoners were kept in.\\n\\nAnd one of the functionaries there thinks to himself, well, it's got printed on the Zyklon B cans - dangerous to life; don't go in the room while this is being let off. And he goes, well, actually, of course, if you want to kill people, they should be in the room. So he starts experimenting, not on Jews but on the sick and on Soviet prisoners of war at Auschwitz. And he starts with Zyklon B. The experiments go wrong to start with. They alter doses. They do experiments. And eventually, they evolve a different method of killing to the ones used in the death camps of Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec.\\n\\nDAVIES: Now, as you noted, Auschwitz was not originally conceived of as a death camp, but as a labor camp, which meant that it was large and had lots and lots of barracks. And you note that when the killings of Jews really accelerated in 1942 that this was done not so much at Auschwitz, but at three other camps - at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. And...\\n\\nDAVIES: They were specifically set up as death camps. And you made the point that when visitors go to those sites, they are always shocked at how small they are even though...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...These three camps alone accounted for 1.7 million deaths. Why were these deaths camps so small? How did they function?\\n\\nREES: Because they had no other function than killing. Auschwitz is unique in the history of the Nazi states, unique in the history of the world. It's not just the site of the largest mass murder the world's ever seen as a physical site. It's also unique in the Nazi state in that it's the only camp that combines two functions. It's both a concentration camp and a death camp, and those functions vary at different times in its history.\\n\\nWhat's happening at places like Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor is they are set up in 1942 - all of them open in 1942. They are set up purely to murder Jews. And if you plan on just - just, I say, just - murdering people, one of the shocking things is you need no real space at all. These places are a few hundred yards square - nothing left of them now because the Nazis themselves destroyed these camps in late 1943. They knew that they wanted to keep this their secret. And they were essentially places where trains would arrive, and the Jews would be taken off. And 99 - more than 99% of these people would be dead, probably, within two hours. So there was no stay of any kind, really, at all.\\n\\nA camp like Treblinka, which was capable of killing 300,000 people in little more - in around less than two months in the summer of 1942 - 300,000 people in that one small space - it was run by around 20 Germans and about 100 Ukrainian guards. And these Ukrainians had been mostly selected from prison camps. They had been people fighting on the Russian side who, in the horror of the prison camps that the Germans set up for these Russians where millions died, were offered this chance of saving themselves, to go and work on the German side.\\n\\nAnd then there was the third category of people working in these camps who were, tragically, Jews themselves. The Nazis selected, very occasionally, from incoming transports a number of fit Jewish people and forced them, on pain of their own immediate murder, to participate in the process by cutting people's hair, by showing the way to the gas chamber, by cleaning the gas chambers, by burning the bodies and so on. And the torment that these people went through is scarcely imaginable.\\n\\nDAVIES: So the actual horrific task of murder, of cleaning the bodies, of cleaning out the chambers after the killing has occurred is, by and large, not done by Germans.\\n\\nREES: Never done by Germans, really. No.\\n\\nDAVIES: Yeah. And that was true at Auschwitz as well.\\n\\nREES: So they end up at the huge, industrial-style killing factories of Auschwitz-Birkenau. You have a crematorium gas chamber complex that's capable, in the summer of 1941, of killing 10,000 people in one day - 10,000 people in one day. And it's run by between 2 to 4 Germans and around about 100 Jews. Now, the Nazis save the absolute moment of murder to themselves. They're the ones who drop the canisters of Zyklon B actually into the gas chamber. But pretty much all the other tasks involved in making this operate are run by Jewish Sonderkommando, who we know both from interviewing some - the few people who survived this and also from documents that Jewish Sonderkommando wrote and hid in the foundations of the building often at the time. The torment these people went through was practically indescribable.\\n\\nDAVIES: I was struck by your description of the arrival buildings at the death camps, that they often were fairly pleasant-looking, I mean, with flower plantings and the kind - I guess designed to reinsure the incoming inmates...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...That their fate was not what it was going to be.\\n\\nREES: Again, this is all part of the cynicism, but it's also part of the learning curve that the Nazis go on because what happens at Treblinka, which was the most deadly, if you like, of all of these death camps outside of Auschwitz - they were killing so many people that the system broke down - summer of 1942 - that the system broke down. There were bodies everywhere. There was just mayhem, people being shot. It was chaos.\\n\\nSo they actually had to shut it down and reorganize it. And the new commander of Treblinka, what he managed to do as he pushed it forward was come up with all of these devices like the fake railway station, fake timetables, lovely flowers - same thing happened at Sobibor. One of the most extraordinary individuals I've ever met, Toivi Blatt, who survived Sobibor, said, actually, when he got off there, he'd been expecting some horrible place. He said, it was always beautiful. And as you say, it's all designed so that when, say, Jews coming from Holland arrive, they're told, you are at a transit station, hygiene stop while - we just need to take a shower, have your hair cut and we're going to move on east. And it's deliberately designed to do that.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more from him after a break, and we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. Monday, January 27 is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, based on more than 100 interviews with survivors and Nazi perpetrators. It's called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nDAVIES: You note that Auschwitz became, really, a death camp at a point when the Nazi death machine had become very well-developed, and Nazi initiative and ingenuity had addressed some of the technical difficulties of mass murder and had worked out solutions. Tell us a bit about those arriving Jews who were selected for immediate death. What exactly faced them, and who did the work?\\n\\nREES: Well, they would be taken from the - by the time - in 1944, by the time this became the most sophisticated procedure, they'd be taken straight from the arrival ramp, which was the area they arrived at, directly inside Birkenau. The railway line ran into the camp. They'd be taken, really, a few hundred yards round to one of four combination gas chamber-crematoriums.\\n\\nThey would then be taken down in two - cases of two of them, they'd be taken on - all on ground level. The other two - one had basement, undressing rooms and gas chambers. They'd be taken down or into a room where they'd be told to undress because they were going to have to have a shower as part of the camp's admittance procedure. And they would then be crammed into an airtight room - the door shut, locked behind them.\\n\\nAnd then either from above, in the case of the basement gas chambers or through the windows of the ones all on the ground floor, canisters of Zyklon B would be thrown in. And it would normally - it would take - dependent on how many people were in these gas chambers, dependent on the weather because Zyklon B was more effective the warmer the air was - it would take 15, 20 minutes for these people to die, I think, a horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible death of suffocation and poisoning.\\n\\nThe gas chambers would then be opened. The Sonderkommando, Jewish - other Jewish prisoners with gas masks, would have to go in, would take out the bodies, would - in the case of the adults - go through them and take out the gold teeth, would shave the hair of the women. The bodies would then be pushed into lifts taken up to the first - to the ground level or the basement gas chambers, where the bodies would be burned. And then their ashes would be collected and either thrown in the immediate area or taken down to the nearby river, Vistula. So that was the horror of the process that they devised in the end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Were many of the SS officials who conducted the murder at Auschwitz held accountable for their actions?\\n\\nREES: Well, I think this is one of the great scandals of this story, a story rich in scandal at every level. But this is one of the greater scandals, which is that less than - well, maybe, 12%, 10% of SS people who worked at Auschwitz were ever prosecuted. Around 90% of the SS who worked at Auschwitz during the war escaped all forms of prosecution. And myself, I think that's a scandal.\\n\\nDAVIES: Why was that?\\n\\nREES: One of the reasons that so few people were prosecuted was that by the 1960s, the German prosecutors had taken the view that unless a member of the SS was absolutely directly involved in the killing or had been directly involved in acts of brutality - physical brutality - then they could get off scot-free. And of course, it meant that the way that the gas chambers had been devised, which was that so few Germans were needed for their actual physical operation, it meant that the vast majority of SS at the camp could say, oh, I wasn't really directly involved in the killing at all.\\n\\nNow, myself, I think that's a calamity. That's terrible because, of course, if you're working in the currency units counting out money, if you're working in the SS transport division, if you're a guard at the camp, you are directly involved in the operation of the camp that results - that's an extermination center. So I certainly disagree with - you know, for all the good it's going to do anybody that I disagree, but I certainly disagree that they took that view.\\n\\nDAVIES: In this book, you compare the crimes of the Holocaust to other mass exterminations in history - going as far back as Genghis Khan's genocide in Persia - and conclude that this represents the lowest act in human history and should not be allowed to recede into distant memory as some of these other mass killings have. What's different about this extermination?\\n\\nREES: I think that if you're looking at how you should think about events in the past - or even events in the present, actually - what you've got to do is look at the overall circumstances in which these things happen. You know, it's not much good thinking, well, oh, the Vikings were terrible. Well, the Vikings operated in a system of values at the time that was - they were, by all accounts from latest research on Vikings, for example, scarcely better or worse than any other 10th century marauding hordes. I mean, it's a ludicrous - it seems to me a ludicrous way to go to start blaming Vikings for being Vikings.\\n\\nSomething different is going on here. What's happening is that you are taking a cultured nation at the heart of Europe in the 20th century, long after the Enlightenment, that has adopted absolute civilized cultural values in the wake of the end of the first world war. It is a thriving, although troubled, democracy. Its take - it's got rid of all legislation against Jews. It's liberal in that regard. All of these things are going on. It's got a great written culture. It's got a great musical culture. It's got a great artistic culture. It's the place you would think would be the most civilized almost to be. And yet that very place, within a matter of years, turns into this.\\n\\nSo you've got a journey that they go on that's unlike - and it's not like the journey the Vikings go on or Genghis Khan or the plains goes on. This is not like that. This is a different journey. This is a journey from one pole - one extreme, if you like, to the other extreme. And in the process, they use 20th-century technology that they warp and adapt to this very service of mass killing. And unlike Stalin, who even at his worst, when he was deporting entire nations - the Kalmyk nations, the Crimean Tatars and so on. He's deporting whole nations to Siberia. Even Stalin isn't trying to put forward measures to eliminate them in their entirety. So something different, I think, is going on here.\\n\\nDAVIES: So many students of Nazism and the Holocaust have tried to in some way answer the question, how could this happen? You've interviewed a hundred or so survivors and war criminals from Auschwitz. Do you feel you have some new insights into that question?\\n\\nREES: I think what surprised me about this - because I never intended this career (laughter). Like, this kind of happened to me, you know, that I've been - written so much on this and made so many programs on this. And one of the reasons it's happened is because I keep thinking I'm getting close to being able to answer that properly. And as I - as I keep getting towards it, it keeps going away from me a bit more. So I think I'm a long way down the road, I hope, to being able to get to there. But I'm not there yet. Maybe it's absolutely impossible to get there.\\n\\nBut one thing I took from this was a big fear I've now got about people of absolute faith. I always thought faith of itself was - could only be a positive thing. Everyone talks about the importance of having faith. Well, these guys had faith, absolute faith. And there's one really desperately upsetting - all desperately upsetting. But ideologically, there's one desperately particularly upsetting moment where - in the book where I talk about how Himmler and Hoss most admired, as prisoners, Jehovah's Witnesses. They pointed to them and said, see that faith? That's the kind of faith we need in our fuhrer - absolute, unshakable faith.\\n\\nNow, of course, no one is equating what the Nazis did with Jehovah's Witnesses, who operate a whole creed of peace and love and so on. Absolutely. But the very notion of absolute faith is at the core of this. And so I'm beginning to start to have questions about people who - or communities that are absolutely certain about things.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, Laurence Rees, thanks so much for speaking with us.\\n\\nREES: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" After a break, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: Today we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Next, we'll hear Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016 at the age of 87. Wiesel was born in what was then Romania and was 15 when he and his family were sent from Hungary to Auschwitz in 1944. He was later moved to another camp, Buchenwald, from which he was liberated in 1945. Among his family, only two of his sisters survived the war.\\n\\nWiesel became one of the first survivors to devote his life to bearing witness to the Holocaust. His memoir, \\\"Night,\\\" was published in English in 1960, and he spent the rest of his life speaking about social injustice. Terry spoke with him in 1988 when his novel \\\"Twilight\\\" was published.\\n\\nTERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Why have you made it your life work to bear witness?\\n\\nELIE WIESEL: What else could one do, having gone through certain events? I believe a human being, if he or she wants to remain human, then he or she must do something with what we have seen, endured, witnessed. Not to live through an experience, but the experience is there - it's bad, but not to communicate it is worse.\\n\\nGROSS: You know, I think that it's almost a human instinct to let time dim memories of horror and tragedy. Have you fought that in a way? Have you tried to keep those memories alive so that you can continue to communicate about them?\\n\\nWIESEL: Naturally. I mean, naturally, the human being wants to forget pain. In this case, although, for most of those who went through the experience during the war, they want to remember more and more and more. They go deep into their own consciousness, into their own memory, trying to find more events, more faces, more eyes, more words, more sighs, more tears, more agonies. It's never enough because we feel that we have to tell the story, and no one can tell the story fully.\\n\\nGROSS: You once described Auschwitz as the defeat of the intellect that wants to find a meaning, with a capital M, in history. Do you feel that, nevertheless, you've been really spending your life trying to find some meaning of the Holocaust, some larger meaning you could tell us about man or about God?\\n\\nWIESEL: I'll tell you, all the questions I had remain open. I really don't believe that I found any answer to any one of the questions I had. I don't know the meaning. I don't know why it happened. I don't know how it happened. I still don't know anything, really. I'm trying to tell a story, and even the story cannot be told. And therefore, it cannot be communicated, and therefore, people - and deep down, I know - won't receive the testimony that we are giving. We are a very special kind of writers, those who write about that event. And I write very little about it, really. But I know that people cannot understand.\\n\\nGROSS: I think when you were in the camps, you saw some religious people stop praying and saw people who had not been observant turn to God. You had been very observant and very immersed in the religious texts when you were young, before you were deported to the concentration camps. How did your experiences and your survival in the camps change your own experience of religion?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, the change - to the extent that it occurred - did not occur there. It's afterwards that the problems became urgent. Inside that universe, we continued praying. We continued believing. We continued affirming. We needed that link with our past. It's only after the war that I began asking questions, and I began articulating a certain protest. And that protest is still with me. I am still angry at all the forces in history that provoked such a catastrophe. That doesn't mean that my faith left me or that I left fate. I try to develop a certain protest within fate.\\n\\nGROSS: Have you gone back to the religious texts that you were reading when you were young?\\n\\nWIESEL: I never stopped reading or studying. Even inside that universe, I studied. I had a teacher there with name I never knew and whose face I hardly saw. But he was a teacher, the head of a Talmudic school in Galicia. And we work together, and we studied together. I know. It's incredible.\\n\\nGROSS: This is in the camps.\\n\\nWIESEL: Inside - in Auschwitz. So we studied. They kept on studying from morning to evening. And after the war, the first thing I wanted was a book, was a Talmudic treatise. I never stopped studying. That probably saved me.\\n\\nGROSS: In your first novel, \\\"Night...\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: \\\"Night\\\" was not a novel. It was a memoir.\\n\\nGROSS: I don't know why I think of it as a novel.\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Every word...\\n\\nGROSS: I think of think of it as a very autobiographical novel, but...\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah. Well, I - then I guess I was going to ask you about your religious teacher who narrowly escaped from being murdered with hundreds or thousands of other Jews in the forest by the SS. And he somehow managed to escape and come back to your village to warn people about what was happening, and no one would listen.\\n\\nWIESEL: We didn't listen because he was a simple man. He was a beetle. Had he been an important person, I think some people would have listened. What is so extraordinary is when we remember today the silence, the indifference of so many people who were not inside the tragedy but on the other side, just imagine if we had heard on the radio Ben-Gurion from Israel or Roosevelt or Churchill telling Hungarian Jews don't go because they are killing. They're massacring. I think they would have believed them. But why should one believe a beetle, a man who came back from the other side and was telling such atrocious stories?\\n\\nGROSS: We're getting back to the question of madness. I think a lot of people in your village just assumed he'd lost his mind and was making up - you know, was having visions or something, that this couldn't possibly have happened.\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, absolutely. I myself - I was very close to him. And we spent many, many hours alone together every evening. And I would listen to him. Plus, I love to listen to stories, even to his stories, maybe especially to hear stories. But I didn't believe them.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel recorded in 1988. Wiesel died in 2016.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you do anything to mentally prepare for what was in store when your father told you that the next day the whole village was going to be deported, the whole ghetto was going to be deported?\\n\\nWIESEL: No. We didn't know. See; Hungarian Jewry was deported at such a pace. Everything came so fast. The Hungarians allowed the Germans to come in in March. The end of May, all the Jews were out already in Germany. In less than six weeks, Eichmann had managed to deport to their death more than 600,000 Jews - men, women and children. So it came very fast. And it ended very fast. We didn't have time to think.\\n\\nGROSS: You've described yourself as having been very weak and sickly when you were young. I know you think of yourself as having survived purely by chance. Did you learn things, though, to help you survive when you were in the camps?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Not at all. I was the wrong person, the wrong candidate for survival. I was always weak, as you said, and disarmed, cowardly. I would never try to do anything, which was not what I could have done or should have done. I never asked for a supplement of anything. I didn't volunteer. I was always pleased to think that I could be invisible. Not to make myself visible was my task. I don't know why I survived. I don't know how I survived. It was really by accident.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you know when you got out of the camps that you wanted to write?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, I knew that I was going to write before I entered the camps. I come from a tradition, from the Jewish tradition, we believe - which believes in words, in language, in communication. And already at the age of 12 or 13, I was writing. Of course, it wasn't good. It meant nothing, but I tried to write. I even found the manuscript. I went back to my hometown. It's not good. But I tried.\\n\\nAfterwards, I knew I would have to bear witness. Everyone who was there is a witness, and everyone who was there is a true witness. Others who are trying to speak about this subject occasionally are false witnesses. And I felt that I had to be a true witness. And therefore, I decided to wait for 10 years, not to speak about it but to use language related to these experiences until I knew that the words were true words.\\n\\nGROSS: Why 10 years? Why not five years? Why not one year? No, seriously. What made you think..\\n\\nGROSS: ...That 10 years is what you needed to really know what it was you wanted to say and what words you wanted to say it with?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, 10 is a biblical figure, I know. And the - it's a good figure, why not? I cannot tell you that I got up one morning and decided that - let's see, that five or six or seven. It entered my mind - it has to be 10. I decided 10.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you actually have an anniversary where like...\\n\\nGROSS: And that day you sat down to write.\\n\\nGROSS: And is that when you started to write \\\"Night?\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" yes. That's when I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" on April 11, 1955, which is 10 years later.\\n\\nGROSS: And looking back, do you think that this was definitely the right thing to do, to wait those 10 years? In what ways were you changed as a witness and as a writer during those 10 years?\\n\\nWIESEL: Maybe I didn't change, but the words in me changed. They grew. you know, Words have strange destiny, too. They grow, they get old, they die, they come back. Words can be turned into spears. They can be turned into prayers. It's a strange world that you are in when you deal with words.\\n\\nGROSS: In one of your essays, you wrote that after the war, you deliberately avoided all contact with Germans and that their presence sickened you physically. Did that change? And if so, what changed that?\\n\\nWIESEL: It did. But I didn't want to go back to Germany, really. I went once because I didn't want to judge people. I went once in the early '60s to do a piece for commentary. And I realized that every person I see in the street, I judge him or her asking, where was he, what did he do, how old is he, could I - could he have been there? And I didn't want that role, so I didn't go back. But I did go back last year in '86, '87.\\n\\nToday, you have a young generation of Germans. And I do not believe in collective guilt. So I have absolutely no problem with the young Germans. I even feel sorry for the young Germans because to be maybe sons or daughters of killers is different than to be sons and daughters of the victims. And I felt sorry for them. I still do.\\n\\nGROSS: The generations of survivors are getting older. The older generation of survivors is no longer with us. Are you concerned about what's going to happen after the generations of survivors pass on, like, who will be around to actually speak the memories?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, I'm profoundly concerned, naturally. In one of my novels, I try to describe that feeling of the last survivor, what it means to be the very last. And I would not want to be that last survivor. But on the other hand, we are leaving a legacy. We are bequeathing a certain message, a certain story. This tragedy is the most documented tragedy in recorded history. And therefore later on, if there will be a later on, anyone wishing to know will know where to go for knowledge.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988.

I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Monday, January 27, is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Today we're going to listen to two interviews. In a bit, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016. But first, we'll listen to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, the site of history's largest mass murder, as well as insights into Hitler's campaign of genocide against the Jews of Europe.\\n\\nRees' book is based on more than a hundred interviews with Auschwitz survivors and Nazi perpetrators, many of whom spoke on the record for the first time. He believes his search for the truth was aided by the fact that surviving Nazis had reached an age where candor no longer jeopardized careers and by the fall of communism, which opened up a wealth of new archival material. His book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nLAURENCE REES: Thank you very much.\\n\\nDAVIES: You note early in this book that you were one of relatively few people who've been able to interview quite a number of war criminals from three of the great totalitarian powers of the 20th century - that is, Stalinist Russia, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. And you say in this book that having done so, you can confirm that Nazi war criminals that you met were different from the other two.\\n\\nDAVIES: How were they different?\\n\\nREES: They're different in a kind of paradoxical way because when I grew up at school and first heard about the Nazis and - the whole line that was taken then in the '70s was that Nazi war criminals would give us the standard defense. Oh, I was only - I was acting under orders. I was acting under orders. And so that was kind of what you imagine, when you meet people like this, they're going to say. Well, paradoxically, that was the kind of response I got from Stalin's secret policemen, from members of the Imperial Army who committed terrible crimes in China and in the Pacific War. That was what they were saying. I didn't tend to get that from Nazi war criminals. The frightening thing to me - particularly frightening - was that most of the Nazi war criminals I've met actually, when you push them, say, well - and you say, well, why were you doing this - don't say, I was acting on your orders. Say, well, at the time, I thought what I was doing was right.\\n\\nDAVIES: And what do you attribute that to? I mean, they seemed to be true believers in the cause.\\n\\nREES: I think it's a variety of things that, in the end, for me, mean that Nazism is more horrible but more interesting as a phenomenon. I think it's to do with the fact that, certainly, if you were a secret policeman in Stalin's Russia, I think for the most part, the terror was so ubiquitous that no one was safe from the knock at the door. No one could really understand exactly why individuals were sometimes being targeted. Stalin famously had one of his own Politburo, Molotov's wife, tortured. I've talked to people who were at meetings where they stood up and were denouncing other people as enemies of the state because they were worried they'd be denounced. There didn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to some of this. So this means that the only way of making sense of it, really, for a lot of these people doing the bad things was to say, well, you know, I was doing it because I'm ordered to do it.\\n\\nSimilarly, in Imperial Japan, the level of training - the brutality of the training of Japanese soldiers, I think, is without parallel in the modern world, what these people were put through in training - bullying, the vicious beatings and so on, the indoctrination as well. But it was such that if you didn't - you know, you obeyed, and you obeyed blindly, I think, in a number of cases.\\n\\nWhat's going on in Germany is rather different. What's going on in Germany is that - I think to some extent thanks to the work of Goebbels, who - again, a horrible, nasty person, but the genius of propaganda of the 20th century. Thanks to the work of Goebbels, but also thanks to the fact that there was a genuine feeling of injustice in Germany after the end of the First World War. There was a feeling put about that Jews were to blame. There was a feeling of fear of communism, that Jews were somehow falsely attributed in their totality to communism. Simultaneously, Jews were thought to be running Roosevelt in American politics, anti-German and so on. So there were a whole series of what they took to be, at the time, pragmatic, positive reasons to do what they were doing, and that's one of the frightening things about it.\\n\\nDAVIES: When the Nazis spoke of achieving the Final Solution to the Jewish problem in the early years of the war, is it clear they meant extermination of the Jews?\\n\\nREES: No, they didn't mean extermination, I don't believe. It's clear that the words Final Solution change in meaning, I believe, during 1941. When Heydrich is charged by Goring with organizing the Final Solution to the Jewish problem, initially, the order explicitly states evacuation. And that was the overt policy, certainly, since 1938 and the Anschluss with Austria. When the German troops go into Austria, they, under Eichmann of the SS of - you know, later absolutely infamous for being one of the organizers of the murders in the Final Solution - he organizes a system of expropriation, of robbing, of treating violently the Jews of Vienna, robbing them and then those who can almost pay to go, expelling them.\\n\\nI think that what's clear is that Hitler always hated the Jews. He always loathed the Jews. He always wanted rid of the Jews in one way or another. The form that that wanting rid of would take varied at different points. The Final Solution, therefore, varied, I think, at different points. And certainly, at the beginning of the war, the Final Solution, I think, to the Jewish problem is one as they see it. I mean, horrible to use this language. It's not a problem. It's the problem of their mentality. But as they described it, the Jewish problem - the way to, quote, \\\"solve,\\\" unquote, this was by evacuation.\\n\\nDAVIES: It's remarkable that you find places where people talk about the notion of mass killings as being uncivilized and un-German.\\n\\nREES: Yes, that's right. Both Heydrich and Himmler say that in the - 1940. And so we know, I think, beyond reasonable doubt that the Final Solution does not mean extermination because in - actually on paper, Himmler and Heydrich are talking about extermination as being uncivilized when later on openly, at his speech at Poznan in 1943, Himmler is talking about physical extermination. Something changes.\\n\\nAnd again, we know that from the documents that - and from eyewitness testimony that in the summer of 1940, they had this - what it seems now at this distance - utterly outlandish, insane plan to transport Jews to Madagascar, the island of Madagascar of Africa. What they anticipated, the Nazis, was that the war was going to end in 1940. Britain would make peace, and they had - would have the French colonies at their disposal, including Madagascar. And the Jews would be able in French ships probably to be shipped there, which is why they were herded into ghettos. Ghettos were only ever seen as a temporary measure prior to expulsion.\\n\\nBut again, as you see time and again in this terrible history, things don't go the way the Nazis want. They're constantly - really, they're always constantly thinking the war's going to end. They keep thinking, any minute now, any moment now, the war's going to stop. We'll have won, and we'll be able to deal with this in this way. And it never does end when they think it's going to end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, the development of this notion of a Final Solution from being the evacuation of Jews to the extermination of Jews you sort of describe as a process of increasing radicalization. Now...\\n\\nDAVIES: What does this mean?\\n\\nREES: So I think one of the best examples of this cumulative radicalization, of the Nazis responding brutally to crises that they themselves have created, occurs in the Lodz ghetto, where what happens is that the Jews have been imprisoned. They've been forced to give up their money to buy food. They've run out of money, so they begin to starve. So then Nazi functionaries face a choice. Some say, let them all starve. Others say, no, no. We need to get something from these people, exploit them. That view prevails. They put them to work in horrible conditions, of course, and they pay them a tiny pittance. But those who are working can actually feed themselves a bit. Other people - the old people, children - are suffering terribly and still starving.\\n\\nAnd actually, one Nazi functionary looks at this situation they themselves have created and can - and writes a note saying, wouldn't it be more humane to kill these people rather than let them starve? So that's an example of how they end up in this position that they themselves have created, where they almost - where someone has the obscenity to write that it's more humane to kill somebody than to leave them to starve.\\n\\nDAVIES: So it's done with this utterly immoral idea of herding people into ghettos with the idea you will transport them out. When you can't transport them out...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...They begin to starve. And one thing leads to another, and then you've come to this utterly horrific conclusion that...\\n\\nREES: Yes. And so what...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...You have to kill people - hundreds of thousands.\\n\\nREES: And also you see - exactly. And what's going on in the minds of a lot of these Nazis - unbelievably, we might think today, rightly - is a sense of annoyance and indignation as - that the Jews have brought this on themselves because the war is still going on, and they can't be expelled.\\n\\nSo I've heard Nazis say - and seen it - that they say, oh, well, of course Churchill is controlled by the Jews. That's why they'd - the British don't do the logical, sensible thing in 1940 and make peace with us.\\n\\nwe're still trapped in this war, and we're in the war as a result of what the Jews are doing. And if the war had gone - if the war had ended, we'd been able to expel the Jews somewhere - where incidentally they would probably have had some form of genocidal horror awaiting them anyway - but they would have been expelled somewhere, and now we can't expel them. What are we supposed to do with them?\\n\\nAnd so this is the kind of mentality that you hear and you see it absolutely plainly now, I think, as a result of a lot of new research around Pearl Harbor, that there are killings going on before Pearl Harbor, notably in Eastern Europe and behind the lines in the war against the Soviet Union. But there's nothing - there is no major death camping operation. But what happens is, as soon as Pearl Harbor happens, you see Hitler's rhetoric change. And he starts talking about, right now it's a world war, and you remember my prophecy of 1939, in which he stated if the Jews succeed in causing a world war, the result will be their annihilation.\\n\\nHe sees this as a fulfillment of a prophecy. He said, if the Jews get involved and cause a world war - America coming into the war is de facto a world war. They simultaneously think the Jews are not just behind Stalin and - but they're behind Roosevelt as well. It's pathological, this stuff. They absolutely believed that I think. And so as a result of that, they absolutely push forward with a massive expansion in the killing around that time, immediately after Pearl Harbor.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to the interview I recorded in 2005 with journalist Laurence Rees, when his book \\\"Auschwitz: A New History\\\" was published.\\n\\nWhen the Nazis first began executing Jews in large numbers, they did it, really, with firing squads. What was the impact of that kind of close-quarter execution on the Germans who carried it out?\\n\\nREES: The impact for quite a substantial proportion of them was terrible. They were emotionally made distraught by this. They're having to shoot women and children at very close range. And this - thus, I believe, begins this journey to the gas chambers that we know of, the infamous gas chambers. And it's because, we see, when Himmler visits Minsk in August 1941, he's told of the emotional problems that the killing in this way, the shooting killings are doing to his men. And he puts in training, as a result, a whole series of experiments to devise a way of killing that is not so emotionally disturbing to his men.\\n\\nI'd always thought that the reason that the gas chambers were devised was primarily to kill people in large numbers. Well, it wasn't just that at all; it was actually so that there was a less emotionally stressful way that the killers could commit murder.\\n\\nDAVIES: They began initially by putting people into a - I guess, in a cabin of some kind and piping exhaust fumes into it.\\n\\nREES: That's right. Well, what happens now again - and we can see this as an example of both cumulative radicalism and competition within the Nazi state - is various people at various different locations come up with different initiatives. What happens is there's an initiative which is the gas van, which is a van where you connect the exhaust back into a compartment hermetically sealed in the rear, where people are gassed. There's the building of the - camp Belzec, which is the first stationary gas chambers, again, using large engines with carbon gases going in to gas them.\\n\\nAnd then at the same time, in September 1941, you find a totally different initiative beginning at Auschwitz, which is the only camp where this initiative begins, which is the use of Zyklon B. Zyklon B is a powerful insecticide using - used for disinfecting rooms. And it was already in Auschwitz, and they used it for delousing prisoners' clothes and rooms because they had a terrible problem with lice because of the inhumane conditions, not least, that prisoners were kept in.\\n\\nAnd one of the functionaries there thinks to himself, well, it's got printed on the Zyklon B cans - dangerous to life; don't go in the room while this is being let off. And he goes, well, actually, of course, if you want to kill people, they should be in the room. So he starts experimenting, not on Jews but on the sick and on Soviet prisoners of war at Auschwitz. And he starts with Zyklon B. The experiments go wrong to start with. They alter doses. They do experiments. And eventually, they evolve a different method of killing to the ones used in the death camps of Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec.\\n\\nDAVIES: Now, as you noted, Auschwitz was not originally conceived of as a death camp, but as a labor camp, which meant that it was large and had lots and lots of barracks. And you note that when the killings of Jews really accelerated in 1942 that this was done not so much at Auschwitz, but at three other camps - at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. And...\\n\\nDAVIES: They were specifically set up as death camps. And you made the point that when visitors go to those sites, they are always shocked at how small they are even though...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...These three camps alone accounted for 1.7 million deaths. Why were these deaths camps so small? How did they function?\\n\\nREES: Because they had no other function than killing. Auschwitz is unique in the history of the Nazi states, unique in the history of the world. It's not just the site of the largest mass murder the world's ever seen as a physical site. It's also unique in the Nazi state in that it's the only camp that combines two functions. It's both a concentration camp and a death camp, and those functions vary at different times in its history.\\n\\nWhat's happening at places like Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor is they are set up in 1942 - all of them open in 1942. They are set up purely to murder Jews. And if you plan on just - just, I say, just - murdering people, one of the shocking things is you need no real space at all. These places are a few hundred yards square - nothing left of them now because the Nazis themselves destroyed these camps in late 1943. They knew that they wanted to keep this their secret. And they were essentially places where trains would arrive, and the Jews would be taken off. And 99 - more than 99% of these people would be dead, probably, within two hours. So there was no stay of any kind, really, at all.\\n\\nA camp like Treblinka, which was capable of killing 300,000 people in little more - in around less than two months in the summer of 1942 - 300,000 people in that one small space - it was run by around 20 Germans and about 100 Ukrainian guards. And these Ukrainians had been mostly selected from prison camps. They had been people fighting on the Russian side who, in the horror of the prison camps that the Germans set up for these Russians where millions died, were offered this chance of saving themselves, to go and work on the German side.\\n\\nAnd then there was the third category of people working in these camps who were, tragically, Jews themselves. The Nazis selected, very occasionally, from incoming transports a number of fit Jewish people and forced them, on pain of their own immediate murder, to participate in the process by cutting people's hair, by showing the way to the gas chamber, by cleaning the gas chambers, by burning the bodies and so on. And the torment that these people went through is scarcely imaginable.\\n\\nDAVIES: So the actual horrific task of murder, of cleaning the bodies, of cleaning out the chambers after the killing has occurred is, by and large, not done by Germans.\\n\\nREES: Never done by Germans, really. No.\\n\\nDAVIES: Yeah. And that was true at Auschwitz as well.\\n\\nREES: So they end up at the huge, industrial-style killing factories of Auschwitz-Birkenau. You have a crematorium gas chamber complex that's capable, in the summer of 1941, of killing 10,000 people in one day - 10,000 people in one day. And it's run by between 2 to 4 Germans and around about 100 Jews. Now, the Nazis save the absolute moment of murder to themselves. They're the ones who drop the canisters of Zyklon B actually into the gas chamber. But pretty much all the other tasks involved in making this operate are run by Jewish Sonderkommando, who we know both from interviewing some - the few people who survived this and also from documents that Jewish Sonderkommando wrote and hid in the foundations of the building often at the time. The torment these people went through was practically indescribable.\\n\\nDAVIES: I was struck by your description of the arrival buildings at the death camps, that they often were fairly pleasant-looking, I mean, with flower plantings and the kind - I guess designed to reinsure the incoming inmates...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...That their fate was not what it was going to be.\\n\\nREES: Again, this is all part of the cynicism, but it's also part of the learning curve that the Nazis go on because what happens at Treblinka, which was the most deadly, if you like, of all of these death camps outside of Auschwitz - they were killing so many people that the system broke down - summer of 1942 - that the system broke down. There were bodies everywhere. There was just mayhem, people being shot. It was chaos.\\n\\nSo they actually had to shut it down and reorganize it. And the new commander of Treblinka, what he managed to do as he pushed it forward was come up with all of these devices like the fake railway station, fake timetables, lovely flowers - same thing happened at Sobibor. One of the most extraordinary individuals I've ever met, Toivi Blatt, who survived Sobibor, said, actually, when he got off there, he'd been expecting some horrible place. He said, it was always beautiful. And as you say, it's all designed so that when, say, Jews coming from Holland arrive, they're told, you are at a transit station, hygiene stop while - we just need to take a shower, have your hair cut and we're going to move on east. And it's deliberately designed to do that.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more from him after a break, and we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. Monday, January 27 is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, based on more than 100 interviews with survivors and Nazi perpetrators. It's called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nDAVIES: You note that Auschwitz became, really, a death camp at a point when the Nazi death machine had become very well-developed, and Nazi initiative and ingenuity had addressed some of the technical difficulties of mass murder and had worked out solutions. Tell us a bit about those arriving Jews who were selected for immediate death. What exactly faced them, and who did the work?\\n\\nREES: Well, they would be taken from the - by the time - in 1944, by the time this became the most sophisticated procedure, they'd be taken straight from the arrival ramp, which was the area they arrived at, directly inside Birkenau. The railway line ran into the camp. They'd be taken, really, a few hundred yards round to one of four combination gas chamber-crematoriums.\\n\\nThey would then be taken down in two - cases of two of them, they'd be taken on - all on ground level. The other two - one had basement, undressing rooms and gas chambers. They'd be taken down or into a room where they'd be told to undress because they were going to have to have a shower as part of the camp's admittance procedure. And they would then be crammed into an airtight room - the door shut, locked behind them.\\n\\nAnd then either from above, in the case of the basement gas chambers or through the windows of the ones all on the ground floor, canisters of Zyklon B would be thrown in. And it would normally - it would take - dependent on how many people were in these gas chambers, dependent on the weather because Zyklon B was more effective the warmer the air was - it would take 15, 20 minutes for these people to die, I think, a horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible death of suffocation and poisoning.\\n\\nThe gas chambers would then be opened. The Sonderkommando, Jewish - other Jewish prisoners with gas masks, would have to go in, would take out the bodies, would - in the case of the adults - go through them and take out the gold teeth, would shave the hair of the women. The bodies would then be pushed into lifts taken up to the first - to the ground level or the basement gas chambers, where the bodies would be burned. And then their ashes would be collected and either thrown in the immediate area or taken down to the nearby river, Vistula. So that was the horror of the process that they devised in the end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Were many of the SS officials who conducted the murder at Auschwitz held accountable for their actions?\\n\\nREES: Well, I think this is one of the great scandals of this story, a story rich in scandal at every level. But this is one of the greater scandals, which is that less than - well, maybe, 12%, 10% of SS people who worked at Auschwitz were ever prosecuted. Around 90% of the SS who worked at Auschwitz during the war escaped all forms of prosecution. And myself, I think that's a scandal.\\n\\nDAVIES: Why was that?\\n\\nREES: One of the reasons that so few people were prosecuted was that by the 1960s, the German prosecutors had taken the view that unless a member of the SS was absolutely directly involved in the killing or had been directly involved in acts of brutality - physical brutality - then they could get off scot-free. And of course, it meant that the way that the gas chambers had been devised, which was that so few Germans were needed for their actual physical operation, it meant that the vast majority of SS at the camp could say, oh, I wasn't really directly involved in the killing at all.\\n\\nNow, myself, I think that's a calamity. That's terrible because, of course, if you're working in the currency units counting out money, if you're working in the SS transport division, if you're a guard at the camp, you are directly involved in the operation of the camp that results - that's an extermination center. So I certainly disagree with - you know, for all the good it's going to do anybody that I disagree, but I certainly disagree that they took that view.\\n\\nDAVIES: In this book, you compare the crimes of the Holocaust to other mass exterminations in history - going as far back as Genghis Khan's genocide in Persia - and conclude that this represents the lowest act in human history and should not be allowed to recede into distant memory as some of these other mass killings have. What's different about this extermination?\\n\\nREES: I think that if you're looking at how you should think about events in the past - or even events in the present, actually - what you've got to do is look at the overall circumstances in which these things happen. You know, it's not much good thinking, well, oh, the Vikings were terrible. Well, the Vikings operated in a system of values at the time that was - they were, by all accounts from latest research on Vikings, for example, scarcely better or worse than any other 10th century marauding hordes. I mean, it's a ludicrous - it seems to me a ludicrous way to go to start blaming Vikings for being Vikings.\\n\\nSomething different is going on here. What's happening is that you are taking a cultured nation at the heart of Europe in the 20th century, long after the Enlightenment, that has adopted absolute civilized cultural values in the wake of the end of the first world war. It is a thriving, although troubled, democracy. Its take - it's got rid of all legislation against Jews. It's liberal in that regard. All of these things are going on. It's got a great written culture. It's got a great musical culture. It's got a great artistic culture. It's the place you would think would be the most civilized almost to be. And yet that very place, within a matter of years, turns into this.\\n\\nSo you've got a journey that they go on that's unlike - and it's not like the journey the Vikings go on or Genghis Khan or the plains goes on. This is not like that. This is a different journey. This is a journey from one pole - one extreme, if you like, to the other extreme. And in the process, they use 20th-century technology that they warp and adapt to this very service of mass killing. And unlike Stalin, who even at his worst, when he was deporting entire nations - the Kalmyk nations, the Crimean Tatars and so on. He's deporting whole nations to Siberia. Even Stalin isn't trying to put forward measures to eliminate them in their entirety. So something different, I think, is going on here.\\n\\nDAVIES: So many students of Nazism and the Holocaust have tried to in some way answer the question, how could this happen? You've interviewed a hundred or so survivors and war criminals from Auschwitz. Do you feel you have some new insights into that question?\\n\\nREES: I think what surprised me about this - because I never intended this career (laughter). Like, this kind of happened to me, you know, that I've been - written so much on this and made so many programs on this. And one of the reasons it's happened is because I keep thinking I'm getting close to being able to answer that properly. And as I - as I keep getting towards it, it keeps going away from me a bit more. So I think I'm a long way down the road, I hope, to being able to get to there. But I'm not there yet. Maybe it's absolutely impossible to get there.\\n\\nBut one thing I took from this was a big fear I've now got about people of absolute faith. I always thought faith of itself was - could only be a positive thing. Everyone talks about the importance of having faith. Well, these guys had faith, absolute faith. And there's one really desperately upsetting - all desperately upsetting. But ideologically, there's one desperately particularly upsetting moment where - in the book where I talk about how Himmler and Hoss most admired, as prisoners, Jehovah's Witnesses. They pointed to them and said, see that faith? That's the kind of faith we need in our fuhrer - absolute, unshakable faith.\\n\\nNow, of course, no one is equating what the Nazis did with Jehovah's Witnesses, who operate a whole creed of peace and love and so on. Absolutely. But the very notion of absolute faith is at the core of this. And so I'm beginning to start to have questions about people who - or communities that are absolutely certain about things.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, Laurence Rees, thanks so much for speaking with us.\\n\\nREES: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" After a break, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: Today we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Next, we'll hear Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016 at the age of 87. Wiesel was born in what was then Romania and was 15 when he and his family were sent from Hungary to Auschwitz in 1944. He was later moved to another camp, Buchenwald, from which he was liberated in 1945. Among his family, only two of his sisters survived the war.\\n\\nWiesel became one of the first survivors to devote his life to bearing witness to the Holocaust. His memoir, \\\"Night,\\\" was published in English in 1960, and he spent the rest of his life speaking about social injustice. Terry spoke with him in 1988 when his novel \\\"Twilight\\\" was published.\\n\\nTERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Why have you made it your life work to bear witness?\\n\\nELIE WIESEL: What else could one do, having gone through certain events? I believe a human being, if he or she wants to remain human, then he or she must do something with what we have seen, endured, witnessed. Not to live through an experience, but the experience is there - it's bad, but not to communicate it is worse.\\n\\nGROSS: You know, I think that it's almost a human instinct to let time dim memories of horror and tragedy. Have you fought that in a way? Have you tried to keep those memories alive so that you can continue to communicate about them?\\n\\nWIESEL: Naturally. I mean, naturally, the human being wants to forget pain. In this case, although, for most of those who went through the experience during the war, they want to remember more and more and more. They go deep into their own consciousness, into their own memory, trying to find more events, more faces, more eyes, more words, more sighs, more tears, more agonies. It's never enough because we feel that we have to tell the story, and no one can tell the story fully.\\n\\nGROSS: You once described Auschwitz as the defeat of the intellect that wants to find a meaning, with a capital M, in history. Do you feel that, nevertheless, you've been really spending your life trying to find some meaning of the Holocaust, some larger meaning you could tell us about man or about God?\\n\\nWIESEL: I'll tell you, all the questions I had remain open. I really don't believe that I found any answer to any one of the questions I had. I don't know the meaning. I don't know why it happened. I don't know how it happened. I still don't know anything, really. I'm trying to tell a story, and even the story cannot be told. And therefore, it cannot be communicated, and therefore, people - and deep down, I know - won't receive the testimony that we are giving. We are a very special kind of writers, those who write about that event. And I write very little about it, really. But I know that people cannot understand.\\n\\nGROSS: I think when you were in the camps, you saw some religious people stop praying and saw people who had not been observant turn to God. You had been very observant and very immersed in the religious texts when you were young, before you were deported to the concentration camps. How did your experiences and your survival in the camps change your own experience of religion?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, the change - to the extent that it occurred - did not occur there. It's afterwards that the problems became urgent. Inside that universe, we continued praying. We continued believing. We continued affirming. We needed that link with our past. It's only after the war that I began asking questions, and I began articulating a certain protest. And that protest is still with me. I am still angry at all the forces in history that provoked such a catastrophe. That doesn't mean that my faith left me or that I left fate. I try to develop a certain protest within fate.\\n\\nGROSS: Have you gone back to the religious texts that you were reading when you were young?\\n\\nWIESEL: I never stopped reading or studying. Even inside that universe, I studied. I had a teacher there with name I never knew and whose face I hardly saw. But he was a teacher, the head of a Talmudic school in Galicia. And we work together, and we studied together. I know. It's incredible.\\n\\nGROSS: This is in the camps.\\n\\nWIESEL: Inside - in Auschwitz. So we studied. They kept on studying from morning to evening. And after the war, the first thing I wanted was a book, was a Talmudic treatise. I never stopped studying. That probably saved me.\\n\\nGROSS: In your first novel, \\\"Night...\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: \\\"Night\\\" was not a novel. It was a memoir.\\n\\nGROSS: I don't know why I think of it as a novel.\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Every word...\\n\\nGROSS: I think of think of it as a very autobiographical novel, but...\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah. Well, I - then I guess I was going to ask you about your religious teacher who narrowly escaped from being murdered with hundreds or thousands of other Jews in the forest by the SS. And he somehow managed to escape and come back to your village to warn people about what was happening, and no one would listen.\\n\\nWIESEL: We didn't listen because he was a simple man. He was a beetle. Had he been an important person, I think some people would have listened. What is so extraordinary is when we remember today the silence, the indifference of so many people who were not inside the tragedy but on the other side, just imagine if we had heard on the radio Ben-Gurion from Israel or Roosevelt or Churchill telling Hungarian Jews don't go because they are killing. They're massacring. I think they would have believed them. But why should one believe a beetle, a man who came back from the other side and was telling such atrocious stories?\\n\\nGROSS: We're getting back to the question of madness. I think a lot of people in your village just assumed he'd lost his mind and was making up - you know, was having visions or something, that this couldn't possibly have happened.\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, absolutely. I myself - I was very close to him. And we spent many, many hours alone together every evening. And I would listen to him. Plus, I love to listen to stories, even to his stories, maybe especially to hear stories. But I didn't believe them.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel recorded in 1988. Wiesel died in 2016.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you do anything to mentally prepare for what was in store when your father told you that the next day the whole village was going to be deported, the whole ghetto was going to be deported?\\n\\nWIESEL: No. We didn't know. See; Hungarian Jewry was deported at such a pace. Everything came so fast. The Hungarians allowed the Germans to come in in March. The end of May, all the Jews were out already in Germany. In less than six weeks, Eichmann had managed to deport to their death more than 600,000 Jews - men, women and children. So it came very fast. And it ended very fast. We didn't have time to think.\\n\\nGROSS: You've described yourself as having been very weak and sickly when you were young. I know you think of yourself as having survived purely by chance. Did you learn things, though, to help you survive when you were in the camps?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Not at all. I was the wrong person, the wrong candidate for survival. I was always weak, as you said, and disarmed, cowardly. I would never try to do anything, which was not what I could have done or should have done. I never asked for a supplement of anything. I didn't volunteer. I was always pleased to think that I could be invisible. Not to make myself visible was my task. I don't know why I survived. I don't know how I survived. It was really by accident.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you know when you got out of the camps that you wanted to write?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, I knew that I was going to write before I entered the camps. I come from a tradition, from the Jewish tradition, we believe - which believes in words, in language, in communication. And already at the age of 12 or 13, I was writing. Of course, it wasn't good. It meant nothing, but I tried to write. I even found the manuscript. I went back to my hometown. It's not good. But I tried.\\n\\nAfterwards, I knew I would have to bear witness. Everyone who was there is a witness, and everyone who was there is a true witness. Others who are trying to speak about this subject occasionally are false witnesses. And I felt that I had to be a true witness. And therefore, I decided to wait for 10 years, not to speak about it but to use language related to these experiences until I knew that the words were true words.\\n\\nGROSS: Why 10 years? Why not five years? Why not one year? No, seriously. What made you think..\\n\\nGROSS: ...That 10 years is what you needed to really know what it was you wanted to say and what words you wanted to say it with?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, 10 is a biblical figure, I know. And the - it's a good figure, why not? I cannot tell you that I got up one morning and decided that - let's see, that five or six or seven. It entered my mind - it has to be 10. I decided 10.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you actually have an anniversary where like...\\n\\nGROSS: And that day you sat down to write.\\n\\nGROSS: And is that when you started to write \\\"Night?\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" yes. That's when I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" on April 11, 1955, which is 10 years later.\\n\\nGROSS: And looking back, do you think that this was definitely the right thing to do, to wait those 10 years? In what ways were you changed as a witness and as a writer during those 10 years?\\n\\nWIESEL: Maybe I didn't change, but the words in me changed. They grew. you know, Words have strange destiny, too. They grow, they get old, they die, they come back. Words can be turned into spears. They can be turned into prayers. It's a strange world that you are in when you deal with words.\\n\\nGROSS: In one of your essays, you wrote that after the war, you deliberately avoided all contact with Germans and that their presence sickened you physically. Did that change? And if so, what changed that?\\n\\nWIESEL: It did. But I didn't want to go back to Germany, really. I went once because I didn't want to judge people. I went once in the early '60s to do a piece for commentary. And I realized that every person I see in the street, I judge him or her asking, where was he, what did he do, how old is he, could I - could he have been there? And I didn't want that role, so I didn't go back. But I did go back last year in '86, '87.\\n\\nToday, you have a young generation of Germans. And I do not believe in collective guilt. So I have absolutely no problem with the young Germans. I even feel sorry for the young Germans because to be maybe sons or daughters of killers is different than to be sons and daughters of the victims. And I felt sorry for them. I still do.\\n\\nGROSS: The generations of survivors are getting older. The older generation of survivors is no longer with us. Are you concerned about what's going to happen after the generations of survivors pass on, like, who will be around to actually speak the memories?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, I'm profoundly concerned, naturally. In one of my novels, I try to describe that feeling of the last survivor, what it means to be the very last. And I would not want to be that last survivor. But on the other hand, we are leaving a legacy. We are bequeathing a certain message, a certain story. This tragedy is the most documented tragedy in recorded history. And therefore later on, if there will be a later on, anyone wishing to know will know where to go for knowledge.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988.

I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Monday, January 27, is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Today we're going to listen to two interviews. In a bit, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016. But first, we'll listen to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, the site of history's largest mass murder, as well as insights into Hitler's campaign of genocide against the Jews of Europe.\\n\\nRees' book is based on more than a hundred interviews with Auschwitz survivors and Nazi perpetrators, many of whom spoke on the record for the first time. He believes his search for the truth was aided by the fact that surviving Nazis had reached an age where candor no longer jeopardized careers and by the fall of communism, which opened up a wealth of new archival material. His book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nLAURENCE REES: Thank you very much.\\n\\nDAVIES: You note early in this book that you were one of relatively few people who've been able to interview quite a number of war criminals from three of the great totalitarian powers of the 20th century - that is, Stalinist Russia, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. And you say in this book that having done so, you can confirm that Nazi war criminals that you met were different from the other two.\\n\\nDAVIES: How were they different?\\n\\nREES: They're different in a kind of paradoxical way because when I grew up at school and first heard about the Nazis and - the whole line that was taken then in the '70s was that Nazi war criminals would give us the standard defense. Oh, I was only - I was acting under orders. I was acting under orders. And so that was kind of what you imagine, when you meet people like this, they're going to say. Well, paradoxically, that was the kind of response I got from Stalin's secret policemen, from members of the Imperial Army who committed terrible crimes in China and in the Pacific War. That was what they were saying. I didn't tend to get that from Nazi war criminals. The frightening thing to me - particularly frightening - was that most of the Nazi war criminals I've met actually, when you push them, say, well - and you say, well, why were you doing this - don't say, I was acting on your orders. Say, well, at the time, I thought what I was doing was right.\\n\\nDAVIES: And what do you attribute that to? I mean, they seemed to be true believers in the cause.\\n\\nREES: I think it's a variety of things that, in the end, for me, mean that Nazism is more horrible but more interesting as a phenomenon. I think it's to do with the fact that, certainly, if you were a secret policeman in Stalin's Russia, I think for the most part, the terror was so ubiquitous that no one was safe from the knock at the door. No one could really understand exactly why individuals were sometimes being targeted. Stalin famously had one of his own Politburo, Molotov's wife, tortured. I've talked to people who were at meetings where they stood up and were denouncing other people as enemies of the state because they were worried they'd be denounced. There didn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to some of this. So this means that the only way of making sense of it, really, for a lot of these people doing the bad things was to say, well, you know, I was doing it because I'm ordered to do it.\\n\\nSimilarly, in Imperial Japan, the level of training - the brutality of the training of Japanese soldiers, I think, is without parallel in the modern world, what these people were put through in training - bullying, the vicious beatings and so on, the indoctrination as well. But it was such that if you didn't - you know, you obeyed, and you obeyed blindly, I think, in a number of cases.\\n\\nWhat's going on in Germany is rather different. What's going on in Germany is that - I think to some extent thanks to the work of Goebbels, who - again, a horrible, nasty person, but the genius of propaganda of the 20th century. Thanks to the work of Goebbels, but also thanks to the fact that there was a genuine feeling of injustice in Germany after the end of the First World War. There was a feeling put about that Jews were to blame. There was a feeling of fear of communism, that Jews were somehow falsely attributed in their totality to communism. Simultaneously, Jews were thought to be running Roosevelt in American politics, anti-German and so on. So there were a whole series of what they took to be, at the time, pragmatic, positive reasons to do what they were doing, and that's one of the frightening things about it.\\n\\nDAVIES: When the Nazis spoke of achieving the Final Solution to the Jewish problem in the early years of the war, is it clear they meant extermination of the Jews?\\n\\nREES: No, they didn't mean extermination, I don't believe. It's clear that the words Final Solution change in meaning, I believe, during 1941. When Heydrich is charged by Goring with organizing the Final Solution to the Jewish problem, initially, the order explicitly states evacuation. And that was the overt policy, certainly, since 1938 and the Anschluss with Austria. When the German troops go into Austria, they, under Eichmann of the SS of - you know, later absolutely infamous for being one of the organizers of the murders in the Final Solution - he organizes a system of expropriation, of robbing, of treating violently the Jews of Vienna, robbing them and then those who can almost pay to go, expelling them.\\n\\nI think that what's clear is that Hitler always hated the Jews. He always loathed the Jews. He always wanted rid of the Jews in one way or another. The form that that wanting rid of would take varied at different points. The Final Solution, therefore, varied, I think, at different points. And certainly, at the beginning of the war, the Final Solution, I think, to the Jewish problem is one as they see it. I mean, horrible to use this language. It's not a problem. It's the problem of their mentality. But as they described it, the Jewish problem - the way to, quote, \\\"solve,\\\" unquote, this was by evacuation.\\n\\nDAVIES: It's remarkable that you find places where people talk about the notion of mass killings as being uncivilized and un-German.\\n\\nREES: Yes, that's right. Both Heydrich and Himmler say that in the - 1940. And so we know, I think, beyond reasonable doubt that the Final Solution does not mean extermination because in - actually on paper, Himmler and Heydrich are talking about extermination as being uncivilized when later on openly, at his speech at Poznan in 1943, Himmler is talking about physical extermination. Something changes.\\n\\nAnd again, we know that from the documents that - and from eyewitness testimony that in the summer of 1940, they had this - what it seems now at this distance - utterly outlandish, insane plan to transport Jews to Madagascar, the island of Madagascar of Africa. What they anticipated, the Nazis, was that the war was going to end in 1940. Britain would make peace, and they had - would have the French colonies at their disposal, including Madagascar. And the Jews would be able in French ships probably to be shipped there, which is why they were herded into ghettos. Ghettos were only ever seen as a temporary measure prior to expulsion.\\n\\nBut again, as you see time and again in this terrible history, things don't go the way the Nazis want. They're constantly - really, they're always constantly thinking the war's going to end. They keep thinking, any minute now, any moment now, the war's going to stop. We'll have won, and we'll be able to deal with this in this way. And it never does end when they think it's going to end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, the development of this notion of a Final Solution from being the evacuation of Jews to the extermination of Jews you sort of describe as a process of increasing radicalization. Now...\\n\\nDAVIES: What does this mean?\\n\\nREES: So I think one of the best examples of this cumulative radicalization, of the Nazis responding brutally to crises that they themselves have created, occurs in the Lodz ghetto, where what happens is that the Jews have been imprisoned. They've been forced to give up their money to buy food. They've run out of money, so they begin to starve. So then Nazi functionaries face a choice. Some say, let them all starve. Others say, no, no. We need to get something from these people, exploit them. That view prevails. They put them to work in horrible conditions, of course, and they pay them a tiny pittance. But those who are working can actually feed themselves a bit. Other people - the old people, children - are suffering terribly and still starving.\\n\\nAnd actually, one Nazi functionary looks at this situation they themselves have created and can - and writes a note saying, wouldn't it be more humane to kill these people rather than let them starve? So that's an example of how they end up in this position that they themselves have created, where they almost - where someone has the obscenity to write that it's more humane to kill somebody than to leave them to starve.\\n\\nDAVIES: So it's done with this utterly immoral idea of herding people into ghettos with the idea you will transport them out. When you can't transport them out...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...They begin to starve. And one thing leads to another, and then you've come to this utterly horrific conclusion that...\\n\\nREES: Yes. And so what...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...You have to kill people - hundreds of thousands.\\n\\nREES: And also you see - exactly. And what's going on in the minds of a lot of these Nazis - unbelievably, we might think today, rightly - is a sense of annoyance and indignation as - that the Jews have brought this on themselves because the war is still going on, and they can't be expelled.\\n\\nSo I've heard Nazis say - and seen it - that they say, oh, well, of course Churchill is controlled by the Jews. That's why they'd - the British don't do the logical, sensible thing in 1940 and make peace with us.\\n\\nwe're still trapped in this war, and we're in the war as a result of what the Jews are doing. And if the war had gone - if the war had ended, we'd been able to expel the Jews somewhere - where incidentally they would probably have had some form of genocidal horror awaiting them anyway - but they would have been expelled somewhere, and now we can't expel them. What are we supposed to do with them?\\n\\nAnd so this is the kind of mentality that you hear and you see it absolutely plainly now, I think, as a result of a lot of new research around Pearl Harbor, that there are killings going on before Pearl Harbor, notably in Eastern Europe and behind the lines in the war against the Soviet Union. But there's nothing - there is no major death camping operation. But what happens is, as soon as Pearl Harbor happens, you see Hitler's rhetoric change. And he starts talking about, right now it's a world war, and you remember my prophecy of 1939, in which he stated if the Jews succeed in causing a world war, the result will be their annihilation.\\n\\nHe sees this as a fulfillment of a prophecy. He said, if the Jews get involved and cause a world war - America coming into the war is de facto a world war. They simultaneously think the Jews are not just behind Stalin and - but they're behind Roosevelt as well. It's pathological, this stuff. They absolutely believed that I think. And so as a result of that, they absolutely push forward with a massive expansion in the killing around that time, immediately after Pearl Harbor.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to the interview I recorded in 2005 with journalist Laurence Rees, when his book \\\"Auschwitz: A New History\\\" was published.\\n\\nWhen the Nazis first began executing Jews in large numbers, they did it, really, with firing squads. What was the impact of that kind of close-quarter execution on the Germans who carried it out?\\n\\nREES: The impact for quite a substantial proportion of them was terrible. They were emotionally made distraught by this. They're having to shoot women and children at very close range. And this - thus, I believe, begins this journey to the gas chambers that we know of, the infamous gas chambers. And it's because, we see, when Himmler visits Minsk in August 1941, he's told of the emotional problems that the killing in this way, the shooting killings are doing to his men. And he puts in training, as a result, a whole series of experiments to devise a way of killing that is not so emotionally disturbing to his men.\\n\\nI'd always thought that the reason that the gas chambers were devised was primarily to kill people in large numbers. Well, it wasn't just that at all; it was actually so that there was a less emotionally stressful way that the killers could commit murder.\\n\\nDAVIES: They began initially by putting people into a - I guess, in a cabin of some kind and piping exhaust fumes into it.\\n\\nREES: That's right. Well, what happens now again - and we can see this as an example of both cumulative radicalism and competition within the Nazi state - is various people at various different locations come up with different initiatives. What happens is there's an initiative which is the gas van, which is a van where you connect the exhaust back into a compartment hermetically sealed in the rear, where people are gassed. There's the building of the - camp Belzec, which is the first stationary gas chambers, again, using large engines with carbon gases going in to gas them.\\n\\nAnd then at the same time, in September 1941, you find a totally different initiative beginning at Auschwitz, which is the only camp where this initiative begins, which is the use of Zyklon B. Zyklon B is a powerful insecticide using - used for disinfecting rooms. And it was already in Auschwitz, and they used it for delousing prisoners' clothes and rooms because they had a terrible problem with lice because of the inhumane conditions, not least, that prisoners were kept in.\\n\\nAnd one of the functionaries there thinks to himself, well, it's got printed on the Zyklon B cans - dangerous to life; don't go in the room while this is being let off. And he goes, well, actually, of course, if you want to kill people, they should be in the room. So he starts experimenting, not on Jews but on the sick and on Soviet prisoners of war at Auschwitz. And he starts with Zyklon B. The experiments go wrong to start with. They alter doses. They do experiments. And eventually, they evolve a different method of killing to the ones used in the death camps of Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec.\\n\\nDAVIES: Now, as you noted, Auschwitz was not originally conceived of as a death camp, but as a labor camp, which meant that it was large and had lots and lots of barracks. And you note that when the killings of Jews really accelerated in 1942 that this was done not so much at Auschwitz, but at three other camps - at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. And...\\n\\nDAVIES: They were specifically set up as death camps. And you made the point that when visitors go to those sites, they are always shocked at how small they are even though...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...These three camps alone accounted for 1.7 million deaths. Why were these deaths camps so small? How did they function?\\n\\nREES: Because they had no other function than killing. Auschwitz is unique in the history of the Nazi states, unique in the history of the world. It's not just the site of the largest mass murder the world's ever seen as a physical site. It's also unique in the Nazi state in that it's the only camp that combines two functions. It's both a concentration camp and a death camp, and those functions vary at different times in its history.\\n\\nWhat's happening at places like Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor is they are set up in 1942 - all of them open in 1942. They are set up purely to murder Jews. And if you plan on just - just, I say, just - murdering people, one of the shocking things is you need no real space at all. These places are a few hundred yards square - nothing left of them now because the Nazis themselves destroyed these camps in late 1943. They knew that they wanted to keep this their secret. And they were essentially places where trains would arrive, and the Jews would be taken off. And 99 - more than 99% of these people would be dead, probably, within two hours. So there was no stay of any kind, really, at all.\\n\\nA camp like Treblinka, which was capable of killing 300,000 people in little more - in around less than two months in the summer of 1942 - 300,000 people in that one small space - it was run by around 20 Germans and about 100 Ukrainian guards. And these Ukrainians had been mostly selected from prison camps. They had been people fighting on the Russian side who, in the horror of the prison camps that the Germans set up for these Russians where millions died, were offered this chance of saving themselves, to go and work on the German side.\\n\\nAnd then there was the third category of people working in these camps who were, tragically, Jews themselves. The Nazis selected, very occasionally, from incoming transports a number of fit Jewish people and forced them, on pain of their own immediate murder, to participate in the process by cutting people's hair, by showing the way to the gas chamber, by cleaning the gas chambers, by burning the bodies and so on. And the torment that these people went through is scarcely imaginable.\\n\\nDAVIES: So the actual horrific task of murder, of cleaning the bodies, of cleaning out the chambers after the killing has occurred is, by and large, not done by Germans.\\n\\nREES: Never done by Germans, really. No.\\n\\nDAVIES: Yeah. And that was true at Auschwitz as well.\\n\\nREES: So they end up at the huge, industrial-style killing factories of Auschwitz-Birkenau. You have a crematorium gas chamber complex that's capable, in the summer of 1941, of killing 10,000 people in one day - 10,000 people in one day. And it's run by between 2 to 4 Germans and around about 100 Jews. Now, the Nazis save the absolute moment of murder to themselves. They're the ones who drop the canisters of Zyklon B actually into the gas chamber. But pretty much all the other tasks involved in making this operate are run by Jewish Sonderkommando, who we know both from interviewing some - the few people who survived this and also from documents that Jewish Sonderkommando wrote and hid in the foundations of the building often at the time. The torment these people went through was practically indescribable.\\n\\nDAVIES: I was struck by your description of the arrival buildings at the death camps, that they often were fairly pleasant-looking, I mean, with flower plantings and the kind - I guess designed to reinsure the incoming inmates...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...That their fate was not what it was going to be.\\n\\nREES: Again, this is all part of the cynicism, but it's also part of the learning curve that the Nazis go on because what happens at Treblinka, which was the most deadly, if you like, of all of these death camps outside of Auschwitz - they were killing so many people that the system broke down - summer of 1942 - that the system broke down. There were bodies everywhere. There was just mayhem, people being shot. It was chaos.\\n\\nSo they actually had to shut it down and reorganize it. And the new commander of Treblinka, what he managed to do as he pushed it forward was come up with all of these devices like the fake railway station, fake timetables, lovely flowers - same thing happened at Sobibor. One of the most extraordinary individuals I've ever met, Toivi Blatt, who survived Sobibor, said, actually, when he got off there, he'd been expecting some horrible place. He said, it was always beautiful. And as you say, it's all designed so that when, say, Jews coming from Holland arrive, they're told, you are at a transit station, hygiene stop while - we just need to take a shower, have your hair cut and we're going to move on east. And it's deliberately designed to do that.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more from him after a break, and we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. Monday, January 27 is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, based on more than 100 interviews with survivors and Nazi perpetrators. It's called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nDAVIES: You note that Auschwitz became, really, a death camp at a point when the Nazi death machine had become very well-developed, and Nazi initiative and ingenuity had addressed some of the technical difficulties of mass murder and had worked out solutions. Tell us a bit about those arriving Jews who were selected for immediate death. What exactly faced them, and who did the work?\\n\\nREES: Well, they would be taken from the - by the time - in 1944, by the time this became the most sophisticated procedure, they'd be taken straight from the arrival ramp, which was the area they arrived at, directly inside Birkenau. The railway line ran into the camp. They'd be taken, really, a few hundred yards round to one of four combination gas chamber-crematoriums.\\n\\nThey would then be taken down in two - cases of two of them, they'd be taken on - all on ground level. The other two - one had basement, undressing rooms and gas chambers. They'd be taken down or into a room where they'd be told to undress because they were going to have to have a shower as part of the camp's admittance procedure. And they would then be crammed into an airtight room - the door shut, locked behind them.\\n\\nAnd then either from above, in the case of the basement gas chambers or through the windows of the ones all on the ground floor, canisters of Zyklon B would be thrown in. And it would normally - it would take - dependent on how many people were in these gas chambers, dependent on the weather because Zyklon B was more effective the warmer the air was - it would take 15, 20 minutes for these people to die, I think, a horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible death of suffocation and poisoning.\\n\\nThe gas chambers would then be opened. The Sonderkommando, Jewish - other Jewish prisoners with gas masks, would have to go in, would take out the bodies, would - in the case of the adults - go through them and take out the gold teeth, would shave the hair of the women. The bodies would then be pushed into lifts taken up to the first - to the ground level or the basement gas chambers, where the bodies would be burned. And then their ashes would be collected and either thrown in the immediate area or taken down to the nearby river, Vistula. So that was the horror of the process that they devised in the end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Were many of the SS officials who conducted the murder at Auschwitz held accountable for their actions?\\n\\nREES: Well, I think this is one of the great scandals of this story, a story rich in scandal at every level. But this is one of the greater scandals, which is that less than - well, maybe, 12%, 10% of SS people who worked at Auschwitz were ever prosecuted. Around 90% of the SS who worked at Auschwitz during the war escaped all forms of prosecution. And myself, I think that's a scandal.\\n\\nDAVIES: Why was that?\\n\\nREES: One of the reasons that so few people were prosecuted was that by the 1960s, the German prosecutors had taken the view that unless a member of the SS was absolutely directly involved in the killing or had been directly involved in acts of brutality - physical brutality - then they could get off scot-free. And of course, it meant that the way that the gas chambers had been devised, which was that so few Germans were needed for their actual physical operation, it meant that the vast majority of SS at the camp could say, oh, I wasn't really directly involved in the killing at all.\\n\\nNow, myself, I think that's a calamity. That's terrible because, of course, if you're working in the currency units counting out money, if you're working in the SS transport division, if you're a guard at the camp, you are directly involved in the operation of the camp that results - that's an extermination center. So I certainly disagree with - you know, for all the good it's going to do anybody that I disagree, but I certainly disagree that they took that view.\\n\\nDAVIES: In this book, you compare the crimes of the Holocaust to other mass exterminations in history - going as far back as Genghis Khan's genocide in Persia - and conclude that this represents the lowest act in human history and should not be allowed to recede into distant memory as some of these other mass killings have. What's different about this extermination?\\n\\nREES: I think that if you're looking at how you should think about events in the past - or even events in the present, actually - what you've got to do is look at the overall circumstances in which these things happen. You know, it's not much good thinking, well, oh, the Vikings were terrible. Well, the Vikings operated in a system of values at the time that was - they were, by all accounts from latest research on Vikings, for example, scarcely better or worse than any other 10th century marauding hordes. I mean, it's a ludicrous - it seems to me a ludicrous way to go to start blaming Vikings for being Vikings.\\n\\nSomething different is going on here. What's happening is that you are taking a cultured nation at the heart of Europe in the 20th century, long after the Enlightenment, that has adopted absolute civilized cultural values in the wake of the end of the first world war. It is a thriving, although troubled, democracy. Its take - it's got rid of all legislation against Jews. It's liberal in that regard. All of these things are going on. It's got a great written culture. It's got a great musical culture. It's got a great artistic culture. It's the place you would think would be the most civilized almost to be. And yet that very place, within a matter of years, turns into this.\\n\\nSo you've got a journey that they go on that's unlike - and it's not like the journey the Vikings go on or Genghis Khan or the plains goes on. This is not like that. This is a different journey. This is a journey from one pole - one extreme, if you like, to the other extreme. And in the process, they use 20th-century technology that they warp and adapt to this very service of mass killing. And unlike Stalin, who even at his worst, when he was deporting entire nations - the Kalmyk nations, the Crimean Tatars and so on. He's deporting whole nations to Siberia. Even Stalin isn't trying to put forward measures to eliminate them in their entirety. So something different, I think, is going on here.\\n\\nDAVIES: So many students of Nazism and the Holocaust have tried to in some way answer the question, how could this happen? You've interviewed a hundred or so survivors and war criminals from Auschwitz. Do you feel you have some new insights into that question?\\n\\nREES: I think what surprised me about this - because I never intended this career (laughter). Like, this kind of happened to me, you know, that I've been - written so much on this and made so many programs on this. And one of the reasons it's happened is because I keep thinking I'm getting close to being able to answer that properly. And as I - as I keep getting towards it, it keeps going away from me a bit more. So I think I'm a long way down the road, I hope, to being able to get to there. But I'm not there yet. Maybe it's absolutely impossible to get there.\\n\\nBut one thing I took from this was a big fear I've now got about people of absolute faith. I always thought faith of itself was - could only be a positive thing. Everyone talks about the importance of having faith. Well, these guys had faith, absolute faith. And there's one really desperately upsetting - all desperately upsetting. But ideologically, there's one desperately particularly upsetting moment where - in the book where I talk about how Himmler and Hoss most admired, as prisoners, Jehovah's Witnesses. They pointed to them and said, see that faith? That's the kind of faith we need in our fuhrer - absolute, unshakable faith.\\n\\nNow, of course, no one is equating what the Nazis did with Jehovah's Witnesses, who operate a whole creed of peace and love and so on. Absolutely. But the very notion of absolute faith is at the core of this. And so I'm beginning to start to have questions about people who - or communities that are absolutely certain about things.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, Laurence Rees, thanks so much for speaking with us.\\n\\nREES: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" After a break, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: Today we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Next, we'll hear Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016 at the age of 87. Wiesel was born in what was then Romania and was 15 when he and his family were sent from Hungary to Auschwitz in 1944. He was later moved to another camp, Buchenwald, from which he was liberated in 1945. Among his family, only two of his sisters survived the war.\\n\\nWiesel became one of the first survivors to devote his life to bearing witness to the Holocaust. His memoir, \\\"Night,\\\" was published in English in 1960, and he spent the rest of his life speaking about social injustice. Terry spoke with him in 1988 when his novel \\\"Twilight\\\" was published.\\n\\nTERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Why have you made it your life work to bear witness?\\n\\nELIE WIESEL: What else could one do, having gone through certain events? I believe a human being, if he or she wants to remain human, then he or she must do something with what we have seen, endured, witnessed. Not to live through an experience, but the experience is there - it's bad, but not to communicate it is worse.\\n\\nGROSS: You know, I think that it's almost a human instinct to let time dim memories of horror and tragedy. Have you fought that in a way? Have you tried to keep those memories alive so that you can continue to communicate about them?\\n\\nWIESEL: Naturally. I mean, naturally, the human being wants to forget pain. In this case, although, for most of those who went through the experience during the war, they want to remember more and more and more. They go deep into their own consciousness, into their own memory, trying to find more events, more faces, more eyes, more words, more sighs, more tears, more agonies. It's never enough because we feel that we have to tell the story, and no one can tell the story fully.\\n\\nGROSS: You once described Auschwitz as the defeat of the intellect that wants to find a meaning, with a capital M, in history. Do you feel that, nevertheless, you've been really spending your life trying to find some meaning of the Holocaust, some larger meaning you could tell us about man or about God?\\n\\nWIESEL: I'll tell you, all the questions I had remain open. I really don't believe that I found any answer to any one of the questions I had. I don't know the meaning. I don't know why it happened. I don't know how it happened. I still don't know anything, really. I'm trying to tell a story, and even the story cannot be told. And therefore, it cannot be communicated, and therefore, people - and deep down, I know - won't receive the testimony that we are giving. We are a very special kind of writers, those who write about that event. And I write very little about it, really. But I know that people cannot understand.\\n\\nGROSS: I think when you were in the camps, you saw some religious people stop praying and saw people who had not been observant turn to God. You had been very observant and very immersed in the religious texts when you were young, before you were deported to the concentration camps. How did your experiences and your survival in the camps change your own experience of religion?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, the change - to the extent that it occurred - did not occur there. It's afterwards that the problems became urgent. Inside that universe, we continued praying. We continued believing. We continued affirming. We needed that link with our past. It's only after the war that I began asking questions, and I began articulating a certain protest. And that protest is still with me. I am still angry at all the forces in history that provoked such a catastrophe. That doesn't mean that my faith left me or that I left fate. I try to develop a certain protest within fate.\\n\\nGROSS: Have you gone back to the religious texts that you were reading when you were young?\\n\\nWIESEL: I never stopped reading or studying. Even inside that universe, I studied. I had a teacher there with name I never knew and whose face I hardly saw. But he was a teacher, the head of a Talmudic school in Galicia. And we work together, and we studied together. I know. It's incredible.\\n\\nGROSS: This is in the camps.\\n\\nWIESEL: Inside - in Auschwitz. So we studied. They kept on studying from morning to evening. And after the war, the first thing I wanted was a book, was a Talmudic treatise. I never stopped studying. That probably saved me.\\n\\nGROSS: In your first novel, \\\"Night...\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: \\\"Night\\\" was not a novel. It was a memoir.\\n\\nGROSS: I don't know why I think of it as a novel.\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Every word...\\n\\nGROSS: I think of think of it as a very autobiographical novel, but...\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah. Well, I - then I guess I was going to ask you about your religious teacher who narrowly escaped from being murdered with hundreds or thousands of other Jews in the forest by the SS. And he somehow managed to escape and come back to your village to warn people about what was happening, and no one would listen.\\n\\nWIESEL: We didn't listen because he was a simple man. He was a beetle. Had he been an important person, I think some people would have listened. What is so extraordinary is when we remember today the silence, the indifference of so many people who were not inside the tragedy but on the other side, just imagine if we had heard on the radio Ben-Gurion from Israel or Roosevelt or Churchill telling Hungarian Jews don't go because they are killing. They're massacring. I think they would have believed them. But why should one believe a beetle, a man who came back from the other side and was telling such atrocious stories?\\n\\nGROSS: We're getting back to the question of madness. I think a lot of people in your village just assumed he'd lost his mind and was making up - you know, was having visions or something, that this couldn't possibly have happened.\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, absolutely. I myself - I was very close to him. And we spent many, many hours alone together every evening. And I would listen to him. Plus, I love to listen to stories, even to his stories, maybe especially to hear stories. But I didn't believe them.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel recorded in 1988. Wiesel died in 2016.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you do anything to mentally prepare for what was in store when your father told you that the next day the whole village was going to be deported, the whole ghetto was going to be deported?\\n\\nWIESEL: No. We didn't know. See; Hungarian Jewry was deported at such a pace. Everything came so fast. The Hungarians allowed the Germans to come in in March. The end of May, all the Jews were out already in Germany. In less than six weeks, Eichmann had managed to deport to their death more than 600,000 Jews - men, women and children. So it came very fast. And it ended very fast. We didn't have time to think.\\n\\nGROSS: You've described yourself as having been very weak and sickly when you were young. I know you think of yourself as having survived purely by chance. Did you learn things, though, to help you survive when you were in the camps?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Not at all. I was the wrong person, the wrong candidate for survival. I was always weak, as you said, and disarmed, cowardly. I would never try to do anything, which was not what I could have done or should have done. I never asked for a supplement of anything. I didn't volunteer. I was always pleased to think that I could be invisible. Not to make myself visible was my task. I don't know why I survived. I don't know how I survived. It was really by accident.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you know when you got out of the camps that you wanted to write?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, I knew that I was going to write before I entered the camps. I come from a tradition, from the Jewish tradition, we believe - which believes in words, in language, in communication. And already at the age of 12 or 13, I was writing. Of course, it wasn't good. It meant nothing, but I tried to write. I even found the manuscript. I went back to my hometown. It's not good. But I tried.\\n\\nAfterwards, I knew I would have to bear witness. Everyone who was there is a witness, and everyone who was there is a true witness. Others who are trying to speak about this subject occasionally are false witnesses. And I felt that I had to be a true witness. And therefore, I decided to wait for 10 years, not to speak about it but to use language related to these experiences until I knew that the words were true words.\\n\\nGROSS: Why 10 years? Why not five years? Why not one year? No, seriously. What made you think..\\n\\nGROSS: ...That 10 years is what you needed to really know what it was you wanted to say and what words you wanted to say it with?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, 10 is a biblical figure, I know. And the - it's a good figure, why not? I cannot tell you that I got up one morning and decided that - let's see, that five or six or seven. It entered my mind - it has to be 10. I decided 10.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you actually have an anniversary where like...\\n\\nGROSS: And that day you sat down to write.\\n\\nGROSS: And is that when you started to write \\\"Night?\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" yes. That's when I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" on April 11, 1955, which is 10 years later.\\n\\nGROSS: And looking back, do you think that this was definitely the right thing to do, to wait those 10 years? In what ways were you changed as a witness and as a writer during those 10 years?\\n\\nWIESEL: Maybe I didn't change, but the words in me changed. They grew. you know, Words have strange destiny, too. They grow, they get old, they die, they come back. Words can be turned into spears. They can be turned into prayers. It's a strange world that you are in when you deal with words.\\n\\nGROSS: In one of your essays, you wrote that after the war, you deliberately avoided all contact with Germans and that their presence sickened you physically. Did that change? And if so, what changed that?\\n\\nWIESEL: It did. But I didn't want to go back to Germany, really. I went once because I didn't want to judge people. I went once in the early '60s to do a piece for commentary. And I realized that every person I see in the street, I judge him or her asking, where was he, what did he do, how old is he, could I - could he have been there? And I didn't want that role, so I didn't go back. But I did go back last year in '86, '87.\\n\\nToday, you have a young generation of Germans. And I do not believe in collective guilt. So I have absolutely no problem with the young Germans. I even feel sorry for the young Germans because to be maybe sons or daughters of killers is different than to be sons and daughters of the victims. And I felt sorry for them. I still do.\\n\\nGROSS: The generations of survivors are getting older. The older generation of survivors is no longer with us. Are you concerned about what's going to happen after the generations of survivors pass on, like, who will be around to actually speak the memories?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, I'm profoundly concerned, naturally. In one of my novels, I try to describe that feeling of the last survivor, what it means to be the very last. And I would not want to be that last survivor. But on the other hand, we are leaving a legacy. We are bequeathing a certain message, a certain story. This tragedy is the most documented tragedy in recorded history. And therefore later on, if there will be a later on, anyone wishing to know will know where to go for knowledge.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988.

I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Monday, January 27, is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Today we're going to listen to two interviews. In a bit, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016. But first, we'll listen to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, the site of history's largest mass murder, as well as insights into Hitler's campaign of genocide against the Jews of Europe.\\n\\nRees' book is based on more than a hundred interviews with Auschwitz survivors and Nazi perpetrators, many of whom spoke on the record for the first time. He believes his search for the truth was aided by the fact that surviving Nazis had reached an age where candor no longer jeopardized careers and by the fall of communism, which opened up a wealth of new archival material. His book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nLAURENCE REES: Thank you very much.\\n\\nDAVIES: You note early in this book that you were one of relatively few people who've been able to interview quite a number of war criminals from three of the great totalitarian powers of the 20th century - that is, Stalinist Russia, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. And you say in this book that having done so, you can confirm that Nazi war criminals that you met were different from the other two.\\n\\nDAVIES: How were they different?\\n\\nREES: They're different in a kind of paradoxical way because when I grew up at school and first heard about the Nazis and - the whole line that was taken then in the '70s was that Nazi war criminals would give us the standard defense. Oh, I was only - I was acting under orders. I was acting under orders. And so that was kind of what you imagine, when you meet people like this, they're going to say. Well, paradoxically, that was the kind of response I got from Stalin's secret policemen, from members of the Imperial Army who committed terrible crimes in China and in the Pacific War. That was what they were saying. I didn't tend to get that from Nazi war criminals. The frightening thing to me - particularly frightening - was that most of the Nazi war criminals I've met actually, when you push them, say, well - and you say, well, why were you doing this - don't say, I was acting on your orders. Say, well, at the time, I thought what I was doing was right.\\n\\nDAVIES: And what do you attribute that to? I mean, they seemed to be true believers in the cause.\\n\\nREES: I think it's a variety of things that, in the end, for me, mean that Nazism is more horrible but more interesting as a phenomenon. I think it's to do with the fact that, certainly, if you were a secret policeman in Stalin's Russia, I think for the most part, the terror was so ubiquitous that no one was safe from the knock at the door. No one could really understand exactly why individuals were sometimes being targeted. Stalin famously had one of his own Politburo, Molotov's wife, tortured. I've talked to people who were at meetings where they stood up and were denouncing other people as enemies of the state because they were worried they'd be denounced. There didn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to some of this. So this means that the only way of making sense of it, really, for a lot of these people doing the bad things was to say, well, you know, I was doing it because I'm ordered to do it.\\n\\nSimilarly, in Imperial Japan, the level of training - the brutality of the training of Japanese soldiers, I think, is without parallel in the modern world, what these people were put through in training - bullying, the vicious beatings and so on, the indoctrination as well. But it was such that if you didn't - you know, you obeyed, and you obeyed blindly, I think, in a number of cases.\\n\\nWhat's going on in Germany is rather different. What's going on in Germany is that - I think to some extent thanks to the work of Goebbels, who - again, a horrible, nasty person, but the genius of propaganda of the 20th century. Thanks to the work of Goebbels, but also thanks to the fact that there was a genuine feeling of injustice in Germany after the end of the First World War. There was a feeling put about that Jews were to blame. There was a feeling of fear of communism, that Jews were somehow falsely attributed in their totality to communism. Simultaneously, Jews were thought to be running Roosevelt in American politics, anti-German and so on. So there were a whole series of what they took to be, at the time, pragmatic, positive reasons to do what they were doing, and that's one of the frightening things about it.\\n\\nDAVIES: When the Nazis spoke of achieving the Final Solution to the Jewish problem in the early years of the war, is it clear they meant extermination of the Jews?\\n\\nREES: No, they didn't mean extermination, I don't believe. It's clear that the words Final Solution change in meaning, I believe, during 1941. When Heydrich is charged by Goring with organizing the Final Solution to the Jewish problem, initially, the order explicitly states evacuation. And that was the overt policy, certainly, since 1938 and the Anschluss with Austria. When the German troops go into Austria, they, under Eichmann of the SS of - you know, later absolutely infamous for being one of the organizers of the murders in the Final Solution - he organizes a system of expropriation, of robbing, of treating violently the Jews of Vienna, robbing them and then those who can almost pay to go, expelling them.\\n\\nI think that what's clear is that Hitler always hated the Jews. He always loathed the Jews. He always wanted rid of the Jews in one way or another. The form that that wanting rid of would take varied at different points. The Final Solution, therefore, varied, I think, at different points. And certainly, at the beginning of the war, the Final Solution, I think, to the Jewish problem is one as they see it. I mean, horrible to use this language. It's not a problem. It's the problem of their mentality. But as they described it, the Jewish problem - the way to, quote, \\\"solve,\\\" unquote, this was by evacuation.\\n\\nDAVIES: It's remarkable that you find places where people talk about the notion of mass killings as being uncivilized and un-German.\\n\\nREES: Yes, that's right. Both Heydrich and Himmler say that in the - 1940. And so we know, I think, beyond reasonable doubt that the Final Solution does not mean extermination because in - actually on paper, Himmler and Heydrich are talking about extermination as being uncivilized when later on openly, at his speech at Poznan in 1943, Himmler is talking about physical extermination. Something changes.\\n\\nAnd again, we know that from the documents that - and from eyewitness testimony that in the summer of 1940, they had this - what it seems now at this distance - utterly outlandish, insane plan to transport Jews to Madagascar, the island of Madagascar of Africa. What they anticipated, the Nazis, was that the war was going to end in 1940. Britain would make peace, and they had - would have the French colonies at their disposal, including Madagascar. And the Jews would be able in French ships probably to be shipped there, which is why they were herded into ghettos. Ghettos were only ever seen as a temporary measure prior to expulsion.\\n\\nBut again, as you see time and again in this terrible history, things don't go the way the Nazis want. They're constantly - really, they're always constantly thinking the war's going to end. They keep thinking, any minute now, any moment now, the war's going to stop. We'll have won, and we'll be able to deal with this in this way. And it never does end when they think it's going to end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, the development of this notion of a Final Solution from being the evacuation of Jews to the extermination of Jews you sort of describe as a process of increasing radicalization. Now...\\n\\nDAVIES: What does this mean?\\n\\nREES: So I think one of the best examples of this cumulative radicalization, of the Nazis responding brutally to crises that they themselves have created, occurs in the Lodz ghetto, where what happens is that the Jews have been imprisoned. They've been forced to give up their money to buy food. They've run out of money, so they begin to starve. So then Nazi functionaries face a choice. Some say, let them all starve. Others say, no, no. We need to get something from these people, exploit them. That view prevails. They put them to work in horrible conditions, of course, and they pay them a tiny pittance. But those who are working can actually feed themselves a bit. Other people - the old people, children - are suffering terribly and still starving.\\n\\nAnd actually, one Nazi functionary looks at this situation they themselves have created and can - and writes a note saying, wouldn't it be more humane to kill these people rather than let them starve? So that's an example of how they end up in this position that they themselves have created, where they almost - where someone has the obscenity to write that it's more humane to kill somebody than to leave them to starve.\\n\\nDAVIES: So it's done with this utterly immoral idea of herding people into ghettos with the idea you will transport them out. When you can't transport them out...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...They begin to starve. And one thing leads to another, and then you've come to this utterly horrific conclusion that...\\n\\nREES: Yes. And so what...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...You have to kill people - hundreds of thousands.\\n\\nREES: And also you see - exactly. And what's going on in the minds of a lot of these Nazis - unbelievably, we might think today, rightly - is a sense of annoyance and indignation as - that the Jews have brought this on themselves because the war is still going on, and they can't be expelled.\\n\\nSo I've heard Nazis say - and seen it - that they say, oh, well, of course Churchill is controlled by the Jews. That's why they'd - the British don't do the logical, sensible thing in 1940 and make peace with us.\\n\\nwe're still trapped in this war, and we're in the war as a result of what the Jews are doing. And if the war had gone - if the war had ended, we'd been able to expel the Jews somewhere - where incidentally they would probably have had some form of genocidal horror awaiting them anyway - but they would have been expelled somewhere, and now we can't expel them. What are we supposed to do with them?\\n\\nAnd so this is the kind of mentality that you hear and you see it absolutely plainly now, I think, as a result of a lot of new research around Pearl Harbor, that there are killings going on before Pearl Harbor, notably in Eastern Europe and behind the lines in the war against the Soviet Union. But there's nothing - there is no major death camping operation. But what happens is, as soon as Pearl Harbor happens, you see Hitler's rhetoric change. And he starts talking about, right now it's a world war, and you remember my prophecy of 1939, in which he stated if the Jews succeed in causing a world war, the result will be their annihilation.\\n\\nHe sees this as a fulfillment of a prophecy. He said, if the Jews get involved and cause a world war - America coming into the war is de facto a world war. They simultaneously think the Jews are not just behind Stalin and - but they're behind Roosevelt as well. It's pathological, this stuff. They absolutely believed that I think. And so as a result of that, they absolutely push forward with a massive expansion in the killing around that time, immediately after Pearl Harbor.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to the interview I recorded in 2005 with journalist Laurence Rees, when his book \\\"Auschwitz: A New History\\\" was published.\\n\\nWhen the Nazis first began executing Jews in large numbers, they did it, really, with firing squads. What was the impact of that kind of close-quarter execution on the Germans who carried it out?\\n\\nREES: The impact for quite a substantial proportion of them was terrible. They were emotionally made distraught by this. They're having to shoot women and children at very close range. And this - thus, I believe, begins this journey to the gas chambers that we know of, the infamous gas chambers. And it's because, we see, when Himmler visits Minsk in August 1941, he's told of the emotional problems that the killing in this way, the shooting killings are doing to his men. And he puts in training, as a result, a whole series of experiments to devise a way of killing that is not so emotionally disturbing to his men.\\n\\nI'd always thought that the reason that the gas chambers were devised was primarily to kill people in large numbers. Well, it wasn't just that at all; it was actually so that there was a less emotionally stressful way that the killers could commit murder.\\n\\nDAVIES: They began initially by putting people into a - I guess, in a cabin of some kind and piping exhaust fumes into it.\\n\\nREES: That's right. Well, what happens now again - and we can see this as an example of both cumulative radicalism and competition within the Nazi state - is various people at various different locations come up with different initiatives. What happens is there's an initiative which is the gas van, which is a van where you connect the exhaust back into a compartment hermetically sealed in the rear, where people are gassed. There's the building of the - camp Belzec, which is the first stationary gas chambers, again, using large engines with carbon gases going in to gas them.\\n\\nAnd then at the same time, in September 1941, you find a totally different initiative beginning at Auschwitz, which is the only camp where this initiative begins, which is the use of Zyklon B. Zyklon B is a powerful insecticide using - used for disinfecting rooms. And it was already in Auschwitz, and they used it for delousing prisoners' clothes and rooms because they had a terrible problem with lice because of the inhumane conditions, not least, that prisoners were kept in.\\n\\nAnd one of the functionaries there thinks to himself, well, it's got printed on the Zyklon B cans - dangerous to life; don't go in the room while this is being let off. And he goes, well, actually, of course, if you want to kill people, they should be in the room. So he starts experimenting, not on Jews but on the sick and on Soviet prisoners of war at Auschwitz. And he starts with Zyklon B. The experiments go wrong to start with. They alter doses. They do experiments. And eventually, they evolve a different method of killing to the ones used in the death camps of Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec.\\n\\nDAVIES: Now, as you noted, Auschwitz was not originally conceived of as a death camp, but as a labor camp, which meant that it was large and had lots and lots of barracks. And you note that when the killings of Jews really accelerated in 1942 that this was done not so much at Auschwitz, but at three other camps - at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. And...\\n\\nDAVIES: They were specifically set up as death camps. And you made the point that when visitors go to those sites, they are always shocked at how small they are even though...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...These three camps alone accounted for 1.7 million deaths. Why were these deaths camps so small? How did they function?\\n\\nREES: Because they had no other function than killing. Auschwitz is unique in the history of the Nazi states, unique in the history of the world. It's not just the site of the largest mass murder the world's ever seen as a physical site. It's also unique in the Nazi state in that it's the only camp that combines two functions. It's both a concentration camp and a death camp, and those functions vary at different times in its history.\\n\\nWhat's happening at places like Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor is they are set up in 1942 - all of them open in 1942. They are set up purely to murder Jews. And if you plan on just - just, I say, just - murdering people, one of the shocking things is you need no real space at all. These places are a few hundred yards square - nothing left of them now because the Nazis themselves destroyed these camps in late 1943. They knew that they wanted to keep this their secret. And they were essentially places where trains would arrive, and the Jews would be taken off. And 99 - more than 99% of these people would be dead, probably, within two hours. So there was no stay of any kind, really, at all.\\n\\nA camp like Treblinka, which was capable of killing 300,000 people in little more - in around less than two months in the summer of 1942 - 300,000 people in that one small space - it was run by around 20 Germans and about 100 Ukrainian guards. And these Ukrainians had been mostly selected from prison camps. They had been people fighting on the Russian side who, in the horror of the prison camps that the Germans set up for these Russians where millions died, were offered this chance of saving themselves, to go and work on the German side.\\n\\nAnd then there was the third category of people working in these camps who were, tragically, Jews themselves. The Nazis selected, very occasionally, from incoming transports a number of fit Jewish people and forced them, on pain of their own immediate murder, to participate in the process by cutting people's hair, by showing the way to the gas chamber, by cleaning the gas chambers, by burning the bodies and so on. And the torment that these people went through is scarcely imaginable.\\n\\nDAVIES: So the actual horrific task of murder, of cleaning the bodies, of cleaning out the chambers after the killing has occurred is, by and large, not done by Germans.\\n\\nREES: Never done by Germans, really. No.\\n\\nDAVIES: Yeah. And that was true at Auschwitz as well.\\n\\nREES: So they end up at the huge, industrial-style killing factories of Auschwitz-Birkenau. You have a crematorium gas chamber complex that's capable, in the summer of 1941, of killing 10,000 people in one day - 10,000 people in one day. And it's run by between 2 to 4 Germans and around about 100 Jews. Now, the Nazis save the absolute moment of murder to themselves. They're the ones who drop the canisters of Zyklon B actually into the gas chamber. But pretty much all the other tasks involved in making this operate are run by Jewish Sonderkommando, who we know both from interviewing some - the few people who survived this and also from documents that Jewish Sonderkommando wrote and hid in the foundations of the building often at the time. The torment these people went through was practically indescribable.\\n\\nDAVIES: I was struck by your description of the arrival buildings at the death camps, that they often were fairly pleasant-looking, I mean, with flower plantings and the kind - I guess designed to reinsure the incoming inmates...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...That their fate was not what it was going to be.\\n\\nREES: Again, this is all part of the cynicism, but it's also part of the learning curve that the Nazis go on because what happens at Treblinka, which was the most deadly, if you like, of all of these death camps outside of Auschwitz - they were killing so many people that the system broke down - summer of 1942 - that the system broke down. There were bodies everywhere. There was just mayhem, people being shot. It was chaos.\\n\\nSo they actually had to shut it down and reorganize it. And the new commander of Treblinka, what he managed to do as he pushed it forward was come up with all of these devices like the fake railway station, fake timetables, lovely flowers - same thing happened at Sobibor. One of the most extraordinary individuals I've ever met, Toivi Blatt, who survived Sobibor, said, actually, when he got off there, he'd been expecting some horrible place. He said, it was always beautiful. And as you say, it's all designed so that when, say, Jews coming from Holland arrive, they're told, you are at a transit station, hygiene stop while - we just need to take a shower, have your hair cut and we're going to move on east. And it's deliberately designed to do that.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more from him after a break, and we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. Monday, January 27 is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, based on more than 100 interviews with survivors and Nazi perpetrators. It's called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nDAVIES: You note that Auschwitz became, really, a death camp at a point when the Nazi death machine had become very well-developed, and Nazi initiative and ingenuity had addressed some of the technical difficulties of mass murder and had worked out solutions. Tell us a bit about those arriving Jews who were selected for immediate death. What exactly faced them, and who did the work?\\n\\nREES: Well, they would be taken from the - by the time - in 1944, by the time this became the most sophisticated procedure, they'd be taken straight from the arrival ramp, which was the area they arrived at, directly inside Birkenau. The railway line ran into the camp. They'd be taken, really, a few hundred yards round to one of four combination gas chamber-crematoriums.\\n\\nThey would then be taken down in two - cases of two of them, they'd be taken on - all on ground level. The other two - one had basement, undressing rooms and gas chambers. They'd be taken down or into a room where they'd be told to undress because they were going to have to have a shower as part of the camp's admittance procedure. And they would then be crammed into an airtight room - the door shut, locked behind them.\\n\\nAnd then either from above, in the case of the basement gas chambers or through the windows of the ones all on the ground floor, canisters of Zyklon B would be thrown in. And it would normally - it would take - dependent on how many people were in these gas chambers, dependent on the weather because Zyklon B was more effective the warmer the air was - it would take 15, 20 minutes for these people to die, I think, a horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible death of suffocation and poisoning.\\n\\nThe gas chambers would then be opened. The Sonderkommando, Jewish - other Jewish prisoners with gas masks, would have to go in, would take out the bodies, would - in the case of the adults - go through them and take out the gold teeth, would shave the hair of the women. The bodies would then be pushed into lifts taken up to the first - to the ground level or the basement gas chambers, where the bodies would be burned. And then their ashes would be collected and either thrown in the immediate area or taken down to the nearby river, Vistula. So that was the horror of the process that they devised in the end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Were many of the SS officials who conducted the murder at Auschwitz held accountable for their actions?\\n\\nREES: Well, I think this is one of the great scandals of this story, a story rich in scandal at every level. But this is one of the greater scandals, which is that less than - well, maybe, 12%, 10% of SS people who worked at Auschwitz were ever prosecuted. Around 90% of the SS who worked at Auschwitz during the war escaped all forms of prosecution. And myself, I think that's a scandal.\\n\\nDAVIES: Why was that?\\n\\nREES: One of the reasons that so few people were prosecuted was that by the 1960s, the German prosecutors had taken the view that unless a member of the SS was absolutely directly involved in the killing or had been directly involved in acts of brutality - physical brutality - then they could get off scot-free. And of course, it meant that the way that the gas chambers had been devised, which was that so few Germans were needed for their actual physical operation, it meant that the vast majority of SS at the camp could say, oh, I wasn't really directly involved in the killing at all.\\n\\nNow, myself, I think that's a calamity. That's terrible because, of course, if you're working in the currency units counting out money, if you're working in the SS transport division, if you're a guard at the camp, you are directly involved in the operation of the camp that results - that's an extermination center. So I certainly disagree with - you know, for all the good it's going to do anybody that I disagree, but I certainly disagree that they took that view.\\n\\nDAVIES: In this book, you compare the crimes of the Holocaust to other mass exterminations in history - going as far back as Genghis Khan's genocide in Persia - and conclude that this represents the lowest act in human history and should not be allowed to recede into distant memory as some of these other mass killings have. What's different about this extermination?\\n\\nREES: I think that if you're looking at how you should think about events in the past - or even events in the present, actually - what you've got to do is look at the overall circumstances in which these things happen. You know, it's not much good thinking, well, oh, the Vikings were terrible. Well, the Vikings operated in a system of values at the time that was - they were, by all accounts from latest research on Vikings, for example, scarcely better or worse than any other 10th century marauding hordes. I mean, it's a ludicrous - it seems to me a ludicrous way to go to start blaming Vikings for being Vikings.\\n\\nSomething different is going on here. What's happening is that you are taking a cultured nation at the heart of Europe in the 20th century, long after the Enlightenment, that has adopted absolute civilized cultural values in the wake of the end of the first world war. It is a thriving, although troubled, democracy. Its take - it's got rid of all legislation against Jews. It's liberal in that regard. All of these things are going on. It's got a great written culture. It's got a great musical culture. It's got a great artistic culture. It's the place you would think would be the most civilized almost to be. And yet that very place, within a matter of years, turns into this.\\n\\nSo you've got a journey that they go on that's unlike - and it's not like the journey the Vikings go on or Genghis Khan or the plains goes on. This is not like that. This is a different journey. This is a journey from one pole - one extreme, if you like, to the other extreme. And in the process, they use 20th-century technology that they warp and adapt to this very service of mass killing. And unlike Stalin, who even at his worst, when he was deporting entire nations - the Kalmyk nations, the Crimean Tatars and so on. He's deporting whole nations to Siberia. Even Stalin isn't trying to put forward measures to eliminate them in their entirety. So something different, I think, is going on here.\\n\\nDAVIES: So many students of Nazism and the Holocaust have tried to in some way answer the question, how could this happen? You've interviewed a hundred or so survivors and war criminals from Auschwitz. Do you feel you have some new insights into that question?\\n\\nREES: I think what surprised me about this - because I never intended this career (laughter). Like, this kind of happened to me, you know, that I've been - written so much on this and made so many programs on this. And one of the reasons it's happened is because I keep thinking I'm getting close to being able to answer that properly. And as I - as I keep getting towards it, it keeps going away from me a bit more. So I think I'm a long way down the road, I hope, to being able to get to there. But I'm not there yet. Maybe it's absolutely impossible to get there.\\n\\nBut one thing I took from this was a big fear I've now got about people of absolute faith. I always thought faith of itself was - could only be a positive thing. Everyone talks about the importance of having faith. Well, these guys had faith, absolute faith. And there's one really desperately upsetting - all desperately upsetting. But ideologically, there's one desperately particularly upsetting moment where - in the book where I talk about how Himmler and Hoss most admired, as prisoners, Jehovah's Witnesses. They pointed to them and said, see that faith? That's the kind of faith we need in our fuhrer - absolute, unshakable faith.\\n\\nNow, of course, no one is equating what the Nazis did with Jehovah's Witnesses, who operate a whole creed of peace and love and so on. Absolutely. But the very notion of absolute faith is at the core of this. And so I'm beginning to start to have questions about people who - or communities that are absolutely certain about things.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, Laurence Rees, thanks so much for speaking with us.\\n\\nREES: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" After a break, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: Today we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Next, we'll hear Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016 at the age of 87. Wiesel was born in what was then Romania and was 15 when he and his family were sent from Hungary to Auschwitz in 1944. He was later moved to another camp, Buchenwald, from which he was liberated in 1945. Among his family, only two of his sisters survived the war.\\n\\nWiesel became one of the first survivors to devote his life to bearing witness to the Holocaust. His memoir, \\\"Night,\\\" was published in English in 1960, and he spent the rest of his life speaking about social injustice. Terry spoke with him in 1988 when his novel \\\"Twilight\\\" was published.\\n\\nTERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Why have you made it your life work to bear witness?\\n\\nELIE WIESEL: What else could one do, having gone through certain events? I believe a human being, if he or she wants to remain human, then he or she must do something with what we have seen, endured, witnessed. Not to live through an experience, but the experience is there - it's bad, but not to communicate it is worse.\\n\\nGROSS: You know, I think that it's almost a human instinct to let time dim memories of horror and tragedy. Have you fought that in a way? Have you tried to keep those memories alive so that you can continue to communicate about them?\\n\\nWIESEL: Naturally. I mean, naturally, the human being wants to forget pain. In this case, although, for most of those who went through the experience during the war, they want to remember more and more and more. They go deep into their own consciousness, into their own memory, trying to find more events, more faces, more eyes, more words, more sighs, more tears, more agonies. It's never enough because we feel that we have to tell the story, and no one can tell the story fully.\\n\\nGROSS: You once described Auschwitz as the defeat of the intellect that wants to find a meaning, with a capital M, in history. Do you feel that, nevertheless, you've been really spending your life trying to find some meaning of the Holocaust, some larger meaning you could tell us about man or about God?\\n\\nWIESEL: I'll tell you, all the questions I had remain open. I really don't believe that I found any answer to any one of the questions I had. I don't know the meaning. I don't know why it happened. I don't know how it happened. I still don't know anything, really. I'm trying to tell a story, and even the story cannot be told. And therefore, it cannot be communicated, and therefore, people - and deep down, I know - won't receive the testimony that we are giving. We are a very special kind of writers, those who write about that event. And I write very little about it, really. But I know that people cannot understand.\\n\\nGROSS: I think when you were in the camps, you saw some religious people stop praying and saw people who had not been observant turn to God. You had been very observant and very immersed in the religious texts when you were young, before you were deported to the concentration camps. How did your experiences and your survival in the camps change your own experience of religion?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, the change - to the extent that it occurred - did not occur there. It's afterwards that the problems became urgent. Inside that universe, we continued praying. We continued believing. We continued affirming. We needed that link with our past. It's only after the war that I began asking questions, and I began articulating a certain protest. And that protest is still with me. I am still angry at all the forces in history that provoked such a catastrophe. That doesn't mean that my faith left me or that I left fate. I try to develop a certain protest within fate.\\n\\nGROSS: Have you gone back to the religious texts that you were reading when you were young?\\n\\nWIESEL: I never stopped reading or studying. Even inside that universe, I studied. I had a teacher there with name I never knew and whose face I hardly saw. But he was a teacher, the head of a Talmudic school in Galicia. And we work together, and we studied together. I know. It's incredible.\\n\\nGROSS: This is in the camps.\\n\\nWIESEL: Inside - in Auschwitz. So we studied. They kept on studying from morning to evening. And after the war, the first thing I wanted was a book, was a Talmudic treatise. I never stopped studying. That probably saved me.\\n\\nGROSS: In your first novel, \\\"Night...\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: \\\"Night\\\" was not a novel. It was a memoir.\\n\\nGROSS: I don't know why I think of it as a novel.\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Every word...\\n\\nGROSS: I think of think of it as a very autobiographical novel, but...\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah. Well, I - then I guess I was going to ask you about your religious teacher who narrowly escaped from being murdered with hundreds or thousands of other Jews in the forest by the SS. And he somehow managed to escape and come back to your village to warn people about what was happening, and no one would listen.\\n\\nWIESEL: We didn't listen because he was a simple man. He was a beetle. Had he been an important person, I think some people would have listened. What is so extraordinary is when we remember today the silence, the indifference of so many people who were not inside the tragedy but on the other side, just imagine if we had heard on the radio Ben-Gurion from Israel or Roosevelt or Churchill telling Hungarian Jews don't go because they are killing. They're massacring. I think they would have believed them. But why should one believe a beetle, a man who came back from the other side and was telling such atrocious stories?\\n\\nGROSS: We're getting back to the question of madness. I think a lot of people in your village just assumed he'd lost his mind and was making up - you know, was having visions or something, that this couldn't possibly have happened.\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, absolutely. I myself - I was very close to him. And we spent many, many hours alone together every evening. And I would listen to him. Plus, I love to listen to stories, even to his stories, maybe especially to hear stories. But I didn't believe them.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel recorded in 1988. Wiesel died in 2016.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you do anything to mentally prepare for what was in store when your father told you that the next day the whole village was going to be deported, the whole ghetto was going to be deported?\\n\\nWIESEL: No. We didn't know. See; Hungarian Jewry was deported at such a pace. Everything came so fast. The Hungarians allowed the Germans to come in in March. The end of May, all the Jews were out already in Germany. In less than six weeks, Eichmann had managed to deport to their death more than 600,000 Jews - men, women and children. So it came very fast. And it ended very fast. We didn't have time to think.\\n\\nGROSS: You've described yourself as having been very weak and sickly when you were young. I know you think of yourself as having survived purely by chance. Did you learn things, though, to help you survive when you were in the camps?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Not at all. I was the wrong person, the wrong candidate for survival. I was always weak, as you said, and disarmed, cowardly. I would never try to do anything, which was not what I could have done or should have done. I never asked for a supplement of anything. I didn't volunteer. I was always pleased to think that I could be invisible. Not to make myself visible was my task. I don't know why I survived. I don't know how I survived. It was really by accident.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you know when you got out of the camps that you wanted to write?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, I knew that I was going to write before I entered the camps. I come from a tradition, from the Jewish tradition, we believe - which believes in words, in language, in communication. And already at the age of 12 or 13, I was writing. Of course, it wasn't good. It meant nothing, but I tried to write. I even found the manuscript. I went back to my hometown. It's not good. But I tried.\\n\\nAfterwards, I knew I would have to bear witness. Everyone who was there is a witness, and everyone who was there is a true witness. Others who are trying to speak about this subject occasionally are false witnesses. And I felt that I had to be a true witness. And therefore, I decided to wait for 10 years, not to speak about it but to use language related to these experiences until I knew that the words were true words.\\n\\nGROSS: Why 10 years? Why not five years? Why not one year? No, seriously. What made you think..\\n\\nGROSS: ...That 10 years is what you needed to really know what it was you wanted to say and what words you wanted to say it with?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, 10 is a biblical figure, I know. And the - it's a good figure, why not? I cannot tell you that I got up one morning and decided that - let's see, that five or six or seven. It entered my mind - it has to be 10. I decided 10.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you actually have an anniversary where like...\\n\\nGROSS: And that day you sat down to write.\\n\\nGROSS: And is that when you started to write \\\"Night?\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" yes. That's when I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" on April 11, 1955, which is 10 years later.\\n\\nGROSS: And looking back, do you think that this was definitely the right thing to do, to wait those 10 years? In what ways were you changed as a witness and as a writer during those 10 years?\\n\\nWIESEL: Maybe I didn't change, but the words in me changed. They grew. you know, Words have strange destiny, too. They grow, they get old, they die, they come back. Words can be turned into spears. They can be turned into prayers. It's a strange world that you are in when you deal with words.\\n\\nGROSS: In one of your essays, you wrote that after the war, you deliberately avoided all contact with Germans and that their presence sickened you physically. Did that change? And if so, what changed that?\\n\\nWIESEL: It did. But I didn't want to go back to Germany, really. I went once because I didn't want to judge people. I went once in the early '60s to do a piece for commentary. And I realized that every person I see in the street, I judge him or her asking, where was he, what did he do, how old is he, could I - could he have been there? And I didn't want that role, so I didn't go back. But I did go back last year in '86, '87.\\n\\nToday, you have a young generation of Germans. And I do not believe in collective guilt. So I have absolutely no problem with the young Germans. I even feel sorry for the young Germans because to be maybe sons or daughters of killers is different than to be sons and daughters of the victims. And I felt sorry for them. I still do.\\n\\nGROSS: The generations of survivors are getting older. The older generation of survivors is no longer with us. Are you concerned about what's going to happen after the generations of survivors pass on, like, who will be around to actually speak the memories?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, I'm profoundly concerned, naturally. In one of my novels, I try to describe that feeling of the last survivor, what it means to be the very last. And I would not want to be that last survivor. But on the other hand, we are leaving a legacy. We are bequeathing a certain message, a certain story. This tragedy is the most documented tragedy in recorded history. And therefore later on, if there will be a later on, anyone wishing to know will know where to go for knowledge.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988.

I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Monday, January 27, is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Today we're going to listen to two interviews. In a bit, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016. But first, we'll listen to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, the site of history's largest mass murder, as well as insights into Hitler's campaign of genocide against the Jews of Europe.\\n\\nRees' book is based on more than a hundred interviews with Auschwitz survivors and Nazi perpetrators, many of whom spoke on the record for the first time. He believes his search for the truth was aided by the fact that surviving Nazis had reached an age where candor no longer jeopardized careers and by the fall of communism, which opened up a wealth of new archival material. His book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nLAURENCE REES: Thank you very much.\\n\\nDAVIES: You note early in this book that you were one of relatively few people who've been able to interview quite a number of war criminals from three of the great totalitarian powers of the 20th century - that is, Stalinist Russia, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. And you say in this book that having done so, you can confirm that Nazi war criminals that you met were different from the other two.\\n\\nDAVIES: How were they different?\\n\\nREES: They're different in a kind of paradoxical way because when I grew up at school and first heard about the Nazis and - the whole line that was taken then in the '70s was that Nazi war criminals would give us the standard defense. Oh, I was only - I was acting under orders. I was acting under orders. And so that was kind of what you imagine, when you meet people like this, they're going to say. Well, paradoxically, that was the kind of response I got from Stalin's secret policemen, from members of the Imperial Army who committed terrible crimes in China and in the Pacific War. That was what they were saying. I didn't tend to get that from Nazi war criminals. The frightening thing to me - particularly frightening - was that most of the Nazi war criminals I've met actually, when you push them, say, well - and you say, well, why were you doing this - don't say, I was acting on your orders. Say, well, at the time, I thought what I was doing was right.\\n\\nDAVIES: And what do you attribute that to? I mean, they seemed to be true believers in the cause.\\n\\nREES: I think it's a variety of things that, in the end, for me, mean that Nazism is more horrible but more interesting as a phenomenon. I think it's to do with the fact that, certainly, if you were a secret policeman in Stalin's Russia, I think for the most part, the terror was so ubiquitous that no one was safe from the knock at the door. No one could really understand exactly why individuals were sometimes being targeted. Stalin famously had one of his own Politburo, Molotov's wife, tortured. I've talked to people who were at meetings where they stood up and were denouncing other people as enemies of the state because they were worried they'd be denounced. There didn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to some of this. So this means that the only way of making sense of it, really, for a lot of these people doing the bad things was to say, well, you know, I was doing it because I'm ordered to do it.\\n\\nSimilarly, in Imperial Japan, the level of training - the brutality of the training of Japanese soldiers, I think, is without parallel in the modern world, what these people were put through in training - bullying, the vicious beatings and so on, the indoctrination as well. But it was such that if you didn't - you know, you obeyed, and you obeyed blindly, I think, in a number of cases.\\n\\nWhat's going on in Germany is rather different. What's going on in Germany is that - I think to some extent thanks to the work of Goebbels, who - again, a horrible, nasty person, but the genius of propaganda of the 20th century. Thanks to the work of Goebbels, but also thanks to the fact that there was a genuine feeling of injustice in Germany after the end of the First World War. There was a feeling put about that Jews were to blame. There was a feeling of fear of communism, that Jews were somehow falsely attributed in their totality to communism. Simultaneously, Jews were thought to be running Roosevelt in American politics, anti-German and so on. So there were a whole series of what they took to be, at the time, pragmatic, positive reasons to do what they were doing, and that's one of the frightening things about it.\\n\\nDAVIES: When the Nazis spoke of achieving the Final Solution to the Jewish problem in the early years of the war, is it clear they meant extermination of the Jews?\\n\\nREES: No, they didn't mean extermination, I don't believe. It's clear that the words Final Solution change in meaning, I believe, during 1941. When Heydrich is charged by Goring with organizing the Final Solution to the Jewish problem, initially, the order explicitly states evacuation. And that was the overt policy, certainly, since 1938 and the Anschluss with Austria. When the German troops go into Austria, they, under Eichmann of the SS of - you know, later absolutely infamous for being one of the organizers of the murders in the Final Solution - he organizes a system of expropriation, of robbing, of treating violently the Jews of Vienna, robbing them and then those who can almost pay to go, expelling them.\\n\\nI think that what's clear is that Hitler always hated the Jews. He always loathed the Jews. He always wanted rid of the Jews in one way or another. The form that that wanting rid of would take varied at different points. The Final Solution, therefore, varied, I think, at different points. And certainly, at the beginning of the war, the Final Solution, I think, to the Jewish problem is one as they see it. I mean, horrible to use this language. It's not a problem. It's the problem of their mentality. But as they described it, the Jewish problem - the way to, quote, \\\"solve,\\\" unquote, this was by evacuation.\\n\\nDAVIES: It's remarkable that you find places where people talk about the notion of mass killings as being uncivilized and un-German.\\n\\nREES: Yes, that's right. Both Heydrich and Himmler say that in the - 1940. And so we know, I think, beyond reasonable doubt that the Final Solution does not mean extermination because in - actually on paper, Himmler and Heydrich are talking about extermination as being uncivilized when later on openly, at his speech at Poznan in 1943, Himmler is talking about physical extermination. Something changes.\\n\\nAnd again, we know that from the documents that - and from eyewitness testimony that in the summer of 1940, they had this - what it seems now at this distance - utterly outlandish, insane plan to transport Jews to Madagascar, the island of Madagascar of Africa. What they anticipated, the Nazis, was that the war was going to end in 1940. Britain would make peace, and they had - would have the French colonies at their disposal, including Madagascar. And the Jews would be able in French ships probably to be shipped there, which is why they were herded into ghettos. Ghettos were only ever seen as a temporary measure prior to expulsion.\\n\\nBut again, as you see time and again in this terrible history, things don't go the way the Nazis want. They're constantly - really, they're always constantly thinking the war's going to end. They keep thinking, any minute now, any moment now, the war's going to stop. We'll have won, and we'll be able to deal with this in this way. And it never does end when they think it's going to end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, the development of this notion of a Final Solution from being the evacuation of Jews to the extermination of Jews you sort of describe as a process of increasing radicalization. Now...\\n\\nDAVIES: What does this mean?\\n\\nREES: So I think one of the best examples of this cumulative radicalization, of the Nazis responding brutally to crises that they themselves have created, occurs in the Lodz ghetto, where what happens is that the Jews have been imprisoned. They've been forced to give up their money to buy food. They've run out of money, so they begin to starve. So then Nazi functionaries face a choice. Some say, let them all starve. Others say, no, no. We need to get something from these people, exploit them. That view prevails. They put them to work in horrible conditions, of course, and they pay them a tiny pittance. But those who are working can actually feed themselves a bit. Other people - the old people, children - are suffering terribly and still starving.\\n\\nAnd actually, one Nazi functionary looks at this situation they themselves have created and can - and writes a note saying, wouldn't it be more humane to kill these people rather than let them starve? So that's an example of how they end up in this position that they themselves have created, where they almost - where someone has the obscenity to write that it's more humane to kill somebody than to leave them to starve.\\n\\nDAVIES: So it's done with this utterly immoral idea of herding people into ghettos with the idea you will transport them out. When you can't transport them out...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...They begin to starve. And one thing leads to another, and then you've come to this utterly horrific conclusion that...\\n\\nREES: Yes. And so what...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...You have to kill people - hundreds of thousands.\\n\\nREES: And also you see - exactly. And what's going on in the minds of a lot of these Nazis - unbelievably, we might think today, rightly - is a sense of annoyance and indignation as - that the Jews have brought this on themselves because the war is still going on, and they can't be expelled.\\n\\nSo I've heard Nazis say - and seen it - that they say, oh, well, of course Churchill is controlled by the Jews. That's why they'd - the British don't do the logical, sensible thing in 1940 and make peace with us.\\n\\nwe're still trapped in this war, and we're in the war as a result of what the Jews are doing. And if the war had gone - if the war had ended, we'd been able to expel the Jews somewhere - where incidentally they would probably have had some form of genocidal horror awaiting them anyway - but they would have been expelled somewhere, and now we can't expel them. What are we supposed to do with them?\\n\\nAnd so this is the kind of mentality that you hear and you see it absolutely plainly now, I think, as a result of a lot of new research around Pearl Harbor, that there are killings going on before Pearl Harbor, notably in Eastern Europe and behind the lines in the war against the Soviet Union. But there's nothing - there is no major death camping operation. But what happens is, as soon as Pearl Harbor happens, you see Hitler's rhetoric change. And he starts talking about, right now it's a world war, and you remember my prophecy of 1939, in which he stated if the Jews succeed in causing a world war, the result will be their annihilation.\\n\\nHe sees this as a fulfillment of a prophecy. He said, if the Jews get involved and cause a world war - America coming into the war is de facto a world war. They simultaneously think the Jews are not just behind Stalin and - but they're behind Roosevelt as well. It's pathological, this stuff. They absolutely believed that I think. And so as a result of that, they absolutely push forward with a massive expansion in the killing around that time, immediately after Pearl Harbor.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to the interview I recorded in 2005 with journalist Laurence Rees, when his book \\\"Auschwitz: A New History\\\" was published.\\n\\nWhen the Nazis first began executing Jews in large numbers, they did it, really, with firing squads. What was the impact of that kind of close-quarter execution on the Germans who carried it out?\\n\\nREES: The impact for quite a substantial proportion of them was terrible. They were emotionally made distraught by this. They're having to shoot women and children at very close range. And this - thus, I believe, begins this journey to the gas chambers that we know of, the infamous gas chambers. And it's because, we see, when Himmler visits Minsk in August 1941, he's told of the emotional problems that the killing in this way, the shooting killings are doing to his men. And he puts in training, as a result, a whole series of experiments to devise a way of killing that is not so emotionally disturbing to his men.\\n\\nI'd always thought that the reason that the gas chambers were devised was primarily to kill people in large numbers. Well, it wasn't just that at all; it was actually so that there was a less emotionally stressful way that the killers could commit murder.\\n\\nDAVIES: They began initially by putting people into a - I guess, in a cabin of some kind and piping exhaust fumes into it.\\n\\nREES: That's right. Well, what happens now again - and we can see this as an example of both cumulative radicalism and competition within the Nazi state - is various people at various different locations come up with different initiatives. What happens is there's an initiative which is the gas van, which is a van where you connect the exhaust back into a compartment hermetically sealed in the rear, where people are gassed. There's the building of the - camp Belzec, which is the first stationary gas chambers, again, using large engines with carbon gases going in to gas them.\\n\\nAnd then at the same time, in September 1941, you find a totally different initiative beginning at Auschwitz, which is the only camp where this initiative begins, which is the use of Zyklon B. Zyklon B is a powerful insecticide using - used for disinfecting rooms. And it was already in Auschwitz, and they used it for delousing prisoners' clothes and rooms because they had a terrible problem with lice because of the inhumane conditions, not least, that prisoners were kept in.\\n\\nAnd one of the functionaries there thinks to himself, well, it's got printed on the Zyklon B cans - dangerous to life; don't go in the room while this is being let off. And he goes, well, actually, of course, if you want to kill people, they should be in the room. So he starts experimenting, not on Jews but on the sick and on Soviet prisoners of war at Auschwitz. And he starts with Zyklon B. The experiments go wrong to start with. They alter doses. They do experiments. And eventually, they evolve a different method of killing to the ones used in the death camps of Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec.\\n\\nDAVIES: Now, as you noted, Auschwitz was not originally conceived of as a death camp, but as a labor camp, which meant that it was large and had lots and lots of barracks. And you note that when the killings of Jews really accelerated in 1942 that this was done not so much at Auschwitz, but at three other camps - at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. And...\\n\\nDAVIES: They were specifically set up as death camps. And you made the point that when visitors go to those sites, they are always shocked at how small they are even though...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...These three camps alone accounted for 1.7 million deaths. Why were these deaths camps so small? How did they function?\\n\\nREES: Because they had no other function than killing. Auschwitz is unique in the history of the Nazi states, unique in the history of the world. It's not just the site of the largest mass murder the world's ever seen as a physical site. It's also unique in the Nazi state in that it's the only camp that combines two functions. It's both a concentration camp and a death camp, and those functions vary at different times in its history.\\n\\nWhat's happening at places like Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor is they are set up in 1942 - all of them open in 1942. They are set up purely to murder Jews. And if you plan on just - just, I say, just - murdering people, one of the shocking things is you need no real space at all. These places are a few hundred yards square - nothing left of them now because the Nazis themselves destroyed these camps in late 1943. They knew that they wanted to keep this their secret. And they were essentially places where trains would arrive, and the Jews would be taken off. And 99 - more than 99% of these people would be dead, probably, within two hours. So there was no stay of any kind, really, at all.\\n\\nA camp like Treblinka, which was capable of killing 300,000 people in little more - in around less than two months in the summer of 1942 - 300,000 people in that one small space - it was run by around 20 Germans and about 100 Ukrainian guards. And these Ukrainians had been mostly selected from prison camps. They had been people fighting on the Russian side who, in the horror of the prison camps that the Germans set up for these Russians where millions died, were offered this chance of saving themselves, to go and work on the German side.\\n\\nAnd then there was the third category of people working in these camps who were, tragically, Jews themselves. The Nazis selected, very occasionally, from incoming transports a number of fit Jewish people and forced them, on pain of their own immediate murder, to participate in the process by cutting people's hair, by showing the way to the gas chamber, by cleaning the gas chambers, by burning the bodies and so on. And the torment that these people went through is scarcely imaginable.\\n\\nDAVIES: So the actual horrific task of murder, of cleaning the bodies, of cleaning out the chambers after the killing has occurred is, by and large, not done by Germans.\\n\\nREES: Never done by Germans, really. No.\\n\\nDAVIES: Yeah. And that was true at Auschwitz as well.\\n\\nREES: So they end up at the huge, industrial-style killing factories of Auschwitz-Birkenau. You have a crematorium gas chamber complex that's capable, in the summer of 1941, of killing 10,000 people in one day - 10,000 people in one day. And it's run by between 2 to 4 Germans and around about 100 Jews. Now, the Nazis save the absolute moment of murder to themselves. They're the ones who drop the canisters of Zyklon B actually into the gas chamber. But pretty much all the other tasks involved in making this operate are run by Jewish Sonderkommando, who we know both from interviewing some - the few people who survived this and also from documents that Jewish Sonderkommando wrote and hid in the foundations of the building often at the time. The torment these people went through was practically indescribable.\\n\\nDAVIES: I was struck by your description of the arrival buildings at the death camps, that they often were fairly pleasant-looking, I mean, with flower plantings and the kind - I guess designed to reinsure the incoming inmates...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...That their fate was not what it was going to be.\\n\\nREES: Again, this is all part of the cynicism, but it's also part of the learning curve that the Nazis go on because what happens at Treblinka, which was the most deadly, if you like, of all of these death camps outside of Auschwitz - they were killing so many people that the system broke down - summer of 1942 - that the system broke down. There were bodies everywhere. There was just mayhem, people being shot. It was chaos.\\n\\nSo they actually had to shut it down and reorganize it. And the new commander of Treblinka, what he managed to do as he pushed it forward was come up with all of these devices like the fake railway station, fake timetables, lovely flowers - same thing happened at Sobibor. One of the most extraordinary individuals I've ever met, Toivi Blatt, who survived Sobibor, said, actually, when he got off there, he'd been expecting some horrible place. He said, it was always beautiful. And as you say, it's all designed so that when, say, Jews coming from Holland arrive, they're told, you are at a transit station, hygiene stop while - we just need to take a shower, have your hair cut and we're going to move on east. And it's deliberately designed to do that.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more from him after a break, and we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. Monday, January 27 is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, based on more than 100 interviews with survivors and Nazi perpetrators. It's called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nDAVIES: You note that Auschwitz became, really, a death camp at a point when the Nazi death machine had become very well-developed, and Nazi initiative and ingenuity had addressed some of the technical difficulties of mass murder and had worked out solutions. Tell us a bit about those arriving Jews who were selected for immediate death. What exactly faced them, and who did the work?\\n\\nREES: Well, they would be taken from the - by the time - in 1944, by the time this became the most sophisticated procedure, they'd be taken straight from the arrival ramp, which was the area they arrived at, directly inside Birkenau. The railway line ran into the camp. They'd be taken, really, a few hundred yards round to one of four combination gas chamber-crematoriums.\\n\\nThey would then be taken down in two - cases of two of them, they'd be taken on - all on ground level. The other two - one had basement, undressing rooms and gas chambers. They'd be taken down or into a room where they'd be told to undress because they were going to have to have a shower as part of the camp's admittance procedure. And they would then be crammed into an airtight room - the door shut, locked behind them.\\n\\nAnd then either from above, in the case of the basement gas chambers or through the windows of the ones all on the ground floor, canisters of Zyklon B would be thrown in. And it would normally - it would take - dependent on how many people were in these gas chambers, dependent on the weather because Zyklon B was more effective the warmer the air was - it would take 15, 20 minutes for these people to die, I think, a horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible death of suffocation and poisoning.\\n\\nThe gas chambers would then be opened. The Sonderkommando, Jewish - other Jewish prisoners with gas masks, would have to go in, would take out the bodies, would - in the case of the adults - go through them and take out the gold teeth, would shave the hair of the women. The bodies would then be pushed into lifts taken up to the first - to the ground level or the basement gas chambers, where the bodies would be burned. And then their ashes would be collected and either thrown in the immediate area or taken down to the nearby river, Vistula. So that was the horror of the process that they devised in the end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Were many of the SS officials who conducted the murder at Auschwitz held accountable for their actions?\\n\\nREES: Well, I think this is one of the great scandals of this story, a story rich in scandal at every level. But this is one of the greater scandals, which is that less than - well, maybe, 12%, 10% of SS people who worked at Auschwitz were ever prosecuted. Around 90% of the SS who worked at Auschwitz during the war escaped all forms of prosecution. And myself, I think that's a scandal.\\n\\nDAVIES: Why was that?\\n\\nREES: One of the reasons that so few people were prosecuted was that by the 1960s, the German prosecutors had taken the view that unless a member of the SS was absolutely directly involved in the killing or had been directly involved in acts of brutality - physical brutality - then they could get off scot-free. And of course, it meant that the way that the gas chambers had been devised, which was that so few Germans were needed for their actual physical operation, it meant that the vast majority of SS at the camp could say, oh, I wasn't really directly involved in the killing at all.\\n\\nNow, myself, I think that's a calamity. That's terrible because, of course, if you're working in the currency units counting out money, if you're working in the SS transport division, if you're a guard at the camp, you are directly involved in the operation of the camp that results - that's an extermination center. So I certainly disagree with - you know, for all the good it's going to do anybody that I disagree, but I certainly disagree that they took that view.\\n\\nDAVIES: In this book, you compare the crimes of the Holocaust to other mass exterminations in history - going as far back as Genghis Khan's genocide in Persia - and conclude that this represents the lowest act in human history and should not be allowed to recede into distant memory as some of these other mass killings have. What's different about this extermination?\\n\\nREES: I think that if you're looking at how you should think about events in the past - or even events in the present, actually - what you've got to do is look at the overall circumstances in which these things happen. You know, it's not much good thinking, well, oh, the Vikings were terrible. Well, the Vikings operated in a system of values at the time that was - they were, by all accounts from latest research on Vikings, for example, scarcely better or worse than any other 10th century marauding hordes. I mean, it's a ludicrous - it seems to me a ludicrous way to go to start blaming Vikings for being Vikings.\\n\\nSomething different is going on here. What's happening is that you are taking a cultured nation at the heart of Europe in the 20th century, long after the Enlightenment, that has adopted absolute civilized cultural values in the wake of the end of the first world war. It is a thriving, although troubled, democracy. Its take - it's got rid of all legislation against Jews. It's liberal in that regard. All of these things are going on. It's got a great written culture. It's got a great musical culture. It's got a great artistic culture. It's the place you would think would be the most civilized almost to be. And yet that very place, within a matter of years, turns into this.\\n\\nSo you've got a journey that they go on that's unlike - and it's not like the journey the Vikings go on or Genghis Khan or the plains goes on. This is not like that. This is a different journey. This is a journey from one pole - one extreme, if you like, to the other extreme. And in the process, they use 20th-century technology that they warp and adapt to this very service of mass killing. And unlike Stalin, who even at his worst, when he was deporting entire nations - the Kalmyk nations, the Crimean Tatars and so on. He's deporting whole nations to Siberia. Even Stalin isn't trying to put forward measures to eliminate them in their entirety. So something different, I think, is going on here.\\n\\nDAVIES: So many students of Nazism and the Holocaust have tried to in some way answer the question, how could this happen? You've interviewed a hundred or so survivors and war criminals from Auschwitz. Do you feel you have some new insights into that question?\\n\\nREES: I think what surprised me about this - because I never intended this career (laughter). Like, this kind of happened to me, you know, that I've been - written so much on this and made so many programs on this. And one of the reasons it's happened is because I keep thinking I'm getting close to being able to answer that properly. And as I - as I keep getting towards it, it keeps going away from me a bit more. So I think I'm a long way down the road, I hope, to being able to get to there. But I'm not there yet. Maybe it's absolutely impossible to get there.\\n\\nBut one thing I took from this was a big fear I've now got about people of absolute faith. I always thought faith of itself was - could only be a positive thing. Everyone talks about the importance of having faith. Well, these guys had faith, absolute faith. And there's one really desperately upsetting - all desperately upsetting. But ideologically, there's one desperately particularly upsetting moment where - in the book where I talk about how Himmler and Hoss most admired, as prisoners, Jehovah's Witnesses. They pointed to them and said, see that faith? That's the kind of faith we need in our fuhrer - absolute, unshakable faith.\\n\\nNow, of course, no one is equating what the Nazis did with Jehovah's Witnesses, who operate a whole creed of peace and love and so on. Absolutely. But the very notion of absolute faith is at the core of this. And so I'm beginning to start to have questions about people who - or communities that are absolutely certain about things.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, Laurence Rees, thanks so much for speaking with us.\\n\\nREES: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" After a break, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: Today we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Next, we'll hear Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016 at the age of 87. Wiesel was born in what was then Romania and was 15 when he and his family were sent from Hungary to Auschwitz in 1944. He was later moved to another camp, Buchenwald, from which he was liberated in 1945. Among his family, only two of his sisters survived the war.\\n\\nWiesel became one of the first survivors to devote his life to bearing witness to the Holocaust. His memoir, \\\"Night,\\\" was published in English in 1960, and he spent the rest of his life speaking about social injustice. Terry spoke with him in 1988 when his novel \\\"Twilight\\\" was published.\\n\\nTERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Why have you made it your life work to bear witness?\\n\\nELIE WIESEL: What else could one do, having gone through certain events? I believe a human being, if he or she wants to remain human, then he or she must do something with what we have seen, endured, witnessed. Not to live through an experience, but the experience is there - it's bad, but not to communicate it is worse.\\n\\nGROSS: You know, I think that it's almost a human instinct to let time dim memories of horror and tragedy. Have you fought that in a way? Have you tried to keep those memories alive so that you can continue to communicate about them?\\n\\nWIESEL: Naturally. I mean, naturally, the human being wants to forget pain. In this case, although, for most of those who went through the experience during the war, they want to remember more and more and more. They go deep into their own consciousness, into their own memory, trying to find more events, more faces, more eyes, more words, more sighs, more tears, more agonies. It's never enough because we feel that we have to tell the story, and no one can tell the story fully.\\n\\nGROSS: You once described Auschwitz as the defeat of the intellect that wants to find a meaning, with a capital M, in history. Do you feel that, nevertheless, you've been really spending your life trying to find some meaning of the Holocaust, some larger meaning you could tell us about man or about God?\\n\\nWIESEL: I'll tell you, all the questions I had remain open. I really don't believe that I found any answer to any one of the questions I had. I don't know the meaning. I don't know why it happened. I don't know how it happened. I still don't know anything, really. I'm trying to tell a story, and even the story cannot be told. And therefore, it cannot be communicated, and therefore, people - and deep down, I know - won't receive the testimony that we are giving. We are a very special kind of writers, those who write about that event. And I write very little about it, really. But I know that people cannot understand.\\n\\nGROSS: I think when you were in the camps, you saw some religious people stop praying and saw people who had not been observant turn to God. You had been very observant and very immersed in the religious texts when you were young, before you were deported to the concentration camps. How did your experiences and your survival in the camps change your own experience of religion?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, the change - to the extent that it occurred - did not occur there. It's afterwards that the problems became urgent. Inside that universe, we continued praying. We continued believing. We continued affirming. We needed that link with our past. It's only after the war that I began asking questions, and I began articulating a certain protest. And that protest is still with me. I am still angry at all the forces in history that provoked such a catastrophe. That doesn't mean that my faith left me or that I left fate. I try to develop a certain protest within fate.\\n\\nGROSS: Have you gone back to the religious texts that you were reading when you were young?\\n\\nWIESEL: I never stopped reading or studying. Even inside that universe, I studied. I had a teacher there with name I never knew and whose face I hardly saw. But he was a teacher, the head of a Talmudic school in Galicia. And we work together, and we studied together. I know. It's incredible.\\n\\nGROSS: This is in the camps.\\n\\nWIESEL: Inside - in Auschwitz. So we studied. They kept on studying from morning to evening. And after the war, the first thing I wanted was a book, was a Talmudic treatise. I never stopped studying. That probably saved me.\\n\\nGROSS: In your first novel, \\\"Night...\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: \\\"Night\\\" was not a novel. It was a memoir.\\n\\nGROSS: I don't know why I think of it as a novel.\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Every word...\\n\\nGROSS: I think of think of it as a very autobiographical novel, but...\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah. Well, I - then I guess I was going to ask you about your religious teacher who narrowly escaped from being murdered with hundreds or thousands of other Jews in the forest by the SS. And he somehow managed to escape and come back to your village to warn people about what was happening, and no one would listen.\\n\\nWIESEL: We didn't listen because he was a simple man. He was a beetle. Had he been an important person, I think some people would have listened. What is so extraordinary is when we remember today the silence, the indifference of so many people who were not inside the tragedy but on the other side, just imagine if we had heard on the radio Ben-Gurion from Israel or Roosevelt or Churchill telling Hungarian Jews don't go because they are killing. They're massacring. I think they would have believed them. But why should one believe a beetle, a man who came back from the other side and was telling such atrocious stories?\\n\\nGROSS: We're getting back to the question of madness. I think a lot of people in your village just assumed he'd lost his mind and was making up - you know, was having visions or something, that this couldn't possibly have happened.\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, absolutely. I myself - I was very close to him. And we spent many, many hours alone together every evening. And I would listen to him. Plus, I love to listen to stories, even to his stories, maybe especially to hear stories. But I didn't believe them.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel recorded in 1988. Wiesel died in 2016.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you do anything to mentally prepare for what was in store when your father told you that the next day the whole village was going to be deported, the whole ghetto was going to be deported?\\n\\nWIESEL: No. We didn't know. See; Hungarian Jewry was deported at such a pace. Everything came so fast. The Hungarians allowed the Germans to come in in March. The end of May, all the Jews were out already in Germany. In less than six weeks, Eichmann had managed to deport to their death more than 600,000 Jews - men, women and children. So it came very fast. And it ended very fast. We didn't have time to think.\\n\\nGROSS: You've described yourself as having been very weak and sickly when you were young. I know you think of yourself as having survived purely by chance. Did you learn things, though, to help you survive when you were in the camps?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Not at all. I was the wrong person, the wrong candidate for survival. I was always weak, as you said, and disarmed, cowardly. I would never try to do anything, which was not what I could have done or should have done. I never asked for a supplement of anything. I didn't volunteer. I was always pleased to think that I could be invisible. Not to make myself visible was my task. I don't know why I survived. I don't know how I survived. It was really by accident.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you know when you got out of the camps that you wanted to write?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, I knew that I was going to write before I entered the camps. I come from a tradition, from the Jewish tradition, we believe - which believes in words, in language, in communication. And already at the age of 12 or 13, I was writing. Of course, it wasn't good. It meant nothing, but I tried to write. I even found the manuscript. I went back to my hometown. It's not good. But I tried.\\n\\nAfterwards, I knew I would have to bear witness. Everyone who was there is a witness, and everyone who was there is a true witness. Others who are trying to speak about this subject occasionally are false witnesses. And I felt that I had to be a true witness. And therefore, I decided to wait for 10 years, not to speak about it but to use language related to these experiences until I knew that the words were true words.\\n\\nGROSS: Why 10 years? Why not five years? Why not one year? No, seriously. What made you think..\\n\\nGROSS: ...That 10 years is what you needed to really know what it was you wanted to say and what words you wanted to say it with?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, 10 is a biblical figure, I know. And the - it's a good figure, why not? I cannot tell you that I got up one morning and decided that - let's see, that five or six or seven. It entered my mind - it has to be 10. I decided 10.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you actually have an anniversary where like...\\n\\nGROSS: And that day you sat down to write.\\n\\nGROSS: And is that when you started to write \\\"Night?\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" yes. That's when I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" on April 11, 1955, which is 10 years later.\\n\\nGROSS: And looking back, do you think that this was definitely the right thing to do, to wait those 10 years? In what ways were you changed as a witness and as a writer during those 10 years?\\n\\nWIESEL: Maybe I didn't change, but the words in me changed. They grew. you know, Words have strange destiny, too. They grow, they get old, they die, they come back. Words can be turned into spears. They can be turned into prayers. It's a strange world that you are in when you deal with words.\\n\\nGROSS: In one of your essays, you wrote that after the war, you deliberately avoided all contact with Germans and that their presence sickened you physically. Did that change? And if so, what changed that?\\n\\nWIESEL: It did. But I didn't want to go back to Germany, really. I went once because I didn't want to judge people. I went once in the early '60s to do a piece for commentary. And I realized that every person I see in the street, I judge him or her asking, where was he, what did he do, how old is he, could I - could he have been there? And I didn't want that role, so I didn't go back. But I did go back last year in '86, '87.\\n\\nToday, you have a young generation of Germans. And I do not believe in collective guilt. So I have absolutely no problem with the young Germans. I even feel sorry for the young Germans because to be maybe sons or daughters of killers is different than to be sons and daughters of the victims. And I felt sorry for them. I still do.\\n\\nGROSS: The generations of survivors are getting older. The older generation of survivors is no longer with us. Are you concerned about what's going to happen after the generations of survivors pass on, like, who will be around to actually speak the memories?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, I'm profoundly concerned, naturally. In one of my novels, I try to describe that feeling of the last survivor, what it means to be the very last. And I would not want to be that last survivor. But on the other hand, we are leaving a legacy. We are bequeathing a certain message, a certain story. This tragedy is the most documented tragedy in recorded history. And therefore later on, if there will be a later on, anyone wishing to know will know where to go for knowledge.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988.

I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Monday, January 27, is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Today we're going to listen to two interviews. In a bit, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016. But first, we'll listen to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, the site of history's largest mass murder, as well as insights into Hitler's campaign of genocide against the Jews of Europe.\\n\\nRees' book is based on more than a hundred interviews with Auschwitz survivors and Nazi perpetrators, many of whom spoke on the record for the first time. He believes his search for the truth was aided by the fact that surviving Nazis had reached an age where candor no longer jeopardized careers and by the fall of communism, which opened up a wealth of new archival material. His book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nLAURENCE REES: Thank you very much.\\n\\nDAVIES: You note early in this book that you were one of relatively few people who've been able to interview quite a number of war criminals from three of the great totalitarian powers of the 20th century - that is, Stalinist Russia, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. And you say in this book that having done so, you can confirm that Nazi war criminals that you met were different from the other two.\\n\\nDAVIES: How were they different?\\n\\nREES: They're different in a kind of paradoxical way because when I grew up at school and first heard about the Nazis and - the whole line that was taken then in the '70s was that Nazi war criminals would give us the standard defense. Oh, I was only - I was acting under orders. I was acting under orders. And so that was kind of what you imagine, when you meet people like this, they're going to say. Well, paradoxically, that was the kind of response I got from Stalin's secret policemen, from members of the Imperial Army who committed terrible crimes in China and in the Pacific War. That was what they were saying. I didn't tend to get that from Nazi war criminals. The frightening thing to me - particularly frightening - was that most of the Nazi war criminals I've met actually, when you push them, say, well - and you say, well, why were you doing this - don't say, I was acting on your orders. Say, well, at the time, I thought what I was doing was right.\\n\\nDAVIES: And what do you attribute that to? I mean, they seemed to be true believers in the cause.\\n\\nREES: I think it's a variety of things that, in the end, for me, mean that Nazism is more horrible but more interesting as a phenomenon. I think it's to do with the fact that, certainly, if you were a secret policeman in Stalin's Russia, I think for the most part, the terror was so ubiquitous that no one was safe from the knock at the door. No one could really understand exactly why individuals were sometimes being targeted. Stalin famously had one of his own Politburo, Molotov's wife, tortured. I've talked to people who were at meetings where they stood up and were denouncing other people as enemies of the state because they were worried they'd be denounced. There didn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to some of this. So this means that the only way of making sense of it, really, for a lot of these people doing the bad things was to say, well, you know, I was doing it because I'm ordered to do it.\\n\\nSimilarly, in Imperial Japan, the level of training - the brutality of the training of Japanese soldiers, I think, is without parallel in the modern world, what these people were put through in training - bullying, the vicious beatings and so on, the indoctrination as well. But it was such that if you didn't - you know, you obeyed, and you obeyed blindly, I think, in a number of cases.\\n\\nWhat's going on in Germany is rather different. What's going on in Germany is that - I think to some extent thanks to the work of Goebbels, who - again, a horrible, nasty person, but the genius of propaganda of the 20th century. Thanks to the work of Goebbels, but also thanks to the fact that there was a genuine feeling of injustice in Germany after the end of the First World War. There was a feeling put about that Jews were to blame. There was a feeling of fear of communism, that Jews were somehow falsely attributed in their totality to communism. Simultaneously, Jews were thought to be running Roosevelt in American politics, anti-German and so on. So there were a whole series of what they took to be, at the time, pragmatic, positive reasons to do what they were doing, and that's one of the frightening things about it.\\n\\nDAVIES: When the Nazis spoke of achieving the Final Solution to the Jewish problem in the early years of the war, is it clear they meant extermination of the Jews?\\n\\nREES: No, they didn't mean extermination, I don't believe. It's clear that the words Final Solution change in meaning, I believe, during 1941. When Heydrich is charged by Goring with organizing the Final Solution to the Jewish problem, initially, the order explicitly states evacuation. And that was the overt policy, certainly, since 1938 and the Anschluss with Austria. When the German troops go into Austria, they, under Eichmann of the SS of - you know, later absolutely infamous for being one of the organizers of the murders in the Final Solution - he organizes a system of expropriation, of robbing, of treating violently the Jews of Vienna, robbing them and then those who can almost pay to go, expelling them.\\n\\nI think that what's clear is that Hitler always hated the Jews. He always loathed the Jews. He always wanted rid of the Jews in one way or another. The form that that wanting rid of would take varied at different points. The Final Solution, therefore, varied, I think, at different points. And certainly, at the beginning of the war, the Final Solution, I think, to the Jewish problem is one as they see it. I mean, horrible to use this language. It's not a problem. It's the problem of their mentality. But as they described it, the Jewish problem - the way to, quote, \\\"solve,\\\" unquote, this was by evacuation.\\n\\nDAVIES: It's remarkable that you find places where people talk about the notion of mass killings as being uncivilized and un-German.\\n\\nREES: Yes, that's right. Both Heydrich and Himmler say that in the - 1940. And so we know, I think, beyond reasonable doubt that the Final Solution does not mean extermination because in - actually on paper, Himmler and Heydrich are talking about extermination as being uncivilized when later on openly, at his speech at Poznan in 1943, Himmler is talking about physical extermination. Something changes.\\n\\nAnd again, we know that from the documents that - and from eyewitness testimony that in the summer of 1940, they had this - what it seems now at this distance - utterly outlandish, insane plan to transport Jews to Madagascar, the island of Madagascar of Africa. What they anticipated, the Nazis, was that the war was going to end in 1940. Britain would make peace, and they had - would have the French colonies at their disposal, including Madagascar. And the Jews would be able in French ships probably to be shipped there, which is why they were herded into ghettos. Ghettos were only ever seen as a temporary measure prior to expulsion.\\n\\nBut again, as you see time and again in this terrible history, things don't go the way the Nazis want. They're constantly - really, they're always constantly thinking the war's going to end. They keep thinking, any minute now, any moment now, the war's going to stop. We'll have won, and we'll be able to deal with this in this way. And it never does end when they think it's going to end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, the development of this notion of a Final Solution from being the evacuation of Jews to the extermination of Jews you sort of describe as a process of increasing radicalization. Now...\\n\\nDAVIES: What does this mean?\\n\\nREES: So I think one of the best examples of this cumulative radicalization, of the Nazis responding brutally to crises that they themselves have created, occurs in the Lodz ghetto, where what happens is that the Jews have been imprisoned. They've been forced to give up their money to buy food. They've run out of money, so they begin to starve. So then Nazi functionaries face a choice. Some say, let them all starve. Others say, no, no. We need to get something from these people, exploit them. That view prevails. They put them to work in horrible conditions, of course, and they pay them a tiny pittance. But those who are working can actually feed themselves a bit. Other people - the old people, children - are suffering terribly and still starving.\\n\\nAnd actually, one Nazi functionary looks at this situation they themselves have created and can - and writes a note saying, wouldn't it be more humane to kill these people rather than let them starve? So that's an example of how they end up in this position that they themselves have created, where they almost - where someone has the obscenity to write that it's more humane to kill somebody than to leave them to starve.\\n\\nDAVIES: So it's done with this utterly immoral idea of herding people into ghettos with the idea you will transport them out. When you can't transport them out...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...They begin to starve. And one thing leads to another, and then you've come to this utterly horrific conclusion that...\\n\\nREES: Yes. And so what...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...You have to kill people - hundreds of thousands.\\n\\nREES: And also you see - exactly. And what's going on in the minds of a lot of these Nazis - unbelievably, we might think today, rightly - is a sense of annoyance and indignation as - that the Jews have brought this on themselves because the war is still going on, and they can't be expelled.\\n\\nSo I've heard Nazis say - and seen it - that they say, oh, well, of course Churchill is controlled by the Jews. That's why they'd - the British don't do the logical, sensible thing in 1940 and make peace with us.\\n\\nwe're still trapped in this war, and we're in the war as a result of what the Jews are doing. And if the war had gone - if the war had ended, we'd been able to expel the Jews somewhere - where incidentally they would probably have had some form of genocidal horror awaiting them anyway - but they would have been expelled somewhere, and now we can't expel them. What are we supposed to do with them?\\n\\nAnd so this is the kind of mentality that you hear and you see it absolutely plainly now, I think, as a result of a lot of new research around Pearl Harbor, that there are killings going on before Pearl Harbor, notably in Eastern Europe and behind the lines in the war against the Soviet Union. But there's nothing - there is no major death camping operation. But what happens is, as soon as Pearl Harbor happens, you see Hitler's rhetoric change. And he starts talking about, right now it's a world war, and you remember my prophecy of 1939, in which he stated if the Jews succeed in causing a world war, the result will be their annihilation.\\n\\nHe sees this as a fulfillment of a prophecy. He said, if the Jews get involved and cause a world war - America coming into the war is de facto a world war. They simultaneously think the Jews are not just behind Stalin and - but they're behind Roosevelt as well. It's pathological, this stuff. They absolutely believed that I think. And so as a result of that, they absolutely push forward with a massive expansion in the killing around that time, immediately after Pearl Harbor.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to the interview I recorded in 2005 with journalist Laurence Rees, when his book \\\"Auschwitz: A New History\\\" was published.\\n\\nWhen the Nazis first began executing Jews in large numbers, they did it, really, with firing squads. What was the impact of that kind of close-quarter execution on the Germans who carried it out?\\n\\nREES: The impact for quite a substantial proportion of them was terrible. They were emotionally made distraught by this. They're having to shoot women and children at very close range. And this - thus, I believe, begins this journey to the gas chambers that we know of, the infamous gas chambers. And it's because, we see, when Himmler visits Minsk in August 1941, he's told of the emotional problems that the killing in this way, the shooting killings are doing to his men. And he puts in training, as a result, a whole series of experiments to devise a way of killing that is not so emotionally disturbing to his men.\\n\\nI'd always thought that the reason that the gas chambers were devised was primarily to kill people in large numbers. Well, it wasn't just that at all; it was actually so that there was a less emotionally stressful way that the killers could commit murder.\\n\\nDAVIES: They began initially by putting people into a - I guess, in a cabin of some kind and piping exhaust fumes into it.\\n\\nREES: That's right. Well, what happens now again - and we can see this as an example of both cumulative radicalism and competition within the Nazi state - is various people at various different locations come up with different initiatives. What happens is there's an initiative which is the gas van, which is a van where you connect the exhaust back into a compartment hermetically sealed in the rear, where people are gassed. There's the building of the - camp Belzec, which is the first stationary gas chambers, again, using large engines with carbon gases going in to gas them.\\n\\nAnd then at the same time, in September 1941, you find a totally different initiative beginning at Auschwitz, which is the only camp where this initiative begins, which is the use of Zyklon B. Zyklon B is a powerful insecticide using - used for disinfecting rooms. And it was already in Auschwitz, and they used it for delousing prisoners' clothes and rooms because they had a terrible problem with lice because of the inhumane conditions, not least, that prisoners were kept in.\\n\\nAnd one of the functionaries there thinks to himself, well, it's got printed on the Zyklon B cans - dangerous to life; don't go in the room while this is being let off. And he goes, well, actually, of course, if you want to kill people, they should be in the room. So he starts experimenting, not on Jews but on the sick and on Soviet prisoners of war at Auschwitz. And he starts with Zyklon B. The experiments go wrong to start with. They alter doses. They do experiments. And eventually, they evolve a different method of killing to the ones used in the death camps of Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec.\\n\\nDAVIES: Now, as you noted, Auschwitz was not originally conceived of as a death camp, but as a labor camp, which meant that it was large and had lots and lots of barracks. And you note that when the killings of Jews really accelerated in 1942 that this was done not so much at Auschwitz, but at three other camps - at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. And...\\n\\nDAVIES: They were specifically set up as death camps. And you made the point that when visitors go to those sites, they are always shocked at how small they are even though...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...These three camps alone accounted for 1.7 million deaths. Why were these deaths camps so small? How did they function?\\n\\nREES: Because they had no other function than killing. Auschwitz is unique in the history of the Nazi states, unique in the history of the world. It's not just the site of the largest mass murder the world's ever seen as a physical site. It's also unique in the Nazi state in that it's the only camp that combines two functions. It's both a concentration camp and a death camp, and those functions vary at different times in its history.\\n\\nWhat's happening at places like Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor is they are set up in 1942 - all of them open in 1942. They are set up purely to murder Jews. And if you plan on just - just, I say, just - murdering people, one of the shocking things is you need no real space at all. These places are a few hundred yards square - nothing left of them now because the Nazis themselves destroyed these camps in late 1943. They knew that they wanted to keep this their secret. And they were essentially places where trains would arrive, and the Jews would be taken off. And 99 - more than 99% of these people would be dead, probably, within two hours. So there was no stay of any kind, really, at all.\\n\\nA camp like Treblinka, which was capable of killing 300,000 people in little more - in around less than two months in the summer of 1942 - 300,000 people in that one small space - it was run by around 20 Germans and about 100 Ukrainian guards. And these Ukrainians had been mostly selected from prison camps. They had been people fighting on the Russian side who, in the horror of the prison camps that the Germans set up for these Russians where millions died, were offered this chance of saving themselves, to go and work on the German side.\\n\\nAnd then there was the third category of people working in these camps who were, tragically, Jews themselves. The Nazis selected, very occasionally, from incoming transports a number of fit Jewish people and forced them, on pain of their own immediate murder, to participate in the process by cutting people's hair, by showing the way to the gas chamber, by cleaning the gas chambers, by burning the bodies and so on. And the torment that these people went through is scarcely imaginable.\\n\\nDAVIES: So the actual horrific task of murder, of cleaning the bodies, of cleaning out the chambers after the killing has occurred is, by and large, not done by Germans.\\n\\nREES: Never done by Germans, really. No.\\n\\nDAVIES: Yeah. And that was true at Auschwitz as well.\\n\\nREES: So they end up at the huge, industrial-style killing factories of Auschwitz-Birkenau. You have a crematorium gas chamber complex that's capable, in the summer of 1941, of killing 10,000 people in one day - 10,000 people in one day. And it's run by between 2 to 4 Germans and around about 100 Jews. Now, the Nazis save the absolute moment of murder to themselves. They're the ones who drop the canisters of Zyklon B actually into the gas chamber. But pretty much all the other tasks involved in making this operate are run by Jewish Sonderkommando, who we know both from interviewing some - the few people who survived this and also from documents that Jewish Sonderkommando wrote and hid in the foundations of the building often at the time. The torment these people went through was practically indescribable.\\n\\nDAVIES: I was struck by your description of the arrival buildings at the death camps, that they often were fairly pleasant-looking, I mean, with flower plantings and the kind - I guess designed to reinsure the incoming inmates...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...That their fate was not what it was going to be.\\n\\nREES: Again, this is all part of the cynicism, but it's also part of the learning curve that the Nazis go on because what happens at Treblinka, which was the most deadly, if you like, of all of these death camps outside of Auschwitz - they were killing so many people that the system broke down - summer of 1942 - that the system broke down. There were bodies everywhere. There was just mayhem, people being shot. It was chaos.\\n\\nSo they actually had to shut it down and reorganize it. And the new commander of Treblinka, what he managed to do as he pushed it forward was come up with all of these devices like the fake railway station, fake timetables, lovely flowers - same thing happened at Sobibor. One of the most extraordinary individuals I've ever met, Toivi Blatt, who survived Sobibor, said, actually, when he got off there, he'd been expecting some horrible place. He said, it was always beautiful. And as you say, it's all designed so that when, say, Jews coming from Holland arrive, they're told, you are at a transit station, hygiene stop while - we just need to take a shower, have your hair cut and we're going to move on east. And it's deliberately designed to do that.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more from him after a break, and we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. Monday, January 27 is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, based on more than 100 interviews with survivors and Nazi perpetrators. It's called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nDAVIES: You note that Auschwitz became, really, a death camp at a point when the Nazi death machine had become very well-developed, and Nazi initiative and ingenuity had addressed some of the technical difficulties of mass murder and had worked out solutions. Tell us a bit about those arriving Jews who were selected for immediate death. What exactly faced them, and who did the work?\\n\\nREES: Well, they would be taken from the - by the time - in 1944, by the time this became the most sophisticated procedure, they'd be taken straight from the arrival ramp, which was the area they arrived at, directly inside Birkenau. The railway line ran into the camp. They'd be taken, really, a few hundred yards round to one of four combination gas chamber-crematoriums.\\n\\nThey would then be taken down in two - cases of two of them, they'd be taken on - all on ground level. The other two - one had basement, undressing rooms and gas chambers. They'd be taken down or into a room where they'd be told to undress because they were going to have to have a shower as part of the camp's admittance procedure. And they would then be crammed into an airtight room - the door shut, locked behind them.\\n\\nAnd then either from above, in the case of the basement gas chambers or through the windows of the ones all on the ground floor, canisters of Zyklon B would be thrown in. And it would normally - it would take - dependent on how many people were in these gas chambers, dependent on the weather because Zyklon B was more effective the warmer the air was - it would take 15, 20 minutes for these people to die, I think, a horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible death of suffocation and poisoning.\\n\\nThe gas chambers would then be opened. The Sonderkommando, Jewish - other Jewish prisoners with gas masks, would have to go in, would take out the bodies, would - in the case of the adults - go through them and take out the gold teeth, would shave the hair of the women. The bodies would then be pushed into lifts taken up to the first - to the ground level or the basement gas chambers, where the bodies would be burned. And then their ashes would be collected and either thrown in the immediate area or taken down to the nearby river, Vistula. So that was the horror of the process that they devised in the end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Were many of the SS officials who conducted the murder at Auschwitz held accountable for their actions?\\n\\nREES: Well, I think this is one of the great scandals of this story, a story rich in scandal at every level. But this is one of the greater scandals, which is that less than - well, maybe, 12%, 10% of SS people who worked at Auschwitz were ever prosecuted. Around 90% of the SS who worked at Auschwitz during the war escaped all forms of prosecution. And myself, I think that's a scandal.\\n\\nDAVIES: Why was that?\\n\\nREES: One of the reasons that so few people were prosecuted was that by the 1960s, the German prosecutors had taken the view that unless a member of the SS was absolutely directly involved in the killing or had been directly involved in acts of brutality - physical brutality - then they could get off scot-free. And of course, it meant that the way that the gas chambers had been devised, which was that so few Germans were needed for their actual physical operation, it meant that the vast majority of SS at the camp could say, oh, I wasn't really directly involved in the killing at all.\\n\\nNow, myself, I think that's a calamity. That's terrible because, of course, if you're working in the currency units counting out money, if you're working in the SS transport division, if you're a guard at the camp, you are directly involved in the operation of the camp that results - that's an extermination center. So I certainly disagree with - you know, for all the good it's going to do anybody that I disagree, but I certainly disagree that they took that view.\\n\\nDAVIES: In this book, you compare the crimes of the Holocaust to other mass exterminations in history - going as far back as Genghis Khan's genocide in Persia - and conclude that this represents the lowest act in human history and should not be allowed to recede into distant memory as some of these other mass killings have. What's different about this extermination?\\n\\nREES: I think that if you're looking at how you should think about events in the past - or even events in the present, actually - what you've got to do is look at the overall circumstances in which these things happen. You know, it's not much good thinking, well, oh, the Vikings were terrible. Well, the Vikings operated in a system of values at the time that was - they were, by all accounts from latest research on Vikings, for example, scarcely better or worse than any other 10th century marauding hordes. I mean, it's a ludicrous - it seems to me a ludicrous way to go to start blaming Vikings for being Vikings.\\n\\nSomething different is going on here. What's happening is that you are taking a cultured nation at the heart of Europe in the 20th century, long after the Enlightenment, that has adopted absolute civilized cultural values in the wake of the end of the first world war. It is a thriving, although troubled, democracy. Its take - it's got rid of all legislation against Jews. It's liberal in that regard. All of these things are going on. It's got a great written culture. It's got a great musical culture. It's got a great artistic culture. It's the place you would think would be the most civilized almost to be. And yet that very place, within a matter of years, turns into this.\\n\\nSo you've got a journey that they go on that's unlike - and it's not like the journey the Vikings go on or Genghis Khan or the plains goes on. This is not like that. This is a different journey. This is a journey from one pole - one extreme, if you like, to the other extreme. And in the process, they use 20th-century technology that they warp and adapt to this very service of mass killing. And unlike Stalin, who even at his worst, when he was deporting entire nations - the Kalmyk nations, the Crimean Tatars and so on. He's deporting whole nations to Siberia. Even Stalin isn't trying to put forward measures to eliminate them in their entirety. So something different, I think, is going on here.\\n\\nDAVIES: So many students of Nazism and the Holocaust have tried to in some way answer the question, how could this happen? You've interviewed a hundred or so survivors and war criminals from Auschwitz. Do you feel you have some new insights into that question?\\n\\nREES: I think what surprised me about this - because I never intended this career (laughter). Like, this kind of happened to me, you know, that I've been - written so much on this and made so many programs on this. And one of the reasons it's happened is because I keep thinking I'm getting close to being able to answer that properly. And as I - as I keep getting towards it, it keeps going away from me a bit more. So I think I'm a long way down the road, I hope, to being able to get to there. But I'm not there yet. Maybe it's absolutely impossible to get there.\\n\\nBut one thing I took from this was a big fear I've now got about people of absolute faith. I always thought faith of itself was - could only be a positive thing. Everyone talks about the importance of having faith. Well, these guys had faith, absolute faith. And there's one really desperately upsetting - all desperately upsetting. But ideologically, there's one desperately particularly upsetting moment where - in the book where I talk about how Himmler and Hoss most admired, as prisoners, Jehovah's Witnesses. They pointed to them and said, see that faith? That's the kind of faith we need in our fuhrer - absolute, unshakable faith.\\n\\nNow, of course, no one is equating what the Nazis did with Jehovah's Witnesses, who operate a whole creed of peace and love and so on. Absolutely. But the very notion of absolute faith is at the core of this. And so I'm beginning to start to have questions about people who - or communities that are absolutely certain about things.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, Laurence Rees, thanks so much for speaking with us.\\n\\nREES: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" After a break, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: Today we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Next, we'll hear Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016 at the age of 87. Wiesel was born in what was then Romania and was 15 when he and his family were sent from Hungary to Auschwitz in 1944. He was later moved to another camp, Buchenwald, from which he was liberated in 1945. Among his family, only two of his sisters survived the war.\\n\\nWiesel became one of the first survivors to devote his life to bearing witness to the Holocaust. His memoir, \\\"Night,\\\" was published in English in 1960, and he spent the rest of his life speaking about social injustice. Terry spoke with him in 1988 when his novel \\\"Twilight\\\" was published.\\n\\nTERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Why have you made it your life work to bear witness?\\n\\nELIE WIESEL: What else could one do, having gone through certain events? I believe a human being, if he or she wants to remain human, then he or she must do something with what we have seen, endured, witnessed. Not to live through an experience, but the experience is there - it's bad, but not to communicate it is worse.\\n\\nGROSS: You know, I think that it's almost a human instinct to let time dim memories of horror and tragedy. Have you fought that in a way? Have you tried to keep those memories alive so that you can continue to communicate about them?\\n\\nWIESEL: Naturally. I mean, naturally, the human being wants to forget pain. In this case, although, for most of those who went through the experience during the war, they want to remember more and more and more. They go deep into their own consciousness, into their own memory, trying to find more events, more faces, more eyes, more words, more sighs, more tears, more agonies. It's never enough because we feel that we have to tell the story, and no one can tell the story fully.\\n\\nGROSS: You once described Auschwitz as the defeat of the intellect that wants to find a meaning, with a capital M, in history. Do you feel that, nevertheless, you've been really spending your life trying to find some meaning of the Holocaust, some larger meaning you could tell us about man or about God?\\n\\nWIESEL: I'll tell you, all the questions I had remain open. I really don't believe that I found any answer to any one of the questions I had. I don't know the meaning. I don't know why it happened. I don't know how it happened. I still don't know anything, really. I'm trying to tell a story, and even the story cannot be told. And therefore, it cannot be communicated, and therefore, people - and deep down, I know - won't receive the testimony that we are giving. We are a very special kind of writers, those who write about that event. And I write very little about it, really. But I know that people cannot understand.\\n\\nGROSS: I think when you were in the camps, you saw some religious people stop praying and saw people who had not been observant turn to God. You had been very observant and very immersed in the religious texts when you were young, before you were deported to the concentration camps. How did your experiences and your survival in the camps change your own experience of religion?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, the change - to the extent that it occurred - did not occur there. It's afterwards that the problems became urgent. Inside that universe, we continued praying. We continued believing. We continued affirming. We needed that link with our past. It's only after the war that I began asking questions, and I began articulating a certain protest. And that protest is still with me. I am still angry at all the forces in history that provoked such a catastrophe. That doesn't mean that my faith left me or that I left fate. I try to develop a certain protest within fate.\\n\\nGROSS: Have you gone back to the religious texts that you were reading when you were young?\\n\\nWIESEL: I never stopped reading or studying. Even inside that universe, I studied. I had a teacher there with name I never knew and whose face I hardly saw. But he was a teacher, the head of a Talmudic school in Galicia. And we work together, and we studied together. I know. It's incredible.\\n\\nGROSS: This is in the camps.\\n\\nWIESEL: Inside - in Auschwitz. So we studied. They kept on studying from morning to evening. And after the war, the first thing I wanted was a book, was a Talmudic treatise. I never stopped studying. That probably saved me.\\n\\nGROSS: In your first novel, \\\"Night...\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: \\\"Night\\\" was not a novel. It was a memoir.\\n\\nGROSS: I don't know why I think of it as a novel.\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Every word...\\n\\nGROSS: I think of think of it as a very autobiographical novel, but...\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah. Well, I - then I guess I was going to ask you about your religious teacher who narrowly escaped from being murdered with hundreds or thousands of other Jews in the forest by the SS. And he somehow managed to escape and come back to your village to warn people about what was happening, and no one would listen.\\n\\nWIESEL: We didn't listen because he was a simple man. He was a beetle. Had he been an important person, I think some people would have listened. What is so extraordinary is when we remember today the silence, the indifference of so many people who were not inside the tragedy but on the other side, just imagine if we had heard on the radio Ben-Gurion from Israel or Roosevelt or Churchill telling Hungarian Jews don't go because they are killing. They're massacring. I think they would have believed them. But why should one believe a beetle, a man who came back from the other side and was telling such atrocious stories?\\n\\nGROSS: We're getting back to the question of madness. I think a lot of people in your village just assumed he'd lost his mind and was making up - you know, was having visions or something, that this couldn't possibly have happened.\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, absolutely. I myself - I was very close to him. And we spent many, many hours alone together every evening. And I would listen to him. Plus, I love to listen to stories, even to his stories, maybe especially to hear stories. But I didn't believe them.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel recorded in 1988. Wiesel died in 2016.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you do anything to mentally prepare for what was in store when your father told you that the next day the whole village was going to be deported, the whole ghetto was going to be deported?\\n\\nWIESEL: No. We didn't know. See; Hungarian Jewry was deported at such a pace. Everything came so fast. The Hungarians allowed the Germans to come in in March. The end of May, all the Jews were out already in Germany. In less than six weeks, Eichmann had managed to deport to their death more than 600,000 Jews - men, women and children. So it came very fast. And it ended very fast. We didn't have time to think.\\n\\nGROSS: You've described yourself as having been very weak and sickly when you were young. I know you think of yourself as having survived purely by chance. Did you learn things, though, to help you survive when you were in the camps?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Not at all. I was the wrong person, the wrong candidate for survival. I was always weak, as you said, and disarmed, cowardly. I would never try to do anything, which was not what I could have done or should have done. I never asked for a supplement of anything. I didn't volunteer. I was always pleased to think that I could be invisible. Not to make myself visible was my task. I don't know why I survived. I don't know how I survived. It was really by accident.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you know when you got out of the camps that you wanted to write?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, I knew that I was going to write before I entered the camps. I come from a tradition, from the Jewish tradition, we believe - which believes in words, in language, in communication. And already at the age of 12 or 13, I was writing. Of course, it wasn't good. It meant nothing, but I tried to write. I even found the manuscript. I went back to my hometown. It's not good. But I tried.\\n\\nAfterwards, I knew I would have to bear witness. Everyone who was there is a witness, and everyone who was there is a true witness. Others who are trying to speak about this subject occasionally are false witnesses. And I felt that I had to be a true witness. And therefore, I decided to wait for 10 years, not to speak about it but to use language related to these experiences until I knew that the words were true words.\\n\\nGROSS: Why 10 years? Why not five years? Why not one year? No, seriously. What made you think..\\n\\nGROSS: ...That 10 years is what you needed to really know what it was you wanted to say and what words you wanted to say it with?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, 10 is a biblical figure, I know. And the - it's a good figure, why not? I cannot tell you that I got up one morning and decided that - let's see, that five or six or seven. It entered my mind - it has to be 10. I decided 10.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you actually have an anniversary where like...\\n\\nGROSS: And that day you sat down to write.\\n\\nGROSS: And is that when you started to write \\\"Night?\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" yes. That's when I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" on April 11, 1955, which is 10 years later.\\n\\nGROSS: And looking back, do you think that this was definitely the right thing to do, to wait those 10 years? In what ways were you changed as a witness and as a writer during those 10 years?\\n\\nWIESEL: Maybe I didn't change, but the words in me changed. They grew. you know, Words have strange destiny, too. They grow, they get old, they die, they come back. Words can be turned into spears. They can be turned into prayers. It's a strange world that you are in when you deal with words.\\n\\nGROSS: In one of your essays, you wrote that after the war, you deliberately avoided all contact with Germans and that their presence sickened you physically. Did that change? And if so, what changed that?\\n\\nWIESEL: It did. But I didn't want to go back to Germany, really. I went once because I didn't want to judge people. I went once in the early '60s to do a piece for commentary. And I realized that every person I see in the street, I judge him or her asking, where was he, what did he do, how old is he, could I - could he have been there? And I didn't want that role, so I didn't go back. But I did go back last year in '86, '87.\\n\\nToday, you have a young generation of Germans. And I do not believe in collective guilt. So I have absolutely no problem with the young Germans. I even feel sorry for the young Germans because to be maybe sons or daughters of killers is different than to be sons and daughters of the victims. And I felt sorry for them. I still do.\\n\\nGROSS: The generations of survivors are getting older. The older generation of survivors is no longer with us. Are you concerned about what's going to happen after the generations of survivors pass on, like, who will be around to actually speak the memories?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, I'm profoundly concerned, naturally. In one of my novels, I try to describe that feeling of the last survivor, what it means to be the very last. And I would not want to be that last survivor. But on the other hand, we are leaving a legacy. We are bequeathing a certain message, a certain story. This tragedy is the most documented tragedy in recorded history. And therefore later on, if there will be a later on, anyone wishing to know will know where to go for knowledge.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988.

I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Monday, January 27, is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Today we're going to listen to two interviews. In a bit, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016. But first, we'll listen to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, the site of history's largest mass murder, as well as insights into Hitler's campaign of genocide against the Jews of Europe.\\n\\nRees' book is based on more than a hundred interviews with Auschwitz survivors and Nazi perpetrators, many of whom spoke on the record for the first time. He believes his search for the truth was aided by the fact that surviving Nazis had reached an age where candor no longer jeopardized careers and by the fall of communism, which opened up a wealth of new archival material. His book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nLAURENCE REES: Thank you very much.\\n\\nDAVIES: You note early in this book that you were one of relatively few people who've been able to interview quite a number of war criminals from three of the great totalitarian powers of the 20th century - that is, Stalinist Russia, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. And you say in this book that having done so, you can confirm that Nazi war criminals that you met were different from the other two.\\n\\nDAVIES: How were they different?\\n\\nREES: They're different in a kind of paradoxical way because when I grew up at school and first heard about the Nazis and - the whole line that was taken then in the '70s was that Nazi war criminals would give us the standard defense. Oh, I was only - I was acting under orders. I was acting under orders. And so that was kind of what you imagine, when you meet people like this, they're going to say. Well, paradoxically, that was the kind of response I got from Stalin's secret policemen, from members of the Imperial Army who committed terrible crimes in China and in the Pacific War. That was what they were saying. I didn't tend to get that from Nazi war criminals. The frightening thing to me - particularly frightening - was that most of the Nazi war criminals I've met actually, when you push them, say, well - and you say, well, why were you doing this - don't say, I was acting on your orders. Say, well, at the time, I thought what I was doing was right.\\n\\nDAVIES: And what do you attribute that to? I mean, they seemed to be true believers in the cause.\\n\\nREES: I think it's a variety of things that, in the end, for me, mean that Nazism is more horrible but more interesting as a phenomenon. I think it's to do with the fact that, certainly, if you were a secret policeman in Stalin's Russia, I think for the most part, the terror was so ubiquitous that no one was safe from the knock at the door. No one could really understand exactly why individuals were sometimes being targeted. Stalin famously had one of his own Politburo, Molotov's wife, tortured. I've talked to people who were at meetings where they stood up and were denouncing other people as enemies of the state because they were worried they'd be denounced. There didn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to some of this. So this means that the only way of making sense of it, really, for a lot of these people doing the bad things was to say, well, you know, I was doing it because I'm ordered to do it.\\n\\nSimilarly, in Imperial Japan, the level of training - the brutality of the training of Japanese soldiers, I think, is without parallel in the modern world, what these people were put through in training - bullying, the vicious beatings and so on, the indoctrination as well. But it was such that if you didn't - you know, you obeyed, and you obeyed blindly, I think, in a number of cases.\\n\\nWhat's going on in Germany is rather different. What's going on in Germany is that - I think to some extent thanks to the work of Goebbels, who - again, a horrible, nasty person, but the genius of propaganda of the 20th century. Thanks to the work of Goebbels, but also thanks to the fact that there was a genuine feeling of injustice in Germany after the end of the First World War. There was a feeling put about that Jews were to blame. There was a feeling of fear of communism, that Jews were somehow falsely attributed in their totality to communism. Simultaneously, Jews were thought to be running Roosevelt in American politics, anti-German and so on. So there were a whole series of what they took to be, at the time, pragmatic, positive reasons to do what they were doing, and that's one of the frightening things about it.\\n\\nDAVIES: When the Nazis spoke of achieving the Final Solution to the Jewish problem in the early years of the war, is it clear they meant extermination of the Jews?\\n\\nREES: No, they didn't mean extermination, I don't believe. It's clear that the words Final Solution change in meaning, I believe, during 1941. When Heydrich is charged by Goring with organizing the Final Solution to the Jewish problem, initially, the order explicitly states evacuation. And that was the overt policy, certainly, since 1938 and the Anschluss with Austria. When the German troops go into Austria, they, under Eichmann of the SS of - you know, later absolutely infamous for being one of the organizers of the murders in the Final Solution - he organizes a system of expropriation, of robbing, of treating violently the Jews of Vienna, robbing them and then those who can almost pay to go, expelling them.\\n\\nI think that what's clear is that Hitler always hated the Jews. He always loathed the Jews. He always wanted rid of the Jews in one way or another. The form that that wanting rid of would take varied at different points. The Final Solution, therefore, varied, I think, at different points. And certainly, at the beginning of the war, the Final Solution, I think, to the Jewish problem is one as they see it. I mean, horrible to use this language. It's not a problem. It's the problem of their mentality. But as they described it, the Jewish problem - the way to, quote, \\\"solve,\\\" unquote, this was by evacuation.\\n\\nDAVIES: It's remarkable that you find places where people talk about the notion of mass killings as being uncivilized and un-German.\\n\\nREES: Yes, that's right. Both Heydrich and Himmler say that in the - 1940. And so we know, I think, beyond reasonable doubt that the Final Solution does not mean extermination because in - actually on paper, Himmler and Heydrich are talking about extermination as being uncivilized when later on openly, at his speech at Poznan in 1943, Himmler is talking about physical extermination. Something changes.\\n\\nAnd again, we know that from the documents that - and from eyewitness testimony that in the summer of 1940, they had this - what it seems now at this distance - utterly outlandish, insane plan to transport Jews to Madagascar, the island of Madagascar of Africa. What they anticipated, the Nazis, was that the war was going to end in 1940. Britain would make peace, and they had - would have the French colonies at their disposal, including Madagascar. And the Jews would be able in French ships probably to be shipped there, which is why they were herded into ghettos. Ghettos were only ever seen as a temporary measure prior to expulsion.\\n\\nBut again, as you see time and again in this terrible history, things don't go the way the Nazis want. They're constantly - really, they're always constantly thinking the war's going to end. They keep thinking, any minute now, any moment now, the war's going to stop. We'll have won, and we'll be able to deal with this in this way. And it never does end when they think it's going to end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, the development of this notion of a Final Solution from being the evacuation of Jews to the extermination of Jews you sort of describe as a process of increasing radicalization. Now...\\n\\nDAVIES: What does this mean?\\n\\nREES: So I think one of the best examples of this cumulative radicalization, of the Nazis responding brutally to crises that they themselves have created, occurs in the Lodz ghetto, where what happens is that the Jews have been imprisoned. They've been forced to give up their money to buy food. They've run out of money, so they begin to starve. So then Nazi functionaries face a choice. Some say, let them all starve. Others say, no, no. We need to get something from these people, exploit them. That view prevails. They put them to work in horrible conditions, of course, and they pay them a tiny pittance. But those who are working can actually feed themselves a bit. Other people - the old people, children - are suffering terribly and still starving.\\n\\nAnd actually, one Nazi functionary looks at this situation they themselves have created and can - and writes a note saying, wouldn't it be more humane to kill these people rather than let them starve? So that's an example of how they end up in this position that they themselves have created, where they almost - where someone has the obscenity to write that it's more humane to kill somebody than to leave them to starve.\\n\\nDAVIES: So it's done with this utterly immoral idea of herding people into ghettos with the idea you will transport them out. When you can't transport them out...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...They begin to starve. And one thing leads to another, and then you've come to this utterly horrific conclusion that...\\n\\nREES: Yes. And so what...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...You have to kill people - hundreds of thousands.\\n\\nREES: And also you see - exactly. And what's going on in the minds of a lot of these Nazis - unbelievably, we might think today, rightly - is a sense of annoyance and indignation as - that the Jews have brought this on themselves because the war is still going on, and they can't be expelled.\\n\\nSo I've heard Nazis say - and seen it - that they say, oh, well, of course Churchill is controlled by the Jews. That's why they'd - the British don't do the logical, sensible thing in 1940 and make peace with us.\\n\\nwe're still trapped in this war, and we're in the war as a result of what the Jews are doing. And if the war had gone - if the war had ended, we'd been able to expel the Jews somewhere - where incidentally they would probably have had some form of genocidal horror awaiting them anyway - but they would have been expelled somewhere, and now we can't expel them. What are we supposed to do with them?\\n\\nAnd so this is the kind of mentality that you hear and you see it absolutely plainly now, I think, as a result of a lot of new research around Pearl Harbor, that there are killings going on before Pearl Harbor, notably in Eastern Europe and behind the lines in the war against the Soviet Union. But there's nothing - there is no major death camping operation. But what happens is, as soon as Pearl Harbor happens, you see Hitler's rhetoric change. And he starts talking about, right now it's a world war, and you remember my prophecy of 1939, in which he stated if the Jews succeed in causing a world war, the result will be their annihilation.\\n\\nHe sees this as a fulfillment of a prophecy. He said, if the Jews get involved and cause a world war - America coming into the war is de facto a world war. They simultaneously think the Jews are not just behind Stalin and - but they're behind Roosevelt as well. It's pathological, this stuff. They absolutely believed that I think. And so as a result of that, they absolutely push forward with a massive expansion in the killing around that time, immediately after Pearl Harbor.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to the interview I recorded in 2005 with journalist Laurence Rees, when his book \\\"Auschwitz: A New History\\\" was published.\\n\\nWhen the Nazis first began executing Jews in large numbers, they did it, really, with firing squads. What was the impact of that kind of close-quarter execution on the Germans who carried it out?\\n\\nREES: The impact for quite a substantial proportion of them was terrible. They were emotionally made distraught by this. They're having to shoot women and children at very close range. And this - thus, I believe, begins this journey to the gas chambers that we know of, the infamous gas chambers. And it's because, we see, when Himmler visits Minsk in August 1941, he's told of the emotional problems that the killing in this way, the shooting killings are doing to his men. And he puts in training, as a result, a whole series of experiments to devise a way of killing that is not so emotionally disturbing to his men.\\n\\nI'd always thought that the reason that the gas chambers were devised was primarily to kill people in large numbers. Well, it wasn't just that at all; it was actually so that there was a less emotionally stressful way that the killers could commit murder.\\n\\nDAVIES: They began initially by putting people into a - I guess, in a cabin of some kind and piping exhaust fumes into it.\\n\\nREES: That's right. Well, what happens now again - and we can see this as an example of both cumulative radicalism and competition within the Nazi state - is various people at various different locations come up with different initiatives. What happens is there's an initiative which is the gas van, which is a van where you connect the exhaust back into a compartment hermetically sealed in the rear, where people are gassed. There's the building of the - camp Belzec, which is the first stationary gas chambers, again, using large engines with carbon gases going in to gas them.\\n\\nAnd then at the same time, in September 1941, you find a totally different initiative beginning at Auschwitz, which is the only camp where this initiative begins, which is the use of Zyklon B. Zyklon B is a powerful insecticide using - used for disinfecting rooms. And it was already in Auschwitz, and they used it for delousing prisoners' clothes and rooms because they had a terrible problem with lice because of the inhumane conditions, not least, that prisoners were kept in.\\n\\nAnd one of the functionaries there thinks to himself, well, it's got printed on the Zyklon B cans - dangerous to life; don't go in the room while this is being let off. And he goes, well, actually, of course, if you want to kill people, they should be in the room. So he starts experimenting, not on Jews but on the sick and on Soviet prisoners of war at Auschwitz. And he starts with Zyklon B. The experiments go wrong to start with. They alter doses. They do experiments. And eventually, they evolve a different method of killing to the ones used in the death camps of Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec.\\n\\nDAVIES: Now, as you noted, Auschwitz was not originally conceived of as a death camp, but as a labor camp, which meant that it was large and had lots and lots of barracks. And you note that when the killings of Jews really accelerated in 1942 that this was done not so much at Auschwitz, but at three other camps - at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. And...\\n\\nDAVIES: They were specifically set up as death camps. And you made the point that when visitors go to those sites, they are always shocked at how small they are even though...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...These three camps alone accounted for 1.7 million deaths. Why were these deaths camps so small? How did they function?\\n\\nREES: Because they had no other function than killing. Auschwitz is unique in the history of the Nazi states, unique in the history of the world. It's not just the site of the largest mass murder the world's ever seen as a physical site. It's also unique in the Nazi state in that it's the only camp that combines two functions. It's both a concentration camp and a death camp, and those functions vary at different times in its history.\\n\\nWhat's happening at places like Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor is they are set up in 1942 - all of them open in 1942. They are set up purely to murder Jews. And if you plan on just - just, I say, just - murdering people, one of the shocking things is you need no real space at all. These places are a few hundred yards square - nothing left of them now because the Nazis themselves destroyed these camps in late 1943. They knew that they wanted to keep this their secret. And they were essentially places where trains would arrive, and the Jews would be taken off. And 99 - more than 99% of these people would be dead, probably, within two hours. So there was no stay of any kind, really, at all.\\n\\nA camp like Treblinka, which was capable of killing 300,000 people in little more - in around less than two months in the summer of 1942 - 300,000 people in that one small space - it was run by around 20 Germans and about 100 Ukrainian guards. And these Ukrainians had been mostly selected from prison camps. They had been people fighting on the Russian side who, in the horror of the prison camps that the Germans set up for these Russians where millions died, were offered this chance of saving themselves, to go and work on the German side.\\n\\nAnd then there was the third category of people working in these camps who were, tragically, Jews themselves. The Nazis selected, very occasionally, from incoming transports a number of fit Jewish people and forced them, on pain of their own immediate murder, to participate in the process by cutting people's hair, by showing the way to the gas chamber, by cleaning the gas chambers, by burning the bodies and so on. And the torment that these people went through is scarcely imaginable.\\n\\nDAVIES: So the actual horrific task of murder, of cleaning the bodies, of cleaning out the chambers after the killing has occurred is, by and large, not done by Germans.\\n\\nREES: Never done by Germans, really. No.\\n\\nDAVIES: Yeah. And that was true at Auschwitz as well.\\n\\nREES: So they end up at the huge, industrial-style killing factories of Auschwitz-Birkenau. You have a crematorium gas chamber complex that's capable, in the summer of 1941, of killing 10,000 people in one day - 10,000 people in one day. And it's run by between 2 to 4 Germans and around about 100 Jews. Now, the Nazis save the absolute moment of murder to themselves. They're the ones who drop the canisters of Zyklon B actually into the gas chamber. But pretty much all the other tasks involved in making this operate are run by Jewish Sonderkommando, who we know both from interviewing some - the few people who survived this and also from documents that Jewish Sonderkommando wrote and hid in the foundations of the building often at the time. The torment these people went through was practically indescribable.\\n\\nDAVIES: I was struck by your description of the arrival buildings at the death camps, that they often were fairly pleasant-looking, I mean, with flower plantings and the kind - I guess designed to reinsure the incoming inmates...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...That their fate was not what it was going to be.\\n\\nREES: Again, this is all part of the cynicism, but it's also part of the learning curve that the Nazis go on because what happens at Treblinka, which was the most deadly, if you like, of all of these death camps outside of Auschwitz - they were killing so many people that the system broke down - summer of 1942 - that the system broke down. There were bodies everywhere. There was just mayhem, people being shot. It was chaos.\\n\\nSo they actually had to shut it down and reorganize it. And the new commander of Treblinka, what he managed to do as he pushed it forward was come up with all of these devices like the fake railway station, fake timetables, lovely flowers - same thing happened at Sobibor. One of the most extraordinary individuals I've ever met, Toivi Blatt, who survived Sobibor, said, actually, when he got off there, he'd been expecting some horrible place. He said, it was always beautiful. And as you say, it's all designed so that when, say, Jews coming from Holland arrive, they're told, you are at a transit station, hygiene stop while - we just need to take a shower, have your hair cut and we're going to move on east. And it's deliberately designed to do that.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more from him after a break, and we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. Monday, January 27 is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, based on more than 100 interviews with survivors and Nazi perpetrators. It's called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nDAVIES: You note that Auschwitz became, really, a death camp at a point when the Nazi death machine had become very well-developed, and Nazi initiative and ingenuity had addressed some of the technical difficulties of mass murder and had worked out solutions. Tell us a bit about those arriving Jews who were selected for immediate death. What exactly faced them, and who did the work?\\n\\nREES: Well, they would be taken from the - by the time - in 1944, by the time this became the most sophisticated procedure, they'd be taken straight from the arrival ramp, which was the area they arrived at, directly inside Birkenau. The railway line ran into the camp. They'd be taken, really, a few hundred yards round to one of four combination gas chamber-crematoriums.\\n\\nThey would then be taken down in two - cases of two of them, they'd be taken on - all on ground level. The other two - one had basement, undressing rooms and gas chambers. They'd be taken down or into a room where they'd be told to undress because they were going to have to have a shower as part of the camp's admittance procedure. And they would then be crammed into an airtight room - the door shut, locked behind them.\\n\\nAnd then either from above, in the case of the basement gas chambers or through the windows of the ones all on the ground floor, canisters of Zyklon B would be thrown in. And it would normally - it would take - dependent on how many people were in these gas chambers, dependent on the weather because Zyklon B was more effective the warmer the air was - it would take 15, 20 minutes for these people to die, I think, a horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible death of suffocation and poisoning.\\n\\nThe gas chambers would then be opened. The Sonderkommando, Jewish - other Jewish prisoners with gas masks, would have to go in, would take out the bodies, would - in the case of the adults - go through them and take out the gold teeth, would shave the hair of the women. The bodies would then be pushed into lifts taken up to the first - to the ground level or the basement gas chambers, where the bodies would be burned. And then their ashes would be collected and either thrown in the immediate area or taken down to the nearby river, Vistula. So that was the horror of the process that they devised in the end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Were many of the SS officials who conducted the murder at Auschwitz held accountable for their actions?\\n\\nREES: Well, I think this is one of the great scandals of this story, a story rich in scandal at every level. But this is one of the greater scandals, which is that less than - well, maybe, 12%, 10% of SS people who worked at Auschwitz were ever prosecuted. Around 90% of the SS who worked at Auschwitz during the war escaped all forms of prosecution. And myself, I think that's a scandal.\\n\\nDAVIES: Why was that?\\n\\nREES: One of the reasons that so few people were prosecuted was that by the 1960s, the German prosecutors had taken the view that unless a member of the SS was absolutely directly involved in the killing or had been directly involved in acts of brutality - physical brutality - then they could get off scot-free. And of course, it meant that the way that the gas chambers had been devised, which was that so few Germans were needed for their actual physical operation, it meant that the vast majority of SS at the camp could say, oh, I wasn't really directly involved in the killing at all.\\n\\nNow, myself, I think that's a calamity. That's terrible because, of course, if you're working in the currency units counting out money, if you're working in the SS transport division, if you're a guard at the camp, you are directly involved in the operation of the camp that results - that's an extermination center. So I certainly disagree with - you know, for all the good it's going to do anybody that I disagree, but I certainly disagree that they took that view.\\n\\nDAVIES: In this book, you compare the crimes of the Holocaust to other mass exterminations in history - going as far back as Genghis Khan's genocide in Persia - and conclude that this represents the lowest act in human history and should not be allowed to recede into distant memory as some of these other mass killings have. What's different about this extermination?\\n\\nREES: I think that if you're looking at how you should think about events in the past - or even events in the present, actually - what you've got to do is look at the overall circumstances in which these things happen. You know, it's not much good thinking, well, oh, the Vikings were terrible. Well, the Vikings operated in a system of values at the time that was - they were, by all accounts from latest research on Vikings, for example, scarcely better or worse than any other 10th century marauding hordes. I mean, it's a ludicrous - it seems to me a ludicrous way to go to start blaming Vikings for being Vikings.\\n\\nSomething different is going on here. What's happening is that you are taking a cultured nation at the heart of Europe in the 20th century, long after the Enlightenment, that has adopted absolute civilized cultural values in the wake of the end of the first world war. It is a thriving, although troubled, democracy. Its take - it's got rid of all legislation against Jews. It's liberal in that regard. All of these things are going on. It's got a great written culture. It's got a great musical culture. It's got a great artistic culture. It's the place you would think would be the most civilized almost to be. And yet that very place, within a matter of years, turns into this.\\n\\nSo you've got a journey that they go on that's unlike - and it's not like the journey the Vikings go on or Genghis Khan or the plains goes on. This is not like that. This is a different journey. This is a journey from one pole - one extreme, if you like, to the other extreme. And in the process, they use 20th-century technology that they warp and adapt to this very service of mass killing. And unlike Stalin, who even at his worst, when he was deporting entire nations - the Kalmyk nations, the Crimean Tatars and so on. He's deporting whole nations to Siberia. Even Stalin isn't trying to put forward measures to eliminate them in their entirety. So something different, I think, is going on here.\\n\\nDAVIES: So many students of Nazism and the Holocaust have tried to in some way answer the question, how could this happen? You've interviewed a hundred or so survivors and war criminals from Auschwitz. Do you feel you have some new insights into that question?\\n\\nREES: I think what surprised me about this - because I never intended this career (laughter). Like, this kind of happened to me, you know, that I've been - written so much on this and made so many programs on this. And one of the reasons it's happened is because I keep thinking I'm getting close to being able to answer that properly. And as I - as I keep getting towards it, it keeps going away from me a bit more. So I think I'm a long way down the road, I hope, to being able to get to there. But I'm not there yet. Maybe it's absolutely impossible to get there.\\n\\nBut one thing I took from this was a big fear I've now got about people of absolute faith. I always thought faith of itself was - could only be a positive thing. Everyone talks about the importance of having faith. Well, these guys had faith, absolute faith. And there's one really desperately upsetting - all desperately upsetting. But ideologically, there's one desperately particularly upsetting moment where - in the book where I talk about how Himmler and Hoss most admired, as prisoners, Jehovah's Witnesses. They pointed to them and said, see that faith? That's the kind of faith we need in our fuhrer - absolute, unshakable faith.\\n\\nNow, of course, no one is equating what the Nazis did with Jehovah's Witnesses, who operate a whole creed of peace and love and so on. Absolutely. But the very notion of absolute faith is at the core of this. And so I'm beginning to start to have questions about people who - or communities that are absolutely certain about things.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, Laurence Rees, thanks so much for speaking with us.\\n\\nREES: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" After a break, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: Today we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Next, we'll hear Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016 at the age of 87. Wiesel was born in what was then Romania and was 15 when he and his family were sent from Hungary to Auschwitz in 1944. He was later moved to another camp, Buchenwald, from which he was liberated in 1945. Among his family, only two of his sisters survived the war.\\n\\nWiesel became one of the first survivors to devote his life to bearing witness to the Holocaust. His memoir, \\\"Night,\\\" was published in English in 1960, and he spent the rest of his life speaking about social injustice. Terry spoke with him in 1988 when his novel \\\"Twilight\\\" was published.\\n\\nTERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Why have you made it your life work to bear witness?\\n\\nELIE WIESEL: What else could one do, having gone through certain events? I believe a human being, if he or she wants to remain human, then he or she must do something with what we have seen, endured, witnessed. Not to live through an experience, but the experience is there - it's bad, but not to communicate it is worse.\\n\\nGROSS: You know, I think that it's almost a human instinct to let time dim memories of horror and tragedy. Have you fought that in a way? Have you tried to keep those memories alive so that you can continue to communicate about them?\\n\\nWIESEL: Naturally. I mean, naturally, the human being wants to forget pain. In this case, although, for most of those who went through the experience during the war, they want to remember more and more and more. They go deep into their own consciousness, into their own memory, trying to find more events, more faces, more eyes, more words, more sighs, more tears, more agonies. It's never enough because we feel that we have to tell the story, and no one can tell the story fully.\\n\\nGROSS: You once described Auschwitz as the defeat of the intellect that wants to find a meaning, with a capital M, in history. Do you feel that, nevertheless, you've been really spending your life trying to find some meaning of the Holocaust, some larger meaning you could tell us about man or about God?\\n\\nWIESEL: I'll tell you, all the questions I had remain open. I really don't believe that I found any answer to any one of the questions I had. I don't know the meaning. I don't know why it happened. I don't know how it happened. I still don't know anything, really. I'm trying to tell a story, and even the story cannot be told. And therefore, it cannot be communicated, and therefore, people - and deep down, I know - won't receive the testimony that we are giving. We are a very special kind of writers, those who write about that event. And I write very little about it, really. But I know that people cannot understand.\\n\\nGROSS: I think when you were in the camps, you saw some religious people stop praying and saw people who had not been observant turn to God. You had been very observant and very immersed in the religious texts when you were young, before you were deported to the concentration camps. How did your experiences and your survival in the camps change your own experience of religion?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, the change - to the extent that it occurred - did not occur there. It's afterwards that the problems became urgent. Inside that universe, we continued praying. We continued believing. We continued affirming. We needed that link with our past. It's only after the war that I began asking questions, and I began articulating a certain protest. And that protest is still with me. I am still angry at all the forces in history that provoked such a catastrophe. That doesn't mean that my faith left me or that I left fate. I try to develop a certain protest within fate.\\n\\nGROSS: Have you gone back to the religious texts that you were reading when you were young?\\n\\nWIESEL: I never stopped reading or studying. Even inside that universe, I studied. I had a teacher there with name I never knew and whose face I hardly saw. But he was a teacher, the head of a Talmudic school in Galicia. And we work together, and we studied together. I know. It's incredible.\\n\\nGROSS: This is in the camps.\\n\\nWIESEL: Inside - in Auschwitz. So we studied. They kept on studying from morning to evening. And after the war, the first thing I wanted was a book, was a Talmudic treatise. I never stopped studying. That probably saved me.\\n\\nGROSS: In your first novel, \\\"Night...\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: \\\"Night\\\" was not a novel. It was a memoir.\\n\\nGROSS: I don't know why I think of it as a novel.\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Every word...\\n\\nGROSS: I think of think of it as a very autobiographical novel, but...\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah. Well, I - then I guess I was going to ask you about your religious teacher who narrowly escaped from being murdered with hundreds or thousands of other Jews in the forest by the SS. And he somehow managed to escape and come back to your village to warn people about what was happening, and no one would listen.\\n\\nWIESEL: We didn't listen because he was a simple man. He was a beetle. Had he been an important person, I think some people would have listened. What is so extraordinary is when we remember today the silence, the indifference of so many people who were not inside the tragedy but on the other side, just imagine if we had heard on the radio Ben-Gurion from Israel or Roosevelt or Churchill telling Hungarian Jews don't go because they are killing. They're massacring. I think they would have believed them. But why should one believe a beetle, a man who came back from the other side and was telling such atrocious stories?\\n\\nGROSS: We're getting back to the question of madness. I think a lot of people in your village just assumed he'd lost his mind and was making up - you know, was having visions or something, that this couldn't possibly have happened.\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, absolutely. I myself - I was very close to him. And we spent many, many hours alone together every evening. And I would listen to him. Plus, I love to listen to stories, even to his stories, maybe especially to hear stories. But I didn't believe them.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel recorded in 1988. Wiesel died in 2016.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you do anything to mentally prepare for what was in store when your father told you that the next day the whole village was going to be deported, the whole ghetto was going to be deported?\\n\\nWIESEL: No. We didn't know. See; Hungarian Jewry was deported at such a pace. Everything came so fast. The Hungarians allowed the Germans to come in in March. The end of May, all the Jews were out already in Germany. In less than six weeks, Eichmann had managed to deport to their death more than 600,000 Jews - men, women and children. So it came very fast. And it ended very fast. We didn't have time to think.\\n\\nGROSS: You've described yourself as having been very weak and sickly when you were young. I know you think of yourself as having survived purely by chance. Did you learn things, though, to help you survive when you were in the camps?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Not at all. I was the wrong person, the wrong candidate for survival. I was always weak, as you said, and disarmed, cowardly. I would never try to do anything, which was not what I could have done or should have done. I never asked for a supplement of anything. I didn't volunteer. I was always pleased to think that I could be invisible. Not to make myself visible was my task. I don't know why I survived. I don't know how I survived. It was really by accident.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you know when you got out of the camps that you wanted to write?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, I knew that I was going to write before I entered the camps. I come from a tradition, from the Jewish tradition, we believe - which believes in words, in language, in communication. And already at the age of 12 or 13, I was writing. Of course, it wasn't good. It meant nothing, but I tried to write. I even found the manuscript. I went back to my hometown. It's not good. But I tried.\\n\\nAfterwards, I knew I would have to bear witness. Everyone who was there is a witness, and everyone who was there is a true witness. Others who are trying to speak about this subject occasionally are false witnesses. And I felt that I had to be a true witness. And therefore, I decided to wait for 10 years, not to speak about it but to use language related to these experiences until I knew that the words were true words.\\n\\nGROSS: Why 10 years? Why not five years? Why not one year? No, seriously. What made you think..\\n\\nGROSS: ...That 10 years is what you needed to really know what it was you wanted to say and what words you wanted to say it with?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, 10 is a biblical figure, I know. And the - it's a good figure, why not? I cannot tell you that I got up one morning and decided that - let's see, that five or six or seven. It entered my mind - it has to be 10. I decided 10.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you actually have an anniversary where like...\\n\\nGROSS: And that day you sat down to write.\\n\\nGROSS: And is that when you started to write \\\"Night?\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" yes. That's when I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" on April 11, 1955, which is 10 years later.\\n\\nGROSS: And looking back, do you think that this was definitely the right thing to do, to wait those 10 years? In what ways were you changed as a witness and as a writer during those 10 years?\\n\\nWIESEL: Maybe I didn't change, but the words in me changed. They grew. you know, Words have strange destiny, too. They grow, they get old, they die, they come back. Words can be turned into spears. They can be turned into prayers. It's a strange world that you are in when you deal with words.\\n\\nGROSS: In one of your essays, you wrote that after the war, you deliberately avoided all contact with Germans and that their presence sickened you physically. Did that change? And if so, what changed that?\\n\\nWIESEL: It did. But I didn't want to go back to Germany, really. I went once because I didn't want to judge people. I went once in the early '60s to do a piece for commentary. And I realized that every person I see in the street, I judge him or her asking, where was he, what did he do, how old is he, could I - could he have been there? And I didn't want that role, so I didn't go back. But I did go back last year in '86, '87.\\n\\nToday, you have a young generation of Germans. And I do not believe in collective guilt. So I have absolutely no problem with the young Germans. I even feel sorry for the young Germans because to be maybe sons or daughters of killers is different than to be sons and daughters of the victims. And I felt sorry for them. I still do.\\n\\nGROSS: The generations of survivors are getting older. The older generation of survivors is no longer with us. Are you concerned about what's going to happen after the generations of survivors pass on, like, who will be around to actually speak the memories?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, I'm profoundly concerned, naturally. In one of my novels, I try to describe that feeling of the last survivor, what it means to be the very last. And I would not want to be that last survivor. But on the other hand, we are leaving a legacy. We are bequeathing a certain message, a certain story. This tragedy is the most documented tragedy in recorded history. And therefore later on, if there will be a later on, anyone wishing to know will know where to go for knowledge.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988.

I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Monday, January 27, is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Today we're going to listen to two interviews. In a bit, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016. But first, we'll listen to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, the site of history's largest mass murder, as well as insights into Hitler's campaign of genocide against the Jews of Europe.\\n\\nRees' book is based on more than a hundred interviews with Auschwitz survivors and Nazi perpetrators, many of whom spoke on the record for the first time. He believes his search for the truth was aided by the fact that surviving Nazis had reached an age where candor no longer jeopardized careers and by the fall of communism, which opened up a wealth of new archival material. His book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nLAURENCE REES: Thank you very much.\\n\\nDAVIES: You note early in this book that you were one of relatively few people who've been able to interview quite a number of war criminals from three of the great totalitarian powers of the 20th century - that is, Stalinist Russia, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. And you say in this book that having done so, you can confirm that Nazi war criminals that you met were different from the other two.\\n\\nDAVIES: How were they different?\\n\\nREES: They're different in a kind of paradoxical way because when I grew up at school and first heard about the Nazis and - the whole line that was taken then in the '70s was that Nazi war criminals would give us the standard defense. Oh, I was only - I was acting under orders. I was acting under orders. And so that was kind of what you imagine, when you meet people like this, they're going to say. Well, paradoxically, that was the kind of response I got from Stalin's secret policemen, from members of the Imperial Army who committed terrible crimes in China and in the Pacific War. That was what they were saying. I didn't tend to get that from Nazi war criminals. The frightening thing to me - particularly frightening - was that most of the Nazi war criminals I've met actually, when you push them, say, well - and you say, well, why were you doing this - don't say, I was acting on your orders. Say, well, at the time, I thought what I was doing was right.\\n\\nDAVIES: And what do you attribute that to? I mean, they seemed to be true believers in the cause.\\n\\nREES: I think it's a variety of things that, in the end, for me, mean that Nazism is more horrible but more interesting as a phenomenon. I think it's to do with the fact that, certainly, if you were a secret policeman in Stalin's Russia, I think for the most part, the terror was so ubiquitous that no one was safe from the knock at the door. No one could really understand exactly why individuals were sometimes being targeted. Stalin famously had one of his own Politburo, Molotov's wife, tortured. I've talked to people who were at meetings where they stood up and were denouncing other people as enemies of the state because they were worried they'd be denounced. There didn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to some of this. So this means that the only way of making sense of it, really, for a lot of these people doing the bad things was to say, well, you know, I was doing it because I'm ordered to do it.\\n\\nSimilarly, in Imperial Japan, the level of training - the brutality of the training of Japanese soldiers, I think, is without parallel in the modern world, what these people were put through in training - bullying, the vicious beatings and so on, the indoctrination as well. But it was such that if you didn't - you know, you obeyed, and you obeyed blindly, I think, in a number of cases.\\n\\nWhat's going on in Germany is rather different. What's going on in Germany is that - I think to some extent thanks to the work of Goebbels, who - again, a horrible, nasty person, but the genius of propaganda of the 20th century. Thanks to the work of Goebbels, but also thanks to the fact that there was a genuine feeling of injustice in Germany after the end of the First World War. There was a feeling put about that Jews were to blame. There was a feeling of fear of communism, that Jews were somehow falsely attributed in their totality to communism. Simultaneously, Jews were thought to be running Roosevelt in American politics, anti-German and so on. So there were a whole series of what they took to be, at the time, pragmatic, positive reasons to do what they were doing, and that's one of the frightening things about it.\\n\\nDAVIES: When the Nazis spoke of achieving the Final Solution to the Jewish problem in the early years of the war, is it clear they meant extermination of the Jews?\\n\\nREES: No, they didn't mean extermination, I don't believe. It's clear that the words Final Solution change in meaning, I believe, during 1941. When Heydrich is charged by Goring with organizing the Final Solution to the Jewish problem, initially, the order explicitly states evacuation. And that was the overt policy, certainly, since 1938 and the Anschluss with Austria. When the German troops go into Austria, they, under Eichmann of the SS of - you know, later absolutely infamous for being one of the organizers of the murders in the Final Solution - he organizes a system of expropriation, of robbing, of treating violently the Jews of Vienna, robbing them and then those who can almost pay to go, expelling them.\\n\\nI think that what's clear is that Hitler always hated the Jews. He always loathed the Jews. He always wanted rid of the Jews in one way or another. The form that that wanting rid of would take varied at different points. The Final Solution, therefore, varied, I think, at different points. And certainly, at the beginning of the war, the Final Solution, I think, to the Jewish problem is one as they see it. I mean, horrible to use this language. It's not a problem. It's the problem of their mentality. But as they described it, the Jewish problem - the way to, quote, \\\"solve,\\\" unquote, this was by evacuation.\\n\\nDAVIES: It's remarkable that you find places where people talk about the notion of mass killings as being uncivilized and un-German.\\n\\nREES: Yes, that's right. Both Heydrich and Himmler say that in the - 1940. And so we know, I think, beyond reasonable doubt that the Final Solution does not mean extermination because in - actually on paper, Himmler and Heydrich are talking about extermination as being uncivilized when later on openly, at his speech at Poznan in 1943, Himmler is talking about physical extermination. Something changes.\\n\\nAnd again, we know that from the documents that - and from eyewitness testimony that in the summer of 1940, they had this - what it seems now at this distance - utterly outlandish, insane plan to transport Jews to Madagascar, the island of Madagascar of Africa. What they anticipated, the Nazis, was that the war was going to end in 1940. Britain would make peace, and they had - would have the French colonies at their disposal, including Madagascar. And the Jews would be able in French ships probably to be shipped there, which is why they were herded into ghettos. Ghettos were only ever seen as a temporary measure prior to expulsion.\\n\\nBut again, as you see time and again in this terrible history, things don't go the way the Nazis want. They're constantly - really, they're always constantly thinking the war's going to end. They keep thinking, any minute now, any moment now, the war's going to stop. We'll have won, and we'll be able to deal with this in this way. And it never does end when they think it's going to end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, the development of this notion of a Final Solution from being the evacuation of Jews to the extermination of Jews you sort of describe as a process of increasing radicalization. Now...\\n\\nDAVIES: What does this mean?\\n\\nREES: So I think one of the best examples of this cumulative radicalization, of the Nazis responding brutally to crises that they themselves have created, occurs in the Lodz ghetto, where what happens is that the Jews have been imprisoned. They've been forced to give up their money to buy food. They've run out of money, so they begin to starve. So then Nazi functionaries face a choice. Some say, let them all starve. Others say, no, no. We need to get something from these people, exploit them. That view prevails. They put them to work in horrible conditions, of course, and they pay them a tiny pittance. But those who are working can actually feed themselves a bit. Other people - the old people, children - are suffering terribly and still starving.\\n\\nAnd actually, one Nazi functionary looks at this situation they themselves have created and can - and writes a note saying, wouldn't it be more humane to kill these people rather than let them starve? So that's an example of how they end up in this position that they themselves have created, where they almost - where someone has the obscenity to write that it's more humane to kill somebody than to leave them to starve.\\n\\nDAVIES: So it's done with this utterly immoral idea of herding people into ghettos with the idea you will transport them out. When you can't transport them out...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...They begin to starve. And one thing leads to another, and then you've come to this utterly horrific conclusion that...\\n\\nREES: Yes. And so what...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...You have to kill people - hundreds of thousands.\\n\\nREES: And also you see - exactly. And what's going on in the minds of a lot of these Nazis - unbelievably, we might think today, rightly - is a sense of annoyance and indignation as - that the Jews have brought this on themselves because the war is still going on, and they can't be expelled.\\n\\nSo I've heard Nazis say - and seen it - that they say, oh, well, of course Churchill is controlled by the Jews. That's why they'd - the British don't do the logical, sensible thing in 1940 and make peace with us.\\n\\nwe're still trapped in this war, and we're in the war as a result of what the Jews are doing. And if the war had gone - if the war had ended, we'd been able to expel the Jews somewhere - where incidentally they would probably have had some form of genocidal horror awaiting them anyway - but they would have been expelled somewhere, and now we can't expel them. What are we supposed to do with them?\\n\\nAnd so this is the kind of mentality that you hear and you see it absolutely plainly now, I think, as a result of a lot of new research around Pearl Harbor, that there are killings going on before Pearl Harbor, notably in Eastern Europe and behind the lines in the war against the Soviet Union. But there's nothing - there is no major death camping operation. But what happens is, as soon as Pearl Harbor happens, you see Hitler's rhetoric change. And he starts talking about, right now it's a world war, and you remember my prophecy of 1939, in which he stated if the Jews succeed in causing a world war, the result will be their annihilation.\\n\\nHe sees this as a fulfillment of a prophecy. He said, if the Jews get involved and cause a world war - America coming into the war is de facto a world war. They simultaneously think the Jews are not just behind Stalin and - but they're behind Roosevelt as well. It's pathological, this stuff. They absolutely believed that I think. And so as a result of that, they absolutely push forward with a massive expansion in the killing around that time, immediately after Pearl Harbor.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to the interview I recorded in 2005 with journalist Laurence Rees, when his book \\\"Auschwitz: A New History\\\" was published.\\n\\nWhen the Nazis first began executing Jews in large numbers, they did it, really, with firing squads. What was the impact of that kind of close-quarter execution on the Germans who carried it out?\\n\\nREES: The impact for quite a substantial proportion of them was terrible. They were emotionally made distraught by this. They're having to shoot women and children at very close range. And this - thus, I believe, begins this journey to the gas chambers that we know of, the infamous gas chambers. And it's because, we see, when Himmler visits Minsk in August 1941, he's told of the emotional problems that the killing in this way, the shooting killings are doing to his men. And he puts in training, as a result, a whole series of experiments to devise a way of killing that is not so emotionally disturbing to his men.\\n\\nI'd always thought that the reason that the gas chambers were devised was primarily to kill people in large numbers. Well, it wasn't just that at all; it was actually so that there was a less emotionally stressful way that the killers could commit murder.\\n\\nDAVIES: They began initially by putting people into a - I guess, in a cabin of some kind and piping exhaust fumes into it.\\n\\nREES: That's right. Well, what happens now again - and we can see this as an example of both cumulative radicalism and competition within the Nazi state - is various people at various different locations come up with different initiatives. What happens is there's an initiative which is the gas van, which is a van where you connect the exhaust back into a compartment hermetically sealed in the rear, where people are gassed. There's the building of the - camp Belzec, which is the first stationary gas chambers, again, using large engines with carbon gases going in to gas them.\\n\\nAnd then at the same time, in September 1941, you find a totally different initiative beginning at Auschwitz, which is the only camp where this initiative begins, which is the use of Zyklon B. Zyklon B is a powerful insecticide using - used for disinfecting rooms. And it was already in Auschwitz, and they used it for delousing prisoners' clothes and rooms because they had a terrible problem with lice because of the inhumane conditions, not least, that prisoners were kept in.\\n\\nAnd one of the functionaries there thinks to himself, well, it's got printed on the Zyklon B cans - dangerous to life; don't go in the room while this is being let off. And he goes, well, actually, of course, if you want to kill people, they should be in the room. So he starts experimenting, not on Jews but on the sick and on Soviet prisoners of war at Auschwitz. And he starts with Zyklon B. The experiments go wrong to start with. They alter doses. They do experiments. And eventually, they evolve a different method of killing to the ones used in the death camps of Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec.\\n\\nDAVIES: Now, as you noted, Auschwitz was not originally conceived of as a death camp, but as a labor camp, which meant that it was large and had lots and lots of barracks. And you note that when the killings of Jews really accelerated in 1942 that this was done not so much at Auschwitz, but at three other camps - at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. And...\\n\\nDAVIES: They were specifically set up as death camps. And you made the point that when visitors go to those sites, they are always shocked at how small they are even though...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...These three camps alone accounted for 1.7 million deaths. Why were these deaths camps so small? How did they function?\\n\\nREES: Because they had no other function than killing. Auschwitz is unique in the history of the Nazi states, unique in the history of the world. It's not just the site of the largest mass murder the world's ever seen as a physical site. It's also unique in the Nazi state in that it's the only camp that combines two functions. It's both a concentration camp and a death camp, and those functions vary at different times in its history.\\n\\nWhat's happening at places like Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor is they are set up in 1942 - all of them open in 1942. They are set up purely to murder Jews. And if you plan on just - just, I say, just - murdering people, one of the shocking things is you need no real space at all. These places are a few hundred yards square - nothing left of them now because the Nazis themselves destroyed these camps in late 1943. They knew that they wanted to keep this their secret. And they were essentially places where trains would arrive, and the Jews would be taken off. And 99 - more than 99% of these people would be dead, probably, within two hours. So there was no stay of any kind, really, at all.\\n\\nA camp like Treblinka, which was capable of killing 300,000 people in little more - in around less than two months in the summer of 1942 - 300,000 people in that one small space - it was run by around 20 Germans and about 100 Ukrainian guards. And these Ukrainians had been mostly selected from prison camps. They had been people fighting on the Russian side who, in the horror of the prison camps that the Germans set up for these Russians where millions died, were offered this chance of saving themselves, to go and work on the German side.\\n\\nAnd then there was the third category of people working in these camps who were, tragically, Jews themselves. The Nazis selected, very occasionally, from incoming transports a number of fit Jewish people and forced them, on pain of their own immediate murder, to participate in the process by cutting people's hair, by showing the way to the gas chamber, by cleaning the gas chambers, by burning the bodies and so on. And the torment that these people went through is scarcely imaginable.\\n\\nDAVIES: So the actual horrific task of murder, of cleaning the bodies, of cleaning out the chambers after the killing has occurred is, by and large, not done by Germans.\\n\\nREES: Never done by Germans, really. No.\\n\\nDAVIES: Yeah. And that was true at Auschwitz as well.\\n\\nREES: So they end up at the huge, industrial-style killing factories of Auschwitz-Birkenau. You have a crematorium gas chamber complex that's capable, in the summer of 1941, of killing 10,000 people in one day - 10,000 people in one day. And it's run by between 2 to 4 Germans and around about 100 Jews. Now, the Nazis save the absolute moment of murder to themselves. They're the ones who drop the canisters of Zyklon B actually into the gas chamber. But pretty much all the other tasks involved in making this operate are run by Jewish Sonderkommando, who we know both from interviewing some - the few people who survived this and also from documents that Jewish Sonderkommando wrote and hid in the foundations of the building often at the time. The torment these people went through was practically indescribable.\\n\\nDAVIES: I was struck by your description of the arrival buildings at the death camps, that they often were fairly pleasant-looking, I mean, with flower plantings and the kind - I guess designed to reinsure the incoming inmates...\\n\\nDAVIES: ...That their fate was not what it was going to be.\\n\\nREES: Again, this is all part of the cynicism, but it's also part of the learning curve that the Nazis go on because what happens at Treblinka, which was the most deadly, if you like, of all of these death camps outside of Auschwitz - they were killing so many people that the system broke down - summer of 1942 - that the system broke down. There were bodies everywhere. There was just mayhem, people being shot. It was chaos.\\n\\nSo they actually had to shut it down and reorganize it. And the new commander of Treblinka, what he managed to do as he pushed it forward was come up with all of these devices like the fake railway station, fake timetables, lovely flowers - same thing happened at Sobibor. One of the most extraordinary individuals I've ever met, Toivi Blatt, who survived Sobibor, said, actually, when he got off there, he'd been expecting some horrible place. He said, it was always beautiful. And as you say, it's all designed so that when, say, Jews coming from Holland arrive, they're told, you are at a transit station, hygiene stop while - we just need to take a shower, have your hair cut and we're going to move on east. And it's deliberately designed to do that.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" We'll hear more from him after a break, and we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. Monday, January 27 is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to my 2005 interview with journalist Laurence Rees, whose book presented fresh information about Auschwitz, based on more than 100 interviews with survivors and Nazi perpetrators. It's called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\"\\n\\nDAVIES: You note that Auschwitz became, really, a death camp at a point when the Nazi death machine had become very well-developed, and Nazi initiative and ingenuity had addressed some of the technical difficulties of mass murder and had worked out solutions. Tell us a bit about those arriving Jews who were selected for immediate death. What exactly faced them, and who did the work?\\n\\nREES: Well, they would be taken from the - by the time - in 1944, by the time this became the most sophisticated procedure, they'd be taken straight from the arrival ramp, which was the area they arrived at, directly inside Birkenau. The railway line ran into the camp. They'd be taken, really, a few hundred yards round to one of four combination gas chamber-crematoriums.\\n\\nThey would then be taken down in two - cases of two of them, they'd be taken on - all on ground level. The other two - one had basement, undressing rooms and gas chambers. They'd be taken down or into a room where they'd be told to undress because they were going to have to have a shower as part of the camp's admittance procedure. And they would then be crammed into an airtight room - the door shut, locked behind them.\\n\\nAnd then either from above, in the case of the basement gas chambers or through the windows of the ones all on the ground floor, canisters of Zyklon B would be thrown in. And it would normally - it would take - dependent on how many people were in these gas chambers, dependent on the weather because Zyklon B was more effective the warmer the air was - it would take 15, 20 minutes for these people to die, I think, a horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible death of suffocation and poisoning.\\n\\nThe gas chambers would then be opened. The Sonderkommando, Jewish - other Jewish prisoners with gas masks, would have to go in, would take out the bodies, would - in the case of the adults - go through them and take out the gold teeth, would shave the hair of the women. The bodies would then be pushed into lifts taken up to the first - to the ground level or the basement gas chambers, where the bodies would be burned. And then their ashes would be collected and either thrown in the immediate area or taken down to the nearby river, Vistula. So that was the horror of the process that they devised in the end.\\n\\nDAVIES: Were many of the SS officials who conducted the murder at Auschwitz held accountable for their actions?\\n\\nREES: Well, I think this is one of the great scandals of this story, a story rich in scandal at every level. But this is one of the greater scandals, which is that less than - well, maybe, 12%, 10% of SS people who worked at Auschwitz were ever prosecuted. Around 90% of the SS who worked at Auschwitz during the war escaped all forms of prosecution. And myself, I think that's a scandal.\\n\\nDAVIES: Why was that?\\n\\nREES: One of the reasons that so few people were prosecuted was that by the 1960s, the German prosecutors had taken the view that unless a member of the SS was absolutely directly involved in the killing or had been directly involved in acts of brutality - physical brutality - then they could get off scot-free. And of course, it meant that the way that the gas chambers had been devised, which was that so few Germans were needed for their actual physical operation, it meant that the vast majority of SS at the camp could say, oh, I wasn't really directly involved in the killing at all.\\n\\nNow, myself, I think that's a calamity. That's terrible because, of course, if you're working in the currency units counting out money, if you're working in the SS transport division, if you're a guard at the camp, you are directly involved in the operation of the camp that results - that's an extermination center. So I certainly disagree with - you know, for all the good it's going to do anybody that I disagree, but I certainly disagree that they took that view.\\n\\nDAVIES: In this book, you compare the crimes of the Holocaust to other mass exterminations in history - going as far back as Genghis Khan's genocide in Persia - and conclude that this represents the lowest act in human history and should not be allowed to recede into distant memory as some of these other mass killings have. What's different about this extermination?\\n\\nREES: I think that if you're looking at how you should think about events in the past - or even events in the present, actually - what you've got to do is look at the overall circumstances in which these things happen. You know, it's not much good thinking, well, oh, the Vikings were terrible. Well, the Vikings operated in a system of values at the time that was - they were, by all accounts from latest research on Vikings, for example, scarcely better or worse than any other 10th century marauding hordes. I mean, it's a ludicrous - it seems to me a ludicrous way to go to start blaming Vikings for being Vikings.\\n\\nSomething different is going on here. What's happening is that you are taking a cultured nation at the heart of Europe in the 20th century, long after the Enlightenment, that has adopted absolute civilized cultural values in the wake of the end of the first world war. It is a thriving, although troubled, democracy. Its take - it's got rid of all legislation against Jews. It's liberal in that regard. All of these things are going on. It's got a great written culture. It's got a great musical culture. It's got a great artistic culture. It's the place you would think would be the most civilized almost to be. And yet that very place, within a matter of years, turns into this.\\n\\nSo you've got a journey that they go on that's unlike - and it's not like the journey the Vikings go on or Genghis Khan or the plains goes on. This is not like that. This is a different journey. This is a journey from one pole - one extreme, if you like, to the other extreme. And in the process, they use 20th-century technology that they warp and adapt to this very service of mass killing. And unlike Stalin, who even at his worst, when he was deporting entire nations - the Kalmyk nations, the Crimean Tatars and so on. He's deporting whole nations to Siberia. Even Stalin isn't trying to put forward measures to eliminate them in their entirety. So something different, I think, is going on here.\\n\\nDAVIES: So many students of Nazism and the Holocaust have tried to in some way answer the question, how could this happen? You've interviewed a hundred or so survivors and war criminals from Auschwitz. Do you feel you have some new insights into that question?\\n\\nREES: I think what surprised me about this - because I never intended this career (laughter). Like, this kind of happened to me, you know, that I've been - written so much on this and made so many programs on this. And one of the reasons it's happened is because I keep thinking I'm getting close to being able to answer that properly. And as I - as I keep getting towards it, it keeps going away from me a bit more. So I think I'm a long way down the road, I hope, to being able to get to there. But I'm not there yet. Maybe it's absolutely impossible to get there.\\n\\nBut one thing I took from this was a big fear I've now got about people of absolute faith. I always thought faith of itself was - could only be a positive thing. Everyone talks about the importance of having faith. Well, these guys had faith, absolute faith. And there's one really desperately upsetting - all desperately upsetting. But ideologically, there's one desperately particularly upsetting moment where - in the book where I talk about how Himmler and Hoss most admired, as prisoners, Jehovah's Witnesses. They pointed to them and said, see that faith? That's the kind of faith we need in our fuhrer - absolute, unshakable faith.\\n\\nNow, of course, no one is equating what the Nazis did with Jehovah's Witnesses, who operate a whole creed of peace and love and so on. Absolutely. But the very notion of absolute faith is at the core of this. And so I'm beginning to start to have questions about people who - or communities that are absolutely certain about things.\\n\\nDAVIES: Well, Laurence Rees, thanks so much for speaking with us.\\n\\nREES: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nDAVIES: Laurence Rees' book is called \\\"Auschwitz: A New History.\\\" After a break, we'll hear some of Terry's 1988 interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: Today we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Next, we'll hear Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016 at the age of 87. Wiesel was born in what was then Romania and was 15 when he and his family were sent from Hungary to Auschwitz in 1944. He was later moved to another camp, Buchenwald, from which he was liberated in 1945. Among his family, only two of his sisters survived the war.\\n\\nWiesel became one of the first survivors to devote his life to bearing witness to the Holocaust. His memoir, \\\"Night,\\\" was published in English in 1960, and he spent the rest of his life speaking about social injustice. Terry spoke with him in 1988 when his novel \\\"Twilight\\\" was published.\\n\\nTERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Why have you made it your life work to bear witness?\\n\\nELIE WIESEL: What else could one do, having gone through certain events? I believe a human being, if he or she wants to remain human, then he or she must do something with what we have seen, endured, witnessed. Not to live through an experience, but the experience is there - it's bad, but not to communicate it is worse.\\n\\nGROSS: You know, I think that it's almost a human instinct to let time dim memories of horror and tragedy. Have you fought that in a way? Have you tried to keep those memories alive so that you can continue to communicate about them?\\n\\nWIESEL: Naturally. I mean, naturally, the human being wants to forget pain. In this case, although, for most of those who went through the experience during the war, they want to remember more and more and more. They go deep into their own consciousness, into their own memory, trying to find more events, more faces, more eyes, more words, more sighs, more tears, more agonies. It's never enough because we feel that we have to tell the story, and no one can tell the story fully.\\n\\nGROSS: You once described Auschwitz as the defeat of the intellect that wants to find a meaning, with a capital M, in history. Do you feel that, nevertheless, you've been really spending your life trying to find some meaning of the Holocaust, some larger meaning you could tell us about man or about God?\\n\\nWIESEL: I'll tell you, all the questions I had remain open. I really don't believe that I found any answer to any one of the questions I had. I don't know the meaning. I don't know why it happened. I don't know how it happened. I still don't know anything, really. I'm trying to tell a story, and even the story cannot be told. And therefore, it cannot be communicated, and therefore, people - and deep down, I know - won't receive the testimony that we are giving. We are a very special kind of writers, those who write about that event. And I write very little about it, really. But I know that people cannot understand.\\n\\nGROSS: I think when you were in the camps, you saw some religious people stop praying and saw people who had not been observant turn to God. You had been very observant and very immersed in the religious texts when you were young, before you were deported to the concentration camps. How did your experiences and your survival in the camps change your own experience of religion?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, the change - to the extent that it occurred - did not occur there. It's afterwards that the problems became urgent. Inside that universe, we continued praying. We continued believing. We continued affirming. We needed that link with our past. It's only after the war that I began asking questions, and I began articulating a certain protest. And that protest is still with me. I am still angry at all the forces in history that provoked such a catastrophe. That doesn't mean that my faith left me or that I left fate. I try to develop a certain protest within fate.\\n\\nGROSS: Have you gone back to the religious texts that you were reading when you were young?\\n\\nWIESEL: I never stopped reading or studying. Even inside that universe, I studied. I had a teacher there with name I never knew and whose face I hardly saw. But he was a teacher, the head of a Talmudic school in Galicia. And we work together, and we studied together. I know. It's incredible.\\n\\nGROSS: This is in the camps.\\n\\nWIESEL: Inside - in Auschwitz. So we studied. They kept on studying from morning to evening. And after the war, the first thing I wanted was a book, was a Talmudic treatise. I never stopped studying. That probably saved me.\\n\\nGROSS: In your first novel, \\\"Night...\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: \\\"Night\\\" was not a novel. It was a memoir.\\n\\nGROSS: I don't know why I think of it as a novel.\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Every word...\\n\\nGROSS: I think of think of it as a very autobiographical novel, but...\\n\\nGROSS: Yeah. Well, I - then I guess I was going to ask you about your religious teacher who narrowly escaped from being murdered with hundreds or thousands of other Jews in the forest by the SS. And he somehow managed to escape and come back to your village to warn people about what was happening, and no one would listen.\\n\\nWIESEL: We didn't listen because he was a simple man. He was a beetle. Had he been an important person, I think some people would have listened. What is so extraordinary is when we remember today the silence, the indifference of so many people who were not inside the tragedy but on the other side, just imagine if we had heard on the radio Ben-Gurion from Israel or Roosevelt or Churchill telling Hungarian Jews don't go because they are killing. They're massacring. I think they would have believed them. But why should one believe a beetle, a man who came back from the other side and was telling such atrocious stories?\\n\\nGROSS: We're getting back to the question of madness. I think a lot of people in your village just assumed he'd lost his mind and was making up - you know, was having visions or something, that this couldn't possibly have happened.\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, absolutely. I myself - I was very close to him. And we spent many, many hours alone together every evening. And I would listen to him. Plus, I love to listen to stories, even to his stories, maybe especially to hear stories. But I didn't believe them.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\\n\\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We're listening to Terry's interview with Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel recorded in 1988. Wiesel died in 2016.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you do anything to mentally prepare for what was in store when your father told you that the next day the whole village was going to be deported, the whole ghetto was going to be deported?\\n\\nWIESEL: No. We didn't know. See; Hungarian Jewry was deported at such a pace. Everything came so fast. The Hungarians allowed the Germans to come in in March. The end of May, all the Jews were out already in Germany. In less than six weeks, Eichmann had managed to deport to their death more than 600,000 Jews - men, women and children. So it came very fast. And it ended very fast. We didn't have time to think.\\n\\nGROSS: You've described yourself as having been very weak and sickly when you were young. I know you think of yourself as having survived purely by chance. Did you learn things, though, to help you survive when you were in the camps?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, no. Not at all. I was the wrong person, the wrong candidate for survival. I was always weak, as you said, and disarmed, cowardly. I would never try to do anything, which was not what I could have done or should have done. I never asked for a supplement of anything. I didn't volunteer. I was always pleased to think that I could be invisible. Not to make myself visible was my task. I don't know why I survived. I don't know how I survived. It was really by accident.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you know when you got out of the camps that you wanted to write?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, I knew that I was going to write before I entered the camps. I come from a tradition, from the Jewish tradition, we believe - which believes in words, in language, in communication. And already at the age of 12 or 13, I was writing. Of course, it wasn't good. It meant nothing, but I tried to write. I even found the manuscript. I went back to my hometown. It's not good. But I tried.\\n\\nAfterwards, I knew I would have to bear witness. Everyone who was there is a witness, and everyone who was there is a true witness. Others who are trying to speak about this subject occasionally are false witnesses. And I felt that I had to be a true witness. And therefore, I decided to wait for 10 years, not to speak about it but to use language related to these experiences until I knew that the words were true words.\\n\\nGROSS: Why 10 years? Why not five years? Why not one year? No, seriously. What made you think..\\n\\nGROSS: ...That 10 years is what you needed to really know what it was you wanted to say and what words you wanted to say it with?\\n\\nWIESEL: Well, 10 is a biblical figure, I know. And the - it's a good figure, why not? I cannot tell you that I got up one morning and decided that - let's see, that five or six or seven. It entered my mind - it has to be 10. I decided 10.\\n\\nGROSS: Did you actually have an anniversary where like...\\n\\nGROSS: And that day you sat down to write.\\n\\nGROSS: And is that when you started to write \\\"Night?\\\"\\n\\nWIESEL: I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" yes. That's when I wrote \\\"Night,\\\" on April 11, 1955, which is 10 years later.\\n\\nGROSS: And looking back, do you think that this was definitely the right thing to do, to wait those 10 years? In what ways were you changed as a witness and as a writer during those 10 years?\\n\\nWIESEL: Maybe I didn't change, but the words in me changed. They grew. you know, Words have strange destiny, too. They grow, they get old, they die, they come back. Words can be turned into spears. They can be turned into prayers. It's a strange world that you are in when you deal with words.\\n\\nGROSS: In one of your essays, you wrote that after the war, you deliberately avoided all contact with Germans and that their presence sickened you physically. Did that change? And if so, what changed that?\\n\\nWIESEL: It did. But I didn't want to go back to Germany, really. I went once because I didn't want to judge people. I went once in the early '60s to do a piece for commentary. And I realized that every person I see in the street, I judge him or her asking, where was he, what did he do, how old is he, could I - could he have been there? And I didn't want that role, so I didn't go back. But I did go back last year in '86, '87.\\n\\nToday, you have a young generation of Germans. And I do not believe in collective guilt. So I have absolutely no problem with the young Germans. I even feel sorry for the young Germans because to be maybe sons or daughters of killers is different than to be sons and daughters of the victims. And I felt sorry for them. I still do.\\n\\nGROSS: The generations of survivors are getting older. The older generation of survivors is no longer with us. Are you concerned about what's going to happen after the generations of survivors pass on, like, who will be around to actually speak the memories?\\n\\nWIESEL: Oh, I'm profoundly concerned, naturally. In one of my novels, I try to describe that feeling of the last survivor, what it means to be the very last. And I would not want to be that last survivor. But on the other hand, we are leaving a legacy. We are bequeathing a certain message, a certain story. This tragedy is the most documented tragedy in recorded history. And therefore later on, if there will be a later on, anyone wishing to know will know where to go for knowledge.\\n\\nDAVIES: Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel speaking with Terry Gross in 1988. Wiesel died in 2016 at the age of 87.\\n\\nOn Monday's show, how our military leaders think about the unthinkable. Journalist Fred Kaplan says President Trump's threat to rain fire and fury on North Korea has made many Americans consider the prospect of nuclear war for the first time in decades. His new book explores how our leaders have planned for and sometimes narrowly avoided nuclear conflict. The book is called \\\"The Bomb.\\\" Hope you can join us.\\n\\nFRESH AIR's executive producer is Danny Miller. Our senior producer today is Sam Briger. For Terry Gross, I'm Dave Davies.\\n\\nWe'll end today's show with music from the album \\\"Chamber Music From Theresienstadt,\\\" performed by the Hawthorne String Quartet. Theresienstadt was a camp designed by the Nazis to look like a paradise ghetto to mislead the world about their Final Solution for the Jewish people. It was actually a waystation to the death camps. This is from Viktor Ullmann's \\\"Third String Quartet,\\\" which he composed at Theresienstadt.

It's just enough to kick things into gear.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen I work out,\\u201d she continued. \\u201cAfter that, at second breakfast, I joke that I eat dinner for breakfast. It's a full meal with chicken, grains, and saut\\u00e9ed or roasted vegetables.\\u201d\\n\\nDwayne \\u2018The Rock\\u2019 Johnson is known for being one of the most muscular men in Hollywood, but all that muscle mass requires a ton of protein to maintain.\\n\\nTo that end, The Rock told People he typically has between 10-12 oz. of roasted potatoes, 8-10 oz. of grilled sirloin and 4-6 scrambled egg whites.\\n\\nInstead of coffee, he told People he prefers \\u201cenergy drink powders that I like to mix up.\\u201d Delicious...\\n\\nHe shared a picture on Instagram in 2015 of a different variation on his breakfast, which includes cream on rice with blueberries, English muffins, eggs, turkey bacon and grilled buffalo.\\n\\nShailene Woodley is known for trying out natural remedies and treatments that you\\u2019re likely to find in Goop, so it\\u2019s no surprise her breakfast of choice is a little unusual.\\n\\nBesides her daily teaspoon of clay (don\\u2019t ask), she said on The Late Show with David Letterman she\\u2019s a big fan of bone broth.\\n\\nClaiming it helped with a \\u201cleaky gut\\u201d, she said, \\u201cWhat I think is beautiful about [it] is you utilise the whole animal. You're not just seeking out that perfect cut of muscle meat.\\u201d\\n\\nShe added, \\u201cI just make my freak concoction that everyone thinks is weird and eat it.\\u201d\\n\\nCynthia Nixon: The \\u201cstrangest bagel of all time\\u201d\\n\\nCynthia Nixon\\u2019s controversial bagel order was called many things last year: a \\u201ccrime against the bagel gods\\u201d, \\u201cbasically criminal\\u201d and a \\u201chorrifying example of globalism.\\u201d\\n\\nHer bagel of choice went viral last year when the Gothamist revealed the once hopeful candidate for Governor of New York had ordered a cinnamon raisin bagel slathered in lox, cream cheese, red onions, capers and tomatoes.\\n\\nThe moment was filmed by Gothamist, in which Nixon was seen talking to a member of staff and doubling down on her order.\\n\\nAs a concerned bagel maker double checked if she really wanted it, she continued, \\u201cThat\\u2019s what I want - a full load.\\u201d\\n\\nShe did curb her craving by assuring that she wanted \\u201cplain\\u201d cream cheese, she also said with full confidence that the bagel was \\u201csweet and salty\\u201d.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s no surprise Chrissy Teigen does breakfast right, given that the former model has penned numerous cookbooks.\\n\\nIn 2015, she shared a snap of what she had for breakfast: namely \\u201clow and creamy eggs, garlic roasted bacon and burst tomatoes\\u201d.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a much classier take on your standard eggs and bacon and she shared the recipe if you\\u2019re keen on upgrading your breakfast game.\\n\\nThe recipe included mixing ten eggs with a \\u201chearty splash\\u201d of heavy cream, salt and pepper before cooking it over low in tablespoon of both olive oil and butter.\\n\\nShe advised her fans to constantly stir their eggs while cooking and also said, \\u201cThe bacon is roasted at 400 for 10-15 mins with chopped garlic cloves on a baking sheet and tomatoes tossed in olive oil and shaken in a hot pan for a bit.\\u201d\\n\\nSpeaking to Shape magazine, she said, \\u201cI have to have breakfast and breakfast has to be eggs, whether in omelette form, hard-boiled, or over-easy.\\u201d\\n\\nGiven Legend is married to chef extraordinaire Chrissy Teigen, the singer has picked up a few tips along the way.\\n\\nAccording to The Happy Foodie, who shared a recipe for \\u201cJohn Legend\\u2019s breakfast sandwich\\u201d featured in his wife's cookbook Cravings, the singer said, \\u201cThe first song I wrote directly inspired by Chrissy was a song called 'Good Morning', from my album Evolver. That song is not about making her a breakfast sandwich.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s about making . . . something else,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cBut she LOVES my breakfast sandwich. And I LOVE good mornings. So the a.m. is a wonderful time in our house. Enjoy!\\u201d\\n\\nThe sandwich isn\\u2019t for those looking for a healthy start however, as it includes creating your own sausage patties from pork, brown sugar, sage, red pepper flakes, frying those up and slapping them onto buttered English muffins. They\\u2019re then topped off with slices of cheese and a squeeze of Sriracha.\", \"author\": \"Megan C.

(majorly revised and updated). The full text is strongly encouraged; but two Summaries have been published for fast-trackers. This more detailed one, for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose, and a Text Summary for those who prefer a more general sweep. Both provide a means for seeing \\u201c5G\\u201d more clearly, and quickly accessing areas of particular interest.\\n\\nWhen you say, \\u201c5G\\u201d or \\u201dStop 5G,\\u201d please be sure you haven\\u2019t been misled about what it is, what you are opposing \\u2013 or want. Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts. This article attempts to raise some \\u2018dust\\u2019 and clear the air at the same time.\\n\\nBecause carrier rollouts and stories of harm are major opposition concerns, much detail is given to show how \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria makes things worse in various cases. Safety testing, history of official awareness of harm, and opposition priorities are also discussed.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Hysterical opposition to \\u201c5G\\u201d has created dangerous misconception, beginning with careless misuse of the very term \\u201c5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 When most people say \\u201c5G\\u201d they refer to its \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation, often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This is inaccurate, confusing and dangerous. EHF and 5G EHF are specified.\\n\\u2022 At least 4 Important distinctions must be kept in mind for understanding and discussing \\u201c5G,\\u201d especially one between the two 5G\\u2019s \\u2013 high frequency 5G and mid-band to low-band 5G.\\n\\u2022 Some terms are suggested to clear confusion and enhance discussion. \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d houses antennas. A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\u2022 Common, confusing warnings are discussed: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The term \\u201csmall cell\\u201d is misused, being applied to enclosures and/or fixtures instead of the area covered by antenna range. 5Gmmw has short range, thus its cell is small. \\u2018Making cases\\u2019.\\n\\u2022 MMW easily blocked, even by leaves and heavy rain, gets worse with increasing frequency requiring more fixture locations. Hysteria rarely notes that 5Gmlb is a large cell and is not blocked.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density. Common warnings about implementation are in serious question at this writing (more later).\\n\\u2022 Small cells are not new, not created for \\u201c5G\\u201d. There are traditionally three kinds.\\n\\u2022 From the outset: Opposition implies 5G is small cells/MMW. Typically careless statement given as example.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cThe skin\\u2019s sweat ducts act as receiving antennas for 5G\\u201d is speculative, based on a stretched interpretation of an Israeli study. Study details reviewed. Wording of its \\u201cwarning-flag\\u201d conclusion applies conceptually to all G\\u2019s. Harm was known decades before 2G (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\u2022 Insufficient correlation to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas. Making cases?\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G is a weapon\\u201d is based carelessly on the military\\u2019s ADS system that heats the skin. No correlation with commercial 5G mobile. MMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G.\\n\\u2022 2G began as a military weapon and was adapted to telecom. Entire wireless telecom system is a weapon.\\n\\u2022 All telecom/WiFi wireless frequencies, 2G-4G, will cook you at sufficiently high power levels. Telecom 5Gmmw at commercial levels will not.\\n\\u2022 A powerful Air Force radar system, Pave Paws, will cook you in a nanosecond at 450 MHz, so forget whine about \\u201c5G weapon.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 No ADS power range found, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study.\\n\\u2022 Power of microwave ovens and towers/phones compared. ADS configuration chosen to limit penetration depth.\\n\\u2022 No wattage output for 5G MLB or MMW antennas found, but did find Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of a 5Gmmw antenna for 28 and 38 GHz and compared with FCC standard.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G\\u201d per se opposition creates dangerous false sense of security encouraging continued use of pathological 3G/4G/WiFi wireless devices. Techno-humans adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G has not been safety tested\\u201d is a ploy. That the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d atrocities, whereas, the basic issue is wireless tech per se.\\n\\u2022 In 1996, FCC finally adopted ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992, covering frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range all MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019.\\n\\u2022 FCC assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is same fraud used to make assurances about 3G in 1996: \\u201cNo heat, no harm.\\u201d This author warned of this response to \\u201cStop 5G\\u201d in the 2/2019 article Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised?\\n\\u2022 Huge volume of science beginning in the 1950s brings up question whether *proper* testing was ever done.\\n\\u2022 FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science. This blatant criminality is clearly revealed by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 \\u201cCurrent FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d All official testing is fraud, can\\u2019t be \\u201coutdated.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 \\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing can exist.\\n\\u2022 More detail on the original testing cited two in sections of Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\u2022 Where infrastructure is concerned, emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA.\\u2019 But things seem to be developing differently. Even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\u2022 A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard covers two frequency ranges, FR1, FR2. One, for current bands below 6 GHz (3G/4G, i.e., 5Gmlb). Two, for 5Gmmw. WiFi remains separate for now\\n\\u2022 5G NR defines new protocols for MLB, providing at least 35% more 4G speed, while being called 5G without distinction. 5Gmlb can use same towers as 4G, has same range and penetration, but new antennas.\\n\\u2022 5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention, including \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and beamforming (more later).\\n\\u2022 Plans being made to market 5G in an unlicensed 3.5 GHz band of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service. MLB called 5G.\\n\\u2022 Apparently, current smartphones can be updated to process 5Gmlb; but 5Gmmw will require new (expensive) phones. Field tests: Samsung Galaxy S10 (good shot of 5Gmmw antenna/node in first article). Both advise \\u2018holding off\\u2019 on new, 5G phones.\\n\\u2022 Two possible motives behind \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria are addressed.\\n\\u2022 Two dissections of news stories causing 5G rollout confusion \\u2013 the UK\\u2019s 6/26/19 Glastonbury Festival and a notable 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland. Neither report clarifies which \\u201c5G\\u201d was involved.\\n\\u2022 Glastonbury protest article laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated hysteria that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Implied is that 2G-4G were not experiments. Paradox: They were and were not. Distinctions must be made.\\n\\u2022 Crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s.\\n\\u2022 Decision made long ago to put life/people at risk (see History of Official Awareness).Thus, thus the yes/no experiment is not IF harm, but when, and how the explosion will play out.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cGood\\u201d news: Human health collapse could be prevented \\u2013 by ecosystem collapse. Race is on.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s happening \\u2018on the ground.\\u2019 The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon.\\n\\u2022 Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. Verizon says this is MMW (5Gmmw). But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sacramento seems a most enthusiastic host. Website features Verizon UWB installation at citizen\\u2019s home, City officials attending. Sacramento also prides itself on attaining \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more below).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas \\u2013 could be its final destination.\\n\\u2022 Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason, with 3G/4G still operating. Again, the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\u2022 The forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. Drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for millions of closely spaced fixtures nationwide. There now seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\u2022 A report on new Qualcomm smartphone 5Gmmw antennas also covers antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\u2022 It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) is specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs say 4G can handle it. Probably 4Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 Some opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. The attempted deployment of smart utility meters on (4G) WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say.\\n\\u2022 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\u2022 I didn\\u2019t invest time trying to find where dense fixture locations are happening in neighborhoods. Rollout info suggests only populous areas. Readers who\\u2019ve seen this anywhere are asked to share in Comments.\\n\\u2022 If FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose.\\n\\u2022 Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams said in an interview that FLD is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d True, but not the whole truth. McAdam touted 5Gmmw for Smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality.\\n\\u2022 No matter the 5G version, wireless per se is the foundation for managing/controlling every aspect of daily life with \\u201cSmart\\u201d technology.\\n\\u2022 None of the above means things can\\u2019t change. MLB rollout could be precursor to an FLD/MMW invasion or satellite saturation in outlying areas. Speculation on MMW future and interface between ground and satellite purposes and services.\\n\\u2022 Parenthetical discussion of Sacramento-City web page showing total-surveillance/human-control system rapidly gestating under auspices of \\u201cSmart City for public safety/benefits\\u201d \\u2013 especially \\u201cProjects in Progress\\u201d. Note promise of \\u201cSTEM,\\u201d the nationwide programming for turning kids into corporate plug-ins.\\n\\u2022 STEM promises techno-shiny future, and exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. But the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum of the latter. Imagine the potential chaos once a Smart City become hackers target.\\n\\u2022 Mostly confusion in these reports, all implying 5Gmmw. No clear indication of which \\u201c5G\\u201d is involved in most cases \\u2013 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 People see new infrastructure and assume MMW.\\n\\u2022 All harms reported thus far are classic 2G-4G symptoms. Most are the \\u201cElectrohypersensitivity (EHS) type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\u2022 RF meters have been used to support claims of harm, but ordinary meters can\\u2019t read MMW. Such meters are professional, expensive, technical equipment.\\n\\u2022 A true 5G phone would ID MMW and MLB, but no meter shows frequencies, so even a pro one wouldn\\u2019t reveal which frequencies are present.\\n\\u2022 Long-term previous exposure plays into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Harm \\u201cverified\\u201d by ordinary meters proves 4G harm, one way or another.\\n\\u2022 One hawker claims its ordinary meter can read \\u201c5G,\\u201d a ruse brought to you by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 For most situations, meters not much use for most people \\u2013 no safe exposure level (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Meters sometimes useful for people using shielding, etc, but symptom improvement doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops..\\n\\u2022 Differences between MMW effects and long-reported classic 2G-4G effects can tentatively identify 5G frequency type.\\n\\u2022 MMW potentially threatens skin and eyes. A study irresponsibly (underhandedly?) cited in an article to prove \\u201c5G\\u201d has heart effects is exposed.\\n\\u2022 Study also implies that any microwave frequency at sufficient power can cook and kill you.\\n\\u2022 Possible, but still speculative, that 5Gmmw can cause MLB effects, because conductive body tissues can carry induced currents deep into the body.\\n\\u2022 MIMO (\\u2018my-mo\\u2019) antenna tech has been used for MLB for more than a decade. The new development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, or many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming beams of radiation.\\n\\u2022 One question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose a greater threat than traditional antennas. It\\u2019s possible. It seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of beams, although a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\u2022 Aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying beams avoids high power output per beam.\\n\\u2022 Hysteria often warns of an outrageously high increase in power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d For a few reasons, this seems unlikely.\\n\\u2022 Details of several typical news reports. Most demonstrate fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower will make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one, a general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\u2022 Story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from Verizon antenna installed near home illustrates confusion. Testimony before Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with mayor present.\\n\\u2022 Type of antenna not given, but probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\u2022 Strange that testimony date precedes stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests. Maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\u2022 Opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that mean? Incident suggests MMW effect, but still shows need to know what you mean when you say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although she commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but her suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness won\\u2019t be taken seriously.\\n\\u2022 Typically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\u2022 Even if new 5Gmlb antennas pose greater health risk, it\\u2019s academic, because the \\u2018pre-5G\\u2019 endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal.\\n\\u2022 Outrageous opposition-induced hysteria from Gateshead in UK about \\u201c5G\\u201d from street lights. Dangers of LED lights cited.\\n\\u2022 News report from Cincinnati shows folks in the dark about 5G, thanks to hysteria. Story from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, shows better awareness of wireless threat. Both show dangerous thinking about shutting down/moving tower (no one talking ecosystem).\\n\\u2022 An RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story, is cited as accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\u2022 Original 9/20/19 story (now includes update) a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria. No one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers previously. It\\u2019s a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that people fear will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d..\\n\\u2022 9/27/19 update shows interview with concerned nurse. \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacks understanding of wireless, will feel safer if that tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\u2022 Tall, new-look tower with cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video). Looks nothing like Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw antenna seen in phone report in the 5G Rollouts section.\\n\\u2022 Update also says it\\u2019s a Sprint tower, so can\\u2019t be MMW. \\u201c5G\\u201d fear an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s in cylindrical fixture and its specific functions are anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\u2022 Update also notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what?\\n\\u2022 3/12/19 San Joaquin report also concerns tall tower with cylindrical fixture \\u201ctoo close to school.\\u201d No 5G fear, more general awareness of wireless danger. \\u2018Cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\u2022 Three teachers and four students with various cancers since 2016 Also 22 year-old former male student. No mention of whether teachers and young man were exposed to any other towers/devices. Just that nasty tower\\u2026\\n\\u2022 Ripon case interesting for several reasons. Independent expert contradicted official assurance that tower tested OK. Shows common ignorance: \\u201c\\u2026kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sprint shut tower down, agreed to relocate. Good PR, suggests industry/towns will back down.\\n\\u2022 Two more reasons: First is overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure and probably cumulative effect (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Second reason, bogus advice \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the argument for slow death over quicker death, or futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can make things worse.\\n\\u2022 Any antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\u2022 Reducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usage tips and lower exposure limits. Both futile.\\n\\u2022 Reliance on power level to determine safety is largely a convenience, not science. Several other factors make determination too complex. They keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\u2022 Harm stories indicate people seem to think it just happened. Fatal error. Felt or not, effects can occur any time during or after exposure, so no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway.\\n\\u2022 An organization called EHS Idaho collects reports on incidence and effects in the Idaho population of electrohypersensitivity (EHS). Term misleading. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 suggested.\\n\\u2022 An estimated 35% of the Idaho population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. As bad as this is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad as things could quickly and easily get. Call this \\u201cpre-terminal disaster.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Illness caused by wireless radiation not new or unique to it, even though lists and categories of issues attributed to it.\\n\\u2022 Question: how much of today\\u2019s ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 all known prior to wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to wireless tech (or even the whole range of RF we \\u2019bathe\\u2019 in)?\\n\\u2022 If officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\u2022 For sick users \\u2014 much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\u2022 But quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\u2022 Manifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere.\\n\\u2022 If we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. I Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\u2022 One historical document acknowledging harm FCC denies is 1981 WHO report, Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973.\\n\\u2022 Very long report covers frequencies from 100 KHz to 300 GHz, but telecom/WiFi harm for last three decades has come from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\u2022 Quotes from document summary given, revealing ruthless deception. It\\u2019s all most people need to read. Section 1.1.6. admits safe level should be \\u201c\\u2026close to natural background levels\\u201d. Natural background microwave is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed).\\n\\nSo there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit after all: zero.\\n\\u2022 Safety \\u201cnot technically feasible.\\u201d Assumption that technology more important than environment and human health.\\n\\u2022 Notes and quotes from a presentation at 2009 Whole Health Expo reveal knowledge of harm since the 1950s.

One thing is certain about most technology, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\u2022 Threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about process of creating it..\\n\\u2022 From resource acquisition (especially mining) to disposal, technology is toxic to planet and biosphere.

There is an appeal to \\u2018stop 5G in space\\u2019, but popular emphasis remains disproportionately on ground installations.\\n\\u2022 Arrogant FCC has flatly dismissed legitimate concerns raised by NASA, NOAA and more. Does such arrogance suggest level of power beyond corporate/governmental?\\n\\u2022 Might such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates?\\n\\u2022 Best way to beat 5G on the ground is to reject all current wireless (3G/4G) at the commercial level. This could well impact satellites also.\\n\\u2022 Outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the ones on earthbound antennas.\\n\\u2022 Taking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\u2022 The race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse.

(majorly revised and updated). The full text is strongly encouraged; but two Summaries have been published for fast-trackers. This more detailed one, for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose, and a Text Summary for those who prefer a more general sweep. Both provide a means for seeing \\u201c5G\\u201d more clearly, and quickly accessing areas of particular interest.\\n\\nWhen you say, \\u201c5G\\u201d or \\u201dStop 5G,\\u201d please be sure you haven\\u2019t been misled about what it is, what you are opposing \\u2013 or want. Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts. This article attempts to raise some \\u2018dust\\u2019 and clear the air at the same time.\\n\\nBecause carrier rollouts and stories of harm are major opposition concerns, much detail is given to show how \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria makes things worse in various cases. Safety testing, history of official awareness of harm, and opposition priorities are also discussed.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Hysterical opposition to \\u201c5G\\u201d has created dangerous misconception, beginning with careless misuse of the very term \\u201c5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 When most people say \\u201c5G\\u201d they refer to its \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation, often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This is inaccurate, confusing and dangerous. EHF and 5G EHF are specified.\\n\\u2022 At least 4 Important distinctions must be kept in mind for understanding and discussing \\u201c5G,\\u201d especially one between the two 5G\\u2019s \\u2013 high frequency 5G and mid-band to low-band 5G.\\n\\u2022 Some terms are suggested to clear confusion and enhance discussion. \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d houses antennas. A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\u2022 Common, confusing warnings are discussed: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The term \\u201csmall cell\\u201d is misused, being applied to enclosures and/or fixtures instead of the area covered by antenna range. 5Gmmw has short range, thus its cell is small. \\u2018Making cases\\u2019.\\n\\u2022 MMW easily blocked, even by leaves and heavy rain, gets worse with increasing frequency requiring more fixture locations. Hysteria rarely notes that 5Gmlb is a large cell and is not blocked.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density. Common warnings about implementation are in serious question at this writing (more later).\\n\\u2022 Small cells are not new, not created for \\u201c5G\\u201d. There are traditionally three kinds.\\n\\u2022 From the outset: Opposition implies 5G is small cells/MMW. Typically careless statement given as example.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cThe skin\\u2019s sweat ducts act as receiving antennas for 5G\\u201d is speculative, based on a stretched interpretation of an Israeli study. Study details reviewed. Wording of its \\u201cwarning-flag\\u201d conclusion applies conceptually to all G\\u2019s. Harm was known decades before 2G (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\u2022 Insufficient correlation to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas. Making cases?\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G is a weapon\\u201d is based carelessly on the military\\u2019s ADS system that heats the skin. No correlation with commercial 5G mobile. MMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G.\\n\\u2022 2G began as a military weapon and was adapted to telecom. Entire wireless telecom system is a weapon.\\n\\u2022 All telecom/WiFi wireless frequencies, 2G-4G, will cook you at sufficiently high power levels. Telecom 5Gmmw at commercial levels will not.\\n\\u2022 A powerful Air Force radar system, Pave Paws, will cook you in a nanosecond at 450 MHz, so forget whine about \\u201c5G weapon.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 No ADS power range found, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study.\\n\\u2022 Power of microwave ovens and towers/phones compared. ADS configuration chosen to limit penetration depth.\\n\\u2022 No wattage output for 5G MLB or MMW antennas found, but did find Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of a 5Gmmw antenna for 28 and 38 GHz and compared with FCC standard.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G\\u201d per se opposition creates dangerous false sense of security encouraging continued use of pathological 3G/4G/WiFi wireless devices. Techno-humans adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G has not been safety tested\\u201d is a ploy. That the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d atrocities, whereas, the basic issue is wireless tech per se.\\n\\u2022 In 1996, FCC finally adopted ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992, covering frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range all MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019.\\n\\u2022 FCC assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is same fraud used to make assurances about 3G in 1996: \\u201cNo heat, no harm.\\u201d This author warned of this response to \\u201cStop 5G\\u201d in the 2/2019 article Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised?\\n\\u2022 Huge volume of science beginning in the 1950s brings up question whether *proper* testing was ever done.\\n\\u2022 FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science. This blatant criminality is clearly revealed by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 \\u201cCurrent FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d All official testing is fraud, can\\u2019t be \\u201coutdated.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 \\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing can exist.\\n\\u2022 More detail on the original testing cited two in sections of Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\u2022 Where infrastructure is concerned, emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA.\\u2019 But things seem to be developing differently. Even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\u2022 A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard covers two frequency ranges, FR1, FR2. One, for current bands below 6 GHz (3G/4G, i.e., 5Gmlb). Two, for 5Gmmw. WiFi remains separate for now\\n\\u2022 5G NR defines new protocols for MLB, providing at least 35% more 4G speed, while being called 5G without distinction. 5Gmlb can use same towers as 4G, has same range and penetration, but new antennas.\\n\\u2022 5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention, including \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and beamforming (more later).\\n\\u2022 Plans being made to market 5G in an unlicensed 3.5 GHz band of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service. MLB called 5G.\\n\\u2022 Apparently, current smartphones can be updated to process 5Gmlb; but 5Gmmw will require new (expensive) phones. Field tests: Samsung Galaxy S10 (good shot of 5Gmmw antenna/node in first article). Both advise \\u2018holding off\\u2019 on new, 5G phones.\\n\\u2022 Two possible motives behind \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria are addressed.\\n\\u2022 Two dissections of news stories causing 5G rollout confusion \\u2013 the UK\\u2019s 6/26/19 Glastonbury Festival and a notable 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland. Neither report clarifies which \\u201c5G\\u201d was involved.\\n\\u2022 Glastonbury protest article laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated hysteria that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Implied is that 2G-4G were not experiments. Paradox: They were and were not. Distinctions must be made.\\n\\u2022 Crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s.\\n\\u2022 Decision made long ago to put life/people at risk (see History of Official Awareness).Thus, thus the yes/no experiment is not IF harm, but when, and how the explosion will play out.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cGood\\u201d news: Human health collapse could be prevented \\u2013 by ecosystem collapse. Race is on.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s happening \\u2018on the ground.\\u2019 The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon.\\n\\u2022 Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. Verizon says this is MMW (5Gmmw). But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sacramento seems a most enthusiastic host. Website features Verizon UWB installation at citizen\\u2019s home, City officials attending. Sacramento also prides itself on attaining \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more below).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas \\u2013 could be its final destination.\\n\\u2022 Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason, with 3G/4G still operating. Again, the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\u2022 The forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. Drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for millions of closely spaced fixtures nationwide. There now seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\u2022 A report on new Qualcomm smartphone 5Gmmw antennas also covers antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\u2022 It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) is specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs say 4G can handle it. Probably 4Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 Some opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. The attempted deployment of smart utility meters on (4G) WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say.\\n\\u2022 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\u2022 I didn\\u2019t invest time trying to find where dense fixture locations are happening in neighborhoods. Rollout info suggests only populous areas. Readers who\\u2019ve seen this anywhere are asked to share in Comments.\\n\\u2022 If FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose.\\n\\u2022 Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams said in an interview that FLD is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d True, but not the whole truth. McAdam touted 5Gmmw for Smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality.\\n\\u2022 No matter the 5G version, wireless per se is the foundation for managing/controlling every aspect of daily life with \\u201cSmart\\u201d technology.\\n\\u2022 None of the above means things can\\u2019t change. MLB rollout could be precursor to an FLD/MMW invasion or satellite saturation in outlying areas. Speculation on MMW future and interface between ground and satellite purposes and services.\\n\\u2022 Parenthetical discussion of Sacramento-City web page showing total-surveillance/human-control system rapidly gestating under auspices of \\u201cSmart City for public safety/benefits\\u201d \\u2013 especially \\u201cProjects in Progress\\u201d. Note promise of \\u201cSTEM,\\u201d the nationwide programming for turning kids into corporate plug-ins.\\n\\u2022 STEM promises techno-shiny future, and exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. But the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum of the latter. Imagine the potential chaos once a Smart City become hackers target.\\n\\u2022 Mostly confusion in these reports, all implying 5Gmmw. No clear indication of which \\u201c5G\\u201d is involved in most cases \\u2013 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 People see new infrastructure and assume MMW.\\n\\u2022 All harms reported thus far are classic 2G-4G symptoms. Most are the \\u201cElectrohypersensitivity (EHS) type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\u2022 RF meters have been used to support claims of harm, but ordinary meters can\\u2019t read MMW. Such meters are professional, expensive, technical equipment.\\n\\u2022 A true 5G phone would ID MMW and MLB, but no meter shows frequencies, so even a pro one wouldn\\u2019t reveal which frequencies are present.\\n\\u2022 Long-term previous exposure plays into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Harm \\u201cverified\\u201d by ordinary meters proves 4G harm, one way or another.\\n\\u2022 One hawker claims its ordinary meter can read \\u201c5G,\\u201d a ruse brought to you by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 For most situations, meters not much use for most people \\u2013 no safe exposure level (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Meters sometimes useful for people using shielding, etc, but symptom improvement doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops..\\n\\u2022 Differences between MMW effects and long-reported classic 2G-4G effects can tentatively identify 5G frequency type.\\n\\u2022 MMW potentially threatens skin and eyes. A study irresponsibly (underhandedly?) cited in an article to prove \\u201c5G\\u201d has heart effects is exposed.\\n\\u2022 Study also implies that any microwave frequency at sufficient power can cook and kill you.\\n\\u2022 Possible, but still speculative, that 5Gmmw can cause MLB effects, because conductive body tissues can carry induced currents deep into the body.\\n\\u2022 MIMO (\\u2018my-mo\\u2019) antenna tech has been used for MLB for more than a decade. The new development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, or many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming beams of radiation.\\n\\u2022 One question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose a greater threat than traditional antennas. It\\u2019s possible. It seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of beams, although a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\u2022 Aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying beams avoids high power output per beam.\\n\\u2022 Hysteria often warns of an outrageously high increase in power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d For a few reasons, this seems unlikely.\\n\\u2022 Details of several typical news reports. Most demonstrate fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower will make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one, a general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\u2022 Story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from Verizon antenna installed near home illustrates confusion. Testimony before Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with mayor present.\\n\\u2022 Type of antenna not given, but probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\u2022 Strange that testimony date precedes stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests. Maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\u2022 Opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that mean? Incident suggests MMW effect, but still shows need to know what you mean when you say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although she commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but her suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness won\\u2019t be taken seriously.\\n\\u2022 Typically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\u2022 Even if new 5Gmlb antennas pose greater health risk, it\\u2019s academic, because the \\u2018pre-5G\\u2019 endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal.\\n\\u2022 Outrageous opposition-induced hysteria from Gateshead in UK about \\u201c5G\\u201d from street lights. Dangers of LED lights cited.\\n\\u2022 News report from Cincinnati shows folks in the dark about 5G, thanks to hysteria. Story from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, shows better awareness of wireless threat. Both show dangerous thinking about shutting down/moving tower (no one talking ecosystem).\\n\\u2022 An RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story, is cited as accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\u2022 Original 9/20/19 story (now includes update) a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria. No one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers previously. It\\u2019s a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that people fear will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d..\\n\\u2022 9/27/19 update shows interview with concerned nurse. \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacks understanding of wireless, will feel safer if that tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\u2022 Tall, new-look tower with cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video). Looks nothing like Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw antenna seen in phone report in the 5G Rollouts section.\\n\\u2022 Update also says it\\u2019s a Sprint tower, so can\\u2019t be MMW. \\u201c5G\\u201d fear an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s in cylindrical fixture and its specific functions are anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\u2022 Update also notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what?\\n\\u2022 3/12/19 San Joaquin report also concerns tall tower with cylindrical fixture \\u201ctoo close to school.\\u201d No 5G fear, more general awareness of wireless danger. \\u2018Cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\u2022 Three teachers and four students with various cancers since 2016 Also 22 year-old former male student. No mention of whether teachers and young man were exposed to any other towers/devices. Just that nasty tower\\u2026\\n\\u2022 Ripon case interesting for several reasons. Independent expert contradicted official assurance that tower tested OK. Shows common ignorance: \\u201c\\u2026kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sprint shut tower down, agreed to relocate. Good PR, suggests industry/towns will back down.\\n\\u2022 Two more reasons: First is overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure and probably cumulative effect (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Second reason, bogus advice \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the argument for slow death over quicker death, or futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can make things worse.\\n\\u2022 Any antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\u2022 Reducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usage tips and lower exposure limits. Both futile.\\n\\u2022 Reliance on power level to determine safety is largely a convenience, not science. Several other factors make determination too complex. They keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\u2022 Harm stories indicate people seem to think it just happened. Fatal error. Felt or not, effects can occur any time during or after exposure, so no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway.\\n\\u2022 An organization called EHS Idaho collects reports on incidence and effects in the Idaho population of electrohypersensitivity (EHS). Term misleading. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 suggested.\\n\\u2022 An estimated 35% of the Idaho population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. As bad as this is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad as things could quickly and easily get. Call this \\u201cpre-terminal disaster.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Illness caused by wireless radiation not new or unique to it, even though lists and categories of issues attributed to it.\\n\\u2022 Question: how much of today\\u2019s ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 all known prior to wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to wireless tech (or even the whole range of RF we \\u2019bathe\\u2019 in)?\\n\\u2022 If officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\u2022 For sick users \\u2014 much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\u2022 But quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\u2022 Manifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere.\\n\\u2022 If we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. I Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\u2022 One historical document acknowledging harm FCC denies is 1981 WHO report, Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973.\\n\\u2022 Very long report covers frequencies from 100 KHz to 300 GHz, but telecom/WiFi harm for last three decades has come from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\u2022 Quotes from document summary given, revealing ruthless deception. It\\u2019s all most people need to read. Section 1.1.6. admits safe level should be \\u201c\\u2026close to natural background levels\\u201d. Natural background microwave is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed).\\n\\nSo there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit after all: zero.\\n\\u2022 Safety \\u201cnot technically feasible.\\u201d Assumption that technology more important than environment and human health.\\n\\u2022 Notes and quotes from a presentation at 2009 Whole Health Expo reveal knowledge of harm since the 1950s. No indication in Summary if 1973 Warsaw Symposium or 1981 WHO reviewers were aware.\\n\\u2022 No indication in Summary that Symposium/WHO were aware of military microwave stealth-weapon research begun in 1950s. What eventually became 2G.\\n\\u2022 Worth repeating: The most dire threat is to ecosystem, not humans. No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\u2022 threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. One thing is certain about most technology, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\u2022 Threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about process of creating it..\\n\\u2022 From resource acquisition (especially mining) to disposal, technology is toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless covers the whole process.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cWired\\u201d systems will not stop this assault.\\n\\u2022 The attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed.\\n\\u2022 If one isn\\u2019t careful, one might conclude \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers think humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\u2022 Most hysteria focused on ground antennas, while well more than 50,000 new satellites are underway and proposed, a horrific threat.\\n\\u2022 Heavy pollution produced by each launch, as well as massive removal of atmospheric oxygen. dynamic graph linked.\\n\\u2022 Much still up in the air on satellites. Plan seems to be shoot them up first, answer proprietary questions later, dismissing anyone else\\u2019s.\\n\\u2022 In Europe there are calls for science papers on satellite/5G integration. There is an appeal to \\u2018stop 5G in space\\u2019, but popular emphasis remains disproportionately on ground installations.\\n\\u2022 Arrogant FCC has flatly dismissed legitimate concerns raised by NASA, NOAA and more. Does such arrogance suggest level of power beyond corporate/governmental?\\n\\u2022 Might such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates?\\n\\u2022 Best way to beat 5G on the ground is to reject all current wireless (3G/4G) at the commercial level. This could well impact satellites also.\\n\\u2022 Outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the ones on earthbound antennas.\\n\\u2022 Taking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\u2022 The race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse. Allowing classic 4G (or 5G FR1) to continue potentiates imminent disaster.\\n\\u2022 Experience shows that appeals, based on science, to governments at all levels; to national and international regulatory bodies, and so on is an exercise in futility.\\n\\u2022 It\\u2019s in the people\\u2019s hands. Give up wireless per se or give up the future \\u2013 liberty first, then life. If not, then welcome all 5G.

(majorly revised and updated). The full text is strongly encouraged; but two Summaries have been published for fast-trackers. This more detailed one, for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose, and a Text Summary for those who prefer a more general sweep. Both provide a means for seeing \\u201c5G\\u201d more clearly, and quickly accessing areas of particular interest.\\n\\nWhen you say, \\u201c5G\\u201d or \\u201dStop 5G,\\u201d please be sure you haven\\u2019t been misled about what it is, what you are opposing \\u2013 or want. Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts. This article attempts to raise some \\u2018dust\\u2019 and clear the air at the same time.\\n\\nBecause carrier rollouts and stories of harm are major opposition concerns, much detail is given to show how \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria makes things worse in various cases. Safety testing, history of official awareness of harm, and opposition priorities are also discussed.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Hysterical opposition to \\u201c5G\\u201d has created dangerous misconception, beginning with careless misuse of the very term \\u201c5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 When most people say \\u201c5G\\u201d they refer to its \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation, often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This is inaccurate, confusing and dangerous. EHF and 5G EHF are specified.\\n\\u2022 At least 4 Important distinctions must be kept in mind for understanding and discussing \\u201c5G,\\u201d especially one between the two 5G\\u2019s \\u2013 high frequency 5G and mid-band to low-band 5G.\\n\\u2022 Some terms are suggested to clear confusion and enhance discussion. \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d houses antennas. A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\u2022 Common, confusing warnings are discussed: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The term \\u201csmall cell\\u201d is misused, being applied to enclosures and/or fixtures instead of the area covered by antenna range. 5Gmmw has short range, thus its cell is small. \\u2018Making cases\\u2019.\\n\\u2022 MMW easily blocked, even by leaves and heavy rain, gets worse with increasing frequency requiring more fixture locations. Hysteria rarely notes that 5Gmlb is a large cell and is not blocked.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density. Common warnings about implementation are in serious question at this writing (more later).\\n\\u2022 Small cells are not new, not created for \\u201c5G\\u201d. There are traditionally three kinds.\\n\\u2022 From the outset: Opposition implies 5G is small cells/MMW. Typically careless statement given as example.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cThe skin\\u2019s sweat ducts act as receiving antennas for 5G\\u201d is speculative, based on a stretched interpretation of an Israeli study. Study details reviewed. Wording of its \\u201cwarning-flag\\u201d conclusion applies conceptually to all G\\u2019s. Harm was known decades before 2G (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\u2022 Insufficient correlation to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas. Making cases?\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G is a weapon\\u201d is based carelessly on the military\\u2019s ADS system that heats the skin. No correlation with commercial 5G mobile. MMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G.\\n\\u2022 2G began as a military weapon and was adapted to telecom. Entire wireless telecom system is a weapon.\\n\\u2022 All telecom/WiFi wireless frequencies, 2G-4G, will cook you at sufficiently high power levels. Telecom 5Gmmw at commercial levels will not.\\n\\u2022 A powerful Air Force radar system, Pave Paws, will cook you in a nanosecond at 450 MHz, so forget whine about \\u201c5G weapon.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 No ADS power range found, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study.\\n\\u2022 Power of microwave ovens and towers/phones compared. ADS configuration chosen to limit penetration depth.\\n\\u2022 No wattage output for 5G MLB or MMW antennas found, but did find Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of a 5Gmmw antenna for 28 and 38 GHz and compared with FCC standard.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G\\u201d per se opposition creates dangerous false sense of security encouraging continued use of pathological 3G/4G/WiFi wireless devices. Techno-humans adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G has not been safety tested\\u201d is a ploy. That the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d atrocities, whereas, the basic issue is wireless tech per se.\\n\\u2022 In 1996, FCC finally adopted ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992, covering frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range all MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019.\\n\\u2022 FCC assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is same fraud used to make assurances about 3G in 1996: \\u201cNo heat, no harm.\\u201d This author warned of this response to \\u201cStop 5G\\u201d in the 2/2019 article Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised?\\n\\u2022 Huge volume of science beginning in the 1950s brings up question whether *proper* testing was ever done.\\n\\u2022 FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science. This blatant criminality is clearly revealed by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 \\u201cCurrent FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d All official testing is fraud, can\\u2019t be \\u201coutdated.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 \\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing can exist.\\n\\u2022 More detail on the original testing cited two in sections of Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\u2022 Where infrastructure is concerned, emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA.\\u2019 But things seem to be developing differently. Even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\u2022 A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard covers two frequency ranges, FR1, FR2. One, for current bands below 6 GHz (3G/4G, i.e., 5Gmlb). Two, for 5Gmmw. WiFi remains separate for now\\n\\u2022 5G NR defines new protocols for MLB, providing at least 35% more 4G speed, while being called 5G without distinction. 5Gmlb can use same towers as 4G, has same range and penetration, but new antennas.\\n\\u2022 5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention, including \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and beamforming (more later).\\n\\u2022 Plans being made to market 5G in an unlicensed 3.5 GHz band of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service. MLB called 5G.\\n\\u2022 Apparently, current smartphones can be updated to process 5Gmlb; but 5Gmmw will require new (expensive) phones. Field tests: Samsung Galaxy S10 (good shot of 5Gmmw antenna/node in first article). Both advise \\u2018holding off\\u2019 on new, 5G phones.\\n\\u2022 Two possible motives behind \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria are addressed.\\n\\u2022 Two dissections of news stories causing 5G rollout confusion \\u2013 the UK\\u2019s 6/26/19 Glastonbury Festival and a notable 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland. Neither report clarifies which \\u201c5G\\u201d was involved.\\n\\u2022 Glastonbury protest article laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated hysteria that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Implied is that 2G-4G were not experiments. Paradox: They were and were not. Distinctions must be made.\\n\\u2022 Crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s.\\n\\u2022 Decision made long ago to put life/people at risk (see History of Official Awareness).Thus, thus the yes/no experiment is not IF harm, but when, and how the explosion will play out.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cGood\\u201d news: Human health collapse could be prevented \\u2013 by ecosystem collapse. Race is on.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s happening \\u2018on the ground.\\u2019 The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon.\\n\\u2022 Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. Verizon says this is MMW (5Gmmw). But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sacramento seems a most enthusiastic host. Website features Verizon UWB installation at citizen\\u2019s home, City officials attending. Sacramento also prides itself on attaining \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more below).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas \\u2013 could be its final destination.\\n\\u2022 Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason, with 3G/4G still operating. Again, the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\u2022 The forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. Drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for millions of closely spaced fixtures nationwide. There now seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\u2022 A report on new Qualcomm smartphone 5Gmmw antennas also covers antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\u2022 It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) is specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs say 4G can handle it. Probably 4Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 Some opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. The attempted deployment of smart utility meters on (4G) WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say.\\n\\u2022 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\u2022 I didn\\u2019t invest time trying to find where dense fixture locations are happening in neighborhoods. Rollout info suggests only populous areas. Readers who\\u2019ve seen this anywhere are asked to share in Comments.\\n\\u2022 If FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose.\\n\\u2022 Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams said in an interview that FLD is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d True, but not the whole truth. McAdam touted 5Gmmw for Smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality.\\n\\u2022 No matter the 5G version, wireless per se is the foundation for managing/controlling every aspect of daily life with \\u201cSmart\\u201d technology.\\n\\u2022 None of the above means things can\\u2019t change. MLB rollout could be precursor to an FLD/MMW invasion or satellite saturation in outlying areas. Speculation on MMW future and interface between ground and satellite purposes and services.\\n\\u2022 Parenthetical discussion of Sacramento-City web page showing total-surveillance/human-control system rapidly gestating under auspices of \\u201cSmart City for public safety/benefits\\u201d \\u2013 especially \\u201cProjects in Progress\\u201d. Note promise of \\u201cSTEM,\\u201d the nationwide programming for turning kids into corporate plug-ins.\\n\\u2022 STEM promises techno-shiny future, and exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. But the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum of the latter. Imagine the potential chaos once a Smart City become hackers target.\\n\\u2022 Mostly confusion in these reports, all implying 5Gmmw. No clear indication of which \\u201c5G\\u201d is involved in most cases \\u2013 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 People see new infrastructure and assume MMW.\\n\\u2022 All harms reported thus far are classic 2G-4G symptoms. Most are the \\u201cElectrohypersensitivity (EHS) type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\u2022 RF meters have been used to support claims of harm, but ordinary meters can\\u2019t read MMW. Such meters are professional, expensive, technical equipment.\\n\\u2022 A true 5G phone would ID MMW and MLB, but no meter shows frequencies, so even a pro one wouldn\\u2019t reveal which frequencies are present.\\n\\u2022 Long-term previous exposure plays into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Harm \\u201cverified\\u201d by ordinary meters proves 4G harm, one way or another.\\n\\u2022 One hawker claims its ordinary meter can read \\u201c5G,\\u201d a ruse brought to you by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 For most situations, meters not much use for most people \\u2013 no safe exposure level (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Meters sometimes useful for people using shielding, etc, but symptom improvement doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops..\\n\\u2022 Differences between MMW effects and long-reported classic 2G-4G effects can tentatively identify 5G frequency type.\\n\\u2022 MMW potentially threatens skin and eyes. A study irresponsibly (underhandedly?) cited in an article to prove \\u201c5G\\u201d has heart effects is exposed.\\n\\u2022 Study also implies that any microwave frequency at sufficient power can cook and kill you.\\n\\u2022 Possible, but still speculative, that 5Gmmw can cause MLB effects, because conductive body tissues can carry induced currents deep into the body.\\n\\u2022 MIMO (\\u2018my-mo\\u2019) antenna tech has been used for MLB for more than a decade. The new development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, or many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming beams of radiation.\\n\\u2022 One question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose a greater threat than traditional antennas. It\\u2019s possible. It seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of beams, although a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\u2022 Aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying beams avoids high power output per beam.\\n\\u2022 Hysteria often warns of an outrageously high increase in power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d For a few reasons, this seems unlikely.\\n\\u2022 Details of several typical news reports. Most demonstrate fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower will make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one, a general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\u2022 Story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from Verizon antenna installed near home illustrates confusion. Testimony before Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with mayor present.\\n\\u2022 Type of antenna not given, but probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\u2022 Strange that testimony date precedes stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests. Maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\u2022 Opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that mean? Incident suggests MMW effect, but still shows need to know what you mean when you say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although she commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but her suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness won\\u2019t be taken seriously.\\n\\u2022 Typically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\u2022 Even if new 5Gmlb antennas pose greater health risk, it\\u2019s academic, because the \\u2018pre-5G\\u2019 endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal.\\n\\u2022 Outrageous opposition-induced hysteria from Gateshead in UK about \\u201c5G\\u201d from street lights. Dangers of LED lights cited.\\n\\u2022 News report from Cincinnati shows folks in the dark about 5G, thanks to hysteria. Story from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, shows better awareness of wireless threat. Both show dangerous thinking about shutting down/moving tower (no one talking ecosystem).\\n\\u2022 An RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story, is cited as accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\u2022 Original 9/20/19 story (now includes update) a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria. No one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers previously. It\\u2019s a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that people fear will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d..\\n\\u2022 9/27/19 update shows interview with concerned nurse. \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacks understanding of wireless, will feel safer if that tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\u2022 Tall, new-look tower with cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video). Looks nothing like Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw antenna seen in phone report in the 5G Rollouts section.\\n\\u2022 Update also says it\\u2019s a Sprint tower, so can\\u2019t be MMW. \\u201c5G\\u201d fear an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s in cylindrical fixture and its specific functions are anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\u2022 Update also notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what?\\n\\u2022 3/12/19 San Joaquin report also concerns tall tower with cylindrical fixture \\u201ctoo close to school.\\u201d No 5G fear, more general awareness of wireless danger. \\u2018Cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\u2022 Three teachers and four students with various cancers since 2016 Also 22 year-old former male student. No mention of whether teachers and young man were exposed to any other towers/devices. Just that nasty tower\\u2026\\n\\u2022 Ripon case interesting for several reasons. Independent expert contradicted official assurance that tower tested OK. Shows common ignorance: \\u201c\\u2026kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sprint shut tower down, agreed to relocate. Good PR, suggests industry/towns will back down.\\n\\u2022 Two more reasons: First is overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure and probably cumulative effect (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Second reason, bogus advice \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the argument for slow death over quicker death, or futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can make things worse.\\n\\u2022 Any antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\u2022 Reducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usage tips and lower exposure limits. Both futile.\\n\\u2022 Reliance on power level to determine safety is largely a convenience, not science. Several other factors make determination too complex. They keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\u2022 Harm stories indicate people seem to think it just happened. Fatal error. Felt or not, effects can occur any time during or after exposure, so no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway.\\n\\u2022 An organization called EHS Idaho collects reports on incidence and effects in the Idaho population of electrohypersensitivity (EHS). Term misleading. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 suggested.\\n\\u2022 An estimated 35% of the Idaho population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. As bad as this is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad as things could quickly and easily get. Call this \\u201cpre-terminal disaster.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Illness caused by wireless radiation not new or unique to it, even though lists and categories of issues attributed to it.\\n\\u2022 Question: how much of today\\u2019s ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 all known prior to wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to wireless tech (or even the whole range of RF we \\u2019bathe\\u2019 in)?\\n\\u2022 If officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\u2022 For sick users \\u2014 much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\u2022 But quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\u2022 Manifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere.\\n\\u2022 If we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. I Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\u2022 One historical document acknowledging harm FCC denies is 1981 WHO report, Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves.

There is an appeal to \\u2018stop 5G in space\\u2019, but popular emphasis remains disproportionately on ground installations.\\n\\u2022 Arrogant FCC has flatly dismissed legitimate concerns raised by NASA, NOAA and more. Does such arrogance suggest level of power beyond corporate/governmental?\\n\\u2022 Might such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates?\\n\\u2022 Best way to beat 5G on the ground is to reject all current wireless (3G/4G) at the commercial level. This could well impact satellites also.\\n\\u2022 Outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the ones on earthbound antennas.\\n\\u2022 Taking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\u2022 The race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse.

(majorly revised and updated). The full text is strongly encouraged; but two Summaries have been published for fast-trackers. This more detailed one, for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose, and a Text Summary for those who prefer a more general sweep. Both provide a means for seeing \\u201c5G\\u201d more clearly, and quickly accessing areas of particular interest.\\n\\nWhen you say, \\u201c5G\\u201d or \\u201dStop 5G,\\u201d please be sure you haven\\u2019t been misled about what it is, what you are opposing \\u2013 or want. Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts. This article attempts to raise some \\u2018dust\\u2019 and clear the air at the same time.\\n\\nBecause carrier rollouts and stories of harm are major opposition concerns, much detail is given to show how \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria makes things worse in various cases. Safety testing, history of official awareness of harm, and opposition priorities are also discussed.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Hysterical opposition to \\u201c5G\\u201d has created dangerous misconception, beginning with careless misuse of the very term \\u201c5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 When most people say \\u201c5G\\u201d they refer to its \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation, often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This is inaccurate, confusing and dangerous. EHF and 5G EHF are specified.\\n\\u2022 At least 4 Important distinctions must be kept in mind for understanding and discussing \\u201c5G,\\u201d especially one between the two 5G\\u2019s \\u2013 high frequency 5G and mid-band to low-band 5G.\\n\\u2022 Some terms are suggested to clear confusion and enhance discussion. \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d houses antennas. A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\u2022 Common, confusing warnings are discussed: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The term \\u201csmall cell\\u201d is misused, being applied to enclosures and/or fixtures instead of the area covered by antenna range. 5Gmmw has short range, thus its cell is small. \\u2018Making cases\\u2019.\\n\\u2022 MMW easily blocked, even by leaves and heavy rain, gets worse with increasing frequency requiring more fixture locations. Hysteria rarely notes that 5Gmlb is a large cell and is not blocked.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density. Common warnings about implementation are in serious question at this writing (more later).\\n\\u2022 Small cells are not new, not created for \\u201c5G\\u201d. There are traditionally three kinds.\\n\\u2022 From the outset: Opposition implies 5G is small cells/MMW. Typically careless statement given as example.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cThe skin\\u2019s sweat ducts act as receiving antennas for 5G\\u201d is speculative, based on a stretched interpretation of an Israeli study. Study details reviewed. Wording of its \\u201cwarning-flag\\u201d conclusion applies conceptually to all G\\u2019s. Harm was known decades before 2G (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\u2022 Insufficient correlation to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas. Making cases?\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G is a weapon\\u201d is based carelessly on the military\\u2019s ADS system that heats the skin. No correlation with commercial 5G mobile. MMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G.\\n\\u2022 2G began as a military weapon and was adapted to telecom. Entire wireless telecom system is a weapon.\\n\\u2022 All telecom/WiFi wireless frequencies, 2G-4G, will cook you at sufficiently high power levels. Telecom 5Gmmw at commercial levels will not.\\n\\u2022 A powerful Air Force radar system, Pave Paws, will cook you in a nanosecond at 450 MHz, so forget whine about \\u201c5G weapon.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 No ADS power range found, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study.\\n\\u2022 Power of microwave ovens and towers/phones compared. ADS configuration chosen to limit penetration depth.\\n\\u2022 No wattage output for 5G MLB or MMW antennas found, but did find Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of a 5Gmmw antenna for 28 and 38 GHz and compared with FCC standard.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G\\u201d per se opposition creates dangerous false sense of security encouraging continued use of pathological 3G/4G/WiFi wireless devices. Techno-humans adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G has not been safety tested\\u201d is a ploy. That the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d atrocities, whereas, the basic issue is wireless tech per se.\\n\\u2022 In 1996, FCC finally adopted ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992, covering frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range all MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019.\\n\\u2022 FCC assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is same fraud used to make assurances about 3G in 1996: \\u201cNo heat, no harm.\\u201d This author warned of this response to \\u201cStop 5G\\u201d in the 2/2019 article Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised?\\n\\u2022 Huge volume of science beginning in the 1950s brings up question whether *proper* testing was ever done.\\n\\u2022 FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science. This blatant criminality is clearly revealed by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 \\u201cCurrent FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d All official testing is fraud, can\\u2019t be \\u201coutdated.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 \\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing can exist.\\n\\u2022 More detail on the original testing cited two in sections of Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\u2022 Where infrastructure is concerned, emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA.\\u2019 But things seem to be developing differently. Even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\u2022 A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard covers two frequency ranges, FR1, FR2. One, for current bands below 6 GHz (3G/4G, i.e., 5Gmlb). Two, for 5Gmmw. WiFi remains separate for now\\n\\u2022 5G NR defines new protocols for MLB, providing at least 35% more 4G speed, while being called 5G without distinction. 5Gmlb can use same towers as 4G, has same range and penetration, but new antennas.\\n\\u2022 5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention, including \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and beamforming (more later).\\n\\u2022 Plans being made to market 5G in an unlicensed 3.5 GHz band of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service. MLB called 5G.\\n\\u2022 Apparently, current smartphones can be updated to process 5Gmlb; but 5Gmmw will require new (expensive) phones. Field tests: Samsung Galaxy S10 (good shot of 5Gmmw antenna/node in first article). Both advise \\u2018holding off\\u2019 on new, 5G phones.\\n\\u2022 Two possible motives behind \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria are addressed.\\n\\u2022 Two dissections of news stories causing 5G rollout confusion \\u2013 the UK\\u2019s 6/26/19 Glastonbury Festival and a notable 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland. Neither report clarifies which \\u201c5G\\u201d was involved.\\n\\u2022 Glastonbury protest article laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated hysteria that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Implied is that 2G-4G were not experiments. Paradox: They were and were not. Distinctions must be made.\\n\\u2022 Crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s.\\n\\u2022 Decision made long ago to put life/people at risk (see History of Official Awareness).Thus, thus the yes/no experiment is not IF harm, but when, and how the explosion will play out.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cGood\\u201d news: Human health collapse could be prevented \\u2013 by ecosystem collapse. Race is on.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s happening \\u2018on the ground.\\u2019 The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon.\\n\\u2022 Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. Verizon says this is MMW (5Gmmw). But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sacramento seems a most enthusiastic host. Website features Verizon UWB installation at citizen\\u2019s home, City officials attending. Sacramento also prides itself on attaining \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more below).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas \\u2013 could be its final destination.\\n\\u2022 Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason, with 3G/4G still operating. Again, the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\u2022 The forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. Drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for millions of closely spaced fixtures nationwide. There now seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\u2022 A report on new Qualcomm smartphone 5Gmmw antennas also covers antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\u2022 It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) is specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs say 4G can handle it. Probably 4Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 Some opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. The attempted deployment of smart utility meters on (4G) WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say.\\n\\u2022 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\u2022 I didn\\u2019t invest time trying to find where dense fixture locations are happening in neighborhoods. Rollout info suggests only populous areas. Readers who\\u2019ve seen this anywhere are asked to share in Comments.\\n\\u2022 If FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose.\\n\\u2022 Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams said in an interview that FLD is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d True, but not the whole truth. McAdam touted 5Gmmw for Smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality.\\n\\u2022 No matter the 5G version, wireless per se is the foundation for managing/controlling every aspect of daily life with \\u201cSmart\\u201d technology.\\n\\u2022 None of the above means things can\\u2019t change. MLB rollout could be precursor to an FLD/MMW invasion or satellite saturation in outlying areas. Speculation on MMW future and interface between ground and satellite purposes and services.\\n\\u2022 Parenthetical discussion of Sacramento-City web page showing total-surveillance/human-control system rapidly gestating under auspices of \\u201cSmart City for public safety/benefits\\u201d \\u2013 especially \\u201cProjects in Progress\\u201d. Note promise of \\u201cSTEM,\\u201d the nationwide programming for turning kids into corporate plug-ins.\\n\\u2022 STEM promises techno-shiny future, and exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. But the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum of the latter. Imagine the potential chaos once a Smart City become hackers target.\\n\\u2022 Mostly confusion in these reports, all implying 5Gmmw. No clear indication of which \\u201c5G\\u201d is involved in most cases \\u2013 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 People see new infrastructure and assume MMW.\\n\\u2022 All harms reported thus far are classic 2G-4G symptoms. Most are the \\u201cElectrohypersensitivity (EHS) type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\u2022 RF meters have been used to support claims of harm, but ordinary meters can\\u2019t read MMW. Such meters are professional, expensive, technical equipment.\\n\\u2022 A true 5G phone would ID MMW and MLB, but no meter shows frequencies, so even a pro one wouldn\\u2019t reveal which frequencies are present.\\n\\u2022 Long-term previous exposure plays into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Harm \\u201cverified\\u201d by ordinary meters proves 4G harm, one way or another.\\n\\u2022 One hawker claims its ordinary meter can read \\u201c5G,\\u201d a ruse brought to you by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 For most situations, meters not much use for most people \\u2013 no safe exposure level (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Meters sometimes useful for people using shielding, etc, but symptom improvement doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops..\\n\\u2022 Differences between MMW effects and long-reported classic 2G-4G effects can tentatively identify 5G frequency type.\\n\\u2022 MMW potentially threatens skin and eyes. A study irresponsibly (underhandedly?) cited in an article to prove \\u201c5G\\u201d has heart effects is exposed.\\n\\u2022 Study also implies that any microwave frequency at sufficient power can cook and kill you.\\n\\u2022 Possible, but still speculative, that 5Gmmw can cause MLB effects, because conductive body tissues can carry induced currents deep into the body.\\n\\u2022 MIMO (\\u2018my-mo\\u2019) antenna tech has been used for MLB for more than a decade. The new development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, or many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming beams of radiation.\\n\\u2022 One question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose a greater threat than traditional antennas. It\\u2019s possible. It seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of beams, although a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\u2022 Aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying beams avoids high power output per beam.\\n\\u2022 Hysteria often warns of an outrageously high increase in power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d For a few reasons, this seems unlikely.\\n\\u2022 Details of several typical news reports. Most demonstrate fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower will make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one, a general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\u2022 Story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from Verizon antenna installed near home illustrates confusion. Testimony before Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with mayor present.\\n\\u2022 Type of antenna not given, but probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\u2022 Strange that testimony date precedes stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests. Maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\u2022 Opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that mean? Incident suggests MMW effect, but still shows need to know what you mean when you say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although she commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but her suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness won\\u2019t be taken seriously.\\n\\u2022 Typically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\u2022 Even if new 5Gmlb antennas pose greater health risk, it\\u2019s academic, because the \\u2018pre-5G\\u2019 endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal.\\n\\u2022 Outrageous opposition-induced hysteria from Gateshead in UK about \\u201c5G\\u201d from street lights. Dangers of LED lights cited.\\n\\u2022 News report from Cincinnati shows folks in the dark about 5G, thanks to hysteria. Story from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, shows better awareness of wireless threat. Both show dangerous thinking about shutting down/moving tower (no one talking ecosystem).\\n\\u2022 An RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story, is cited as accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\u2022 Original 9/20/19 story (now includes update) a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria. No one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers previously. It\\u2019s a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that people fear will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d..\\n\\u2022 9/27/19 update shows interview with concerned nurse. \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacks understanding of wireless, will feel safer if that tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\u2022 Tall, new-look tower with cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video). Looks nothing like Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw antenna seen in phone report in the 5G Rollouts section.\\n\\u2022 Update also says it\\u2019s a Sprint tower, so can\\u2019t be MMW. \\u201c5G\\u201d fear an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s in cylindrical fixture and its specific functions are anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\u2022 Update also notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what?\\n\\u2022 3/12/19 San Joaquin report also concerns tall tower with cylindrical fixture \\u201ctoo close to school.\\u201d No 5G fear, more general awareness of wireless danger. \\u2018Cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\u2022 Three teachers and four students with various cancers since 2016 Also 22 year-old former male student. No mention of whether teachers and young man were exposed to any other towers/devices. Just that nasty tower\\u2026\\n\\u2022 Ripon case interesting for several reasons. Independent expert contradicted official assurance that tower tested OK. Shows common ignorance: \\u201c\\u2026kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sprint shut tower down, agreed to relocate. Good PR, suggests industry/towns will back down.\\n\\u2022 Two more reasons: First is overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure and probably cumulative effect (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Second reason, bogus advice \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the argument for slow death over quicker death, or futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can make things worse.\\n\\u2022 Any antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\u2022 Reducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usage tips and lower exposure limits. Both futile.\\n\\u2022 Reliance on power level to determine safety is largely a convenience, not science. Several other factors make determination too complex. They keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\u2022 Harm stories indicate people seem to think it just happened. Fatal error. Felt or not, effects can occur any time during or after exposure, so no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway.\\n\\u2022 An organization called EHS Idaho collects reports on incidence and effects in the Idaho population of electrohypersensitivity (EHS). Term misleading. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 suggested.\\n\\u2022 An estimated 35% of the Idaho population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. As bad as this is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad as things could quickly and easily get. Call this \\u201cpre-terminal disaster.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Illness caused by wireless radiation not new or unique to it, even though lists and categories of issues attributed to it.\\n\\u2022 Question: how much of today\\u2019s ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 all known prior to wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to wireless tech (or even the whole range of RF we \\u2019bathe\\u2019 in)?\\n\\u2022 If officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\u2022 For sick users \\u2014 much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\u2022 But quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\u2022 Manifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere.\\n\\u2022 If we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. I Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\u2022 One historical document acknowledging harm FCC denies is 1981 WHO report, Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973.\\n\\u2022 Very long report covers frequencies from 100 KHz to 300 GHz, but telecom/WiFi harm for last three decades has come from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\u2022 Quotes from document summary given, revealing ruthless deception. It\\u2019s all most people need to read. Section 1.1.6. admits safe level should be \\u201c\\u2026close to natural background levels\\u201d. Natural background microwave is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed).\\n\\nSo there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit after all: zero.\\n\\u2022 Safety \\u201cnot technically feasible.\\u201d Assumption that technology more important than environment and human health.\\n\\u2022 Notes and quotes from a presentation at 2009 Whole Health Expo reveal knowledge of harm since the 1950s. No indication in Summary if 1973 Warsaw Symposium or 1981 WHO reviewers were aware.\\n\\u2022 No indication in Summary that Symposium/WHO were aware of military microwave stealth-weapon research begun in 1950s. What eventually became 2G.\\n\\u2022 Worth repeating: The most dire threat is to ecosystem, not humans. No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\u2022 threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. One thing is certain about most technology, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\u2022 Threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about process of creating it..\\n\\u2022 From resource acquisition (especially mining) to disposal, technology is toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless covers the whole process.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cWired\\u201d systems will not stop this assault.\\n\\u2022 The attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed.\\n\\u2022 If one isn\\u2019t careful, one might conclude \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers think humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\u2022 Most hysteria focused on ground antennas, while well more than 50,000 new satellites are underway and proposed, a horrific threat.\\n\\u2022 Heavy pollution produced by each launch, as well as massive removal of atmospheric oxygen. dynamic graph linked.\\n\\u2022 Much still up in the air on satellites. Plan seems to be shoot them up first, answer proprietary questions later, dismissing anyone else\\u2019s.\\n\\u2022 In Europe there are calls for science papers on satellite/5G integration. There is an appeal to \\u2018stop 5G in space\\u2019, but popular emphasis remains disproportionately on ground installations.\\n\\u2022 Arrogant FCC has flatly dismissed legitimate concerns raised by NASA, NOAA and more. Does such arrogance suggest level of power beyond corporate/governmental?\\n\\u2022 Might such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates?\\n\\u2022 Best way to beat 5G on the ground is to reject all current wireless (3G/4G) at the commercial level. This could well impact satellites also.\\n\\u2022 Outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the ones on earthbound antennas.\\n\\u2022 Taking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\u2022 The race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse. Allowing classic 4G (or 5G FR1) to continue potentiates imminent disaster.\\n\\u2022 Experience shows that appeals, based on science, to governments at all levels; to national and international regulatory bodies, and so on is an exercise in futility.\\n\\u2022 It\\u2019s in the people\\u2019s hands.

(majorly revised and updated). The full text is strongly encouraged; but two Summaries have been published for fast-trackers. This more detailed one, for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose, and a Text Summary for those who prefer a more general sweep. Both provide a means for seeing \\u201c5G\\u201d more clearly, and quickly accessing areas of particular interest.\\n\\nWhen you say, \\u201c5G\\u201d or \\u201dStop 5G,\\u201d please be sure you haven\\u2019t been misled about what it is, what you are opposing \\u2013 or want. Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts. This article attempts to raise some \\u2018dust\\u2019 and clear the air at the same time.\\n\\nBecause carrier rollouts and stories of harm are major opposition concerns, much detail is given to show how \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria makes things worse in various cases. Safety testing, history of official awareness of harm, and opposition priorities are also discussed.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Hysterical opposition to \\u201c5G\\u201d has created dangerous misconception, beginning with careless misuse of the very term \\u201c5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 When most people say \\u201c5G\\u201d they refer to its \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation, often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This is inaccurate, confusing and dangerous. EHF and 5G EHF are specified.\\n\\u2022 At least 4 Important distinctions must be kept in mind for understanding and discussing \\u201c5G,\\u201d especially one between the two 5G\\u2019s \\u2013 high frequency 5G and mid-band to low-band 5G.\\n\\u2022 Some terms are suggested to clear confusion and enhance discussion. \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d houses antennas. A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\u2022 Common, confusing warnings are discussed: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The term \\u201csmall cell\\u201d is misused, being applied to enclosures and/or fixtures instead of the area covered by antenna range. 5Gmmw has short range, thus its cell is small. \\u2018Making cases\\u2019.\\n\\u2022 MMW easily blocked, even by leaves and heavy rain, gets worse with increasing frequency requiring more fixture locations. Hysteria rarely notes that 5Gmlb is a large cell and is not blocked.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density. Common warnings about implementation are in serious question at this writing (more later).\\n\\u2022 Small cells are not new, not created for \\u201c5G\\u201d. There are traditionally three kinds.\\n\\u2022 From the outset: Opposition implies 5G is small cells/MMW. Typically careless statement given as example.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cThe skin\\u2019s sweat ducts act as receiving antennas for 5G\\u201d is speculative, based on a stretched interpretation of an Israeli study. Study details reviewed. Wording of its \\u201cwarning-flag\\u201d conclusion applies conceptually to all G\\u2019s. Harm was known decades before 2G (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\u2022 Insufficient correlation to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas. Making cases?\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G is a weapon\\u201d is based carelessly on the military\\u2019s ADS system that heats the skin. No correlation with commercial 5G mobile. MMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G.\\n\\u2022 2G began as a military weapon and was adapted to telecom. Entire wireless telecom system is a weapon.\\n\\u2022 All telecom/WiFi wireless frequencies, 2G-4G, will cook you at sufficiently high power levels. Telecom 5Gmmw at commercial levels will not.\\n\\u2022 A powerful Air Force radar system, Pave Paws, will cook you in a nanosecond at 450 MHz, so forget whine about \\u201c5G weapon.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 No ADS power range found, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study.\\n\\u2022 Power of microwave ovens and towers/phones compared. ADS configuration chosen to limit penetration depth.\\n\\u2022 No wattage output for 5G MLB or MMW antennas found, but did find Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of a 5Gmmw antenna for 28 and 38 GHz and compared with FCC standard.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G\\u201d per se opposition creates dangerous false sense of security encouraging continued use of pathological 3G/4G/WiFi wireless devices. Techno-humans adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G has not been safety tested\\u201d is a ploy. That the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d atrocities, whereas, the basic issue is wireless tech per se.\\n\\u2022 In 1996, FCC finally adopted ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992, covering frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range all MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019.\\n\\u2022 FCC assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is same fraud used to make assurances about 3G in 1996: \\u201cNo heat, no harm.\\u201d This author warned of this response to \\u201cStop 5G\\u201d in the 2/2019 article Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised?\\n\\u2022 Huge volume of science beginning in the 1950s brings up question whether *proper* testing was ever done.\\n\\u2022 FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science. This blatant criminality is clearly revealed by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 \\u201cCurrent FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d All official testing is fraud, can\\u2019t be \\u201coutdated.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 \\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing can exist.\\n\\u2022 More detail on the original testing cited two in sections of Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\u2022 Where infrastructure is concerned, emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA.\\u2019 But things seem to be developing differently. Even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\u2022 A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard covers two frequency ranges, FR1, FR2. One, for current bands below 6 GHz (3G/4G, i.e., 5Gmlb). Two, for 5Gmmw. WiFi remains separate for now\\n\\u2022 5G NR defines new protocols for MLB, providing at least 35% more 4G speed, while being called 5G without distinction. 5Gmlb can use same towers as 4G, has same range and penetration, but new antennas.\\n\\u2022 5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention, including \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and beamforming (more later).\\n\\u2022 Plans being made to market 5G in an unlicensed 3.5 GHz band of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service. MLB called 5G.\\n\\u2022 Apparently, current smartphones can be updated to process 5Gmlb; but 5Gmmw will require new (expensive) phones. Field tests: Samsung Galaxy S10 (good shot of 5Gmmw antenna/node in first article). Both advise \\u2018holding off\\u2019 on new, 5G phones.\\n\\u2022 Two possible motives behind \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria are addressed.\\n\\u2022 Two dissections of news stories causing 5G rollout confusion \\u2013 the UK\\u2019s 6/26/19 Glastonbury Festival and a notable 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland. Neither report clarifies which \\u201c5G\\u201d was involved.\\n\\u2022 Glastonbury protest article laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated hysteria that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Implied is that 2G-4G were not experiments. Paradox: They were and were not. Distinctions must be made.\\n\\u2022 Crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s.\\n\\u2022 Decision made long ago to put life/people at risk (see History of Official Awareness).Thus, thus the yes/no experiment is not IF harm, but when, and how the explosion will play out.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cGood\\u201d news: Human health collapse could be prevented \\u2013 by ecosystem collapse. Race is on.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s happening \\u2018on the ground.\\u2019 The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon.\\n\\u2022 Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. Verizon says this is MMW (5Gmmw). But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sacramento seems a most enthusiastic host. Website features Verizon UWB installation at citizen\\u2019s home, City officials attending. Sacramento also prides itself on attaining \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more below).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas \\u2013 could be its final destination.\\n\\u2022 Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason, with 3G/4G still operating. Again, the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\u2022 The forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. Drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for millions of closely spaced fixtures nationwide. There now seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\u2022 A report on new Qualcomm smartphone 5Gmmw antennas also covers antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\u2022 It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) is specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs say 4G can handle it. Probably 4Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 Some opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. The attempted deployment of smart utility meters on (4G) WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say.\\n\\u2022 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\u2022 I didn\\u2019t invest time trying to find where dense fixture locations are happening in neighborhoods. Rollout info suggests only populous areas. Readers who\\u2019ve seen this anywhere are asked to share in Comments.\\n\\u2022 If FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose.\\n\\u2022 Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams said in an interview that FLD is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d True, but not the whole truth. McAdam touted 5Gmmw for Smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality.\\n\\u2022 No matter the 5G version, wireless per se is the foundation for managing/controlling every aspect of daily life with \\u201cSmart\\u201d technology.\\n\\u2022 None of the above means things can\\u2019t change. MLB rollout could be precursor to an FLD/MMW invasion or satellite saturation in outlying areas. Speculation on MMW future and interface between ground and satellite purposes and services.\\n\\u2022 Parenthetical discussion of Sacramento-City web page showing total-surveillance/human-control system rapidly gestating under auspices of \\u201cSmart City for public safety/benefits\\u201d \\u2013 especially \\u201cProjects in Progress\\u201d. Note promise of \\u201cSTEM,\\u201d the nationwide programming for turning kids into corporate plug-ins.\\n\\u2022 STEM promises techno-shiny future, and exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. But the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum of the latter. Imagine the potential chaos once a Smart City become hackers target.\\n\\u2022 Mostly confusion in these reports, all implying 5Gmmw. No clear indication of which \\u201c5G\\u201d is involved in most cases \\u2013 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 People see new infrastructure and assume MMW.\\n\\u2022 All harms reported thus far are classic 2G-4G symptoms. Most are the \\u201cElectrohypersensitivity (EHS) type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\u2022 RF meters have been used to support claims of harm, but ordinary meters can\\u2019t read MMW. Such meters are professional, expensive, technical equipment.\\n\\u2022 A true 5G phone would ID MMW and MLB, but no meter shows frequencies, so even a pro one wouldn\\u2019t reveal which frequencies are present.\\n\\u2022 Long-term previous exposure plays into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Harm \\u201cverified\\u201d by ordinary meters proves 4G harm, one way or another.\\n\\u2022 One hawker claims its ordinary meter can read \\u201c5G,\\u201d a ruse brought to you by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 For most situations, meters not much use for most people \\u2013 no safe exposure level (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Meters sometimes useful for people using shielding, etc, but symptom improvement doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops..\\n\\u2022 Differences between MMW effects and long-reported classic 2G-4G effects can tentatively identify 5G frequency type.\\n\\u2022 MMW potentially threatens skin and eyes. A study irresponsibly (underhandedly?) cited in an article to prove \\u201c5G\\u201d has heart effects is exposed.\\n\\u2022 Study also implies that any microwave frequency at sufficient power can cook and kill you.\\n\\u2022 Possible, but still speculative, that 5Gmmw can cause MLB effects, because conductive body tissues can carry induced currents deep into the body.\\n\\u2022 MIMO (\\u2018my-mo\\u2019) antenna tech has been used for MLB for more than a decade. The new development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, or many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming beams of radiation.\\n\\u2022 One question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose a greater threat than traditional antennas. It\\u2019s possible. It seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of beams, although a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\u2022 Aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying beams avoids high power output per beam.\\n\\u2022 Hysteria often warns of an outrageously high increase in power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d For a few reasons, this seems unlikely.\\n\\u2022 Details of several typical news reports. Most demonstrate fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower will make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one, a general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\u2022 Story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from Verizon antenna installed near home illustrates confusion. Testimony before Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with mayor present.\\n\\u2022 Type of antenna not given, but probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\u2022 Strange that testimony date precedes stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests. Maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\u2022 Opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that mean? Incident suggests MMW effect, but still shows need to know what you mean when you say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although she commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but her suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness won\\u2019t be taken seriously.\\n\\u2022 Typically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\u2022 Even if new 5Gmlb antennas pose greater health risk, it\\u2019s academic, because the \\u2018pre-5G\\u2019 endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal.\\n\\u2022 Outrageous opposition-induced hysteria from Gateshead in UK about \\u201c5G\\u201d from street lights. Dangers of LED lights cited.\\n\\u2022 News report from Cincinnati shows folks in the dark about 5G, thanks to hysteria. Story from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, shows better awareness of wireless threat. Both show dangerous thinking about shutting down/moving tower (no one talking ecosystem).\\n\\u2022 An RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story, is cited as accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\u2022 Original 9/20/19 story (now includes update) a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria. No one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers previously. It\\u2019s a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that people fear will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d..\\n\\u2022 9/27/19 update shows interview with concerned nurse. \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacks understanding of wireless, will feel safer if that tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\u2022 Tall, new-look tower with cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video). Looks nothing like Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw antenna seen in phone report in the 5G Rollouts section.\\n\\u2022 Update also says it\\u2019s a Sprint tower, so can\\u2019t be MMW. \\u201c5G\\u201d fear an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s in cylindrical fixture and its specific functions are anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\u2022 Update also notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what?\\n\\u2022 3/12/19 San Joaquin report also concerns tall tower with cylindrical fixture \\u201ctoo close to school.\\u201d No 5G fear, more general awareness of wireless danger. \\u2018Cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\u2022 Three teachers and four students with various cancers since 2016 Also 22 year-old former male student. No mention of whether teachers and young man were exposed to any other towers/devices. Just that nasty tower\\u2026\\n\\u2022 Ripon case interesting for several reasons. Independent expert contradicted official assurance that tower tested OK. Shows common ignorance: \\u201c\\u2026kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sprint shut tower down, agreed to relocate. Good PR, suggests industry/towns will back down.\\n\\u2022 Two more reasons: First is overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure and probably cumulative effect (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Second reason, bogus advice \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the argument for slow death over quicker death, or futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can make things worse.\\n\\u2022 Any antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\u2022 Reducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usage tips and lower exposure limits. Both futile.\\n\\u2022 Reliance on power level to determine safety is largely a convenience, not science. Several other factors make determination too complex. They keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\u2022 Harm stories indicate people seem to think it just happened. Fatal error. Felt or not, effects can occur any time during or after exposure, so no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway.\\n\\u2022 An organization called EHS Idaho collects reports on incidence and effects in the Idaho population of electrohypersensitivity (EHS). Term misleading. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 suggested.\\n\\u2022 An estimated 35% of the Idaho population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. As bad as this is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad as things could quickly and easily get. Call this \\u201cpre-terminal disaster.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Illness caused by wireless radiation not new or unique to it, even though lists and categories of issues attributed to it.\\n\\u2022 Question: how much of today\\u2019s ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 all known prior to wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to wireless tech (or even the whole range of RF we \\u2019bathe\\u2019 in)?\\n\\u2022 If officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\u2022 For sick users \\u2014 much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\u2022 But quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\u2022 Manifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere.\\n\\u2022 If we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. I Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\u2022 One historical document acknowledging harm FCC denies is 1981 WHO report, Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973.\\n\\u2022 Very long report covers frequencies from 100 KHz to 300 GHz, but telecom/WiFi harm for last three decades has come from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\u2022 Quotes from document summary given, revealing ruthless deception. It\\u2019s all most people need to read. Section 1.1.6. admits safe level should be \\u201c\\u2026close to natural background levels\\u201d. Natural background microwave is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed).\\n\\nSo there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit after all: zero.\\n\\u2022 Safety \\u201cnot technically feasible.\\u201d Assumption that technology more important than environment and human health.\\n\\u2022 Notes and quotes from a presentation at 2009 Whole Health Expo reveal knowledge of harm since the 1950s.

What eventually became 2G.\\n\\u2022 Worth repeating: The most dire threat is to ecosystem, not humans. No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\u2022 threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. One thing is certain about most technology, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\u2022 Threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about process of creating it..\\n\\u2022 From resource acquisition (especially mining) to disposal, technology is toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless covers the whole process.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cWired\\u201d systems will not stop this assault.\\n\\u2022 The attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed.\\n\\u2022 If one isn\\u2019t careful, one might conclude \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers think humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\u2022 Most hysteria focused on ground antennas, while well more than 50,000 new satellites are underway and proposed, a horrific threat.\\n\\u2022 Heavy pollution produced by each launch, as well as massive removal of atmospheric oxygen. dynamic graph linked.\\n\\u2022 Much still up in the air on satellites.

There is an appeal to \\u2018stop 5G in space\\u2019, but popular emphasis remains disproportionately on ground installations.\\n\\u2022 Arrogant FCC has flatly dismissed legitimate concerns raised by NASA, NOAA and more. Does such arrogance suggest level of power beyond corporate/governmental?\\n\\u2022 Might such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates?\\n\\u2022 Best way to beat 5G on the ground is to reject all current wireless (3G/4G) at the commercial level. This could well impact satellites also.\\n\\u2022 Outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the ones on earthbound antennas.\\n\\u2022 Taking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\u2022 The race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse.

(majorly revised and updated). The full text is strongly encouraged; but two Summaries have been published for fast-trackers. This more detailed one, for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose, and a Text Summary for those who prefer a more general sweep. Both provide a means for seeing \\u201c5G\\u201d more clearly, and quickly accessing areas of particular interest.\\n\\nWhen you say, \\u201c5G\\u201d or \\u201dStop 5G,\\u201d please be sure you haven\\u2019t been misled about what it is, what you are opposing \\u2013 or want. Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts. This article attempts to raise some \\u2018dust\\u2019 and clear the air at the same time.\\n\\nBecause carrier rollouts and stories of harm are major opposition concerns, much detail is given to show how \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria makes things worse in various cases. Safety testing, history of official awareness of harm, and opposition priorities are also discussed.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Hysterical opposition to \\u201c5G\\u201d has created dangerous misconception, beginning with careless misuse of the very term \\u201c5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 When most people say \\u201c5G\\u201d they refer to its \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation, often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This is inaccurate, confusing and dangerous. EHF and 5G EHF are specified.\\n\\u2022 At least 4 Important distinctions must be kept in mind for understanding and discussing \\u201c5G,\\u201d especially one between the two 5G\\u2019s \\u2013 high frequency 5G and mid-band to low-band 5G.\\n\\u2022 Some terms are suggested to clear confusion and enhance discussion. \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d houses antennas. A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\u2022 Common, confusing warnings are discussed: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The term \\u201csmall cell\\u201d is misused, being applied to enclosures and/or fixtures instead of the area covered by antenna range. 5Gmmw has short range, thus its cell is small. \\u2018Making cases\\u2019.\\n\\u2022 MMW easily blocked, even by leaves and heavy rain, gets worse with increasing frequency requiring more fixture locations. Hysteria rarely notes that 5Gmlb is a large cell and is not blocked.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density. Common warnings about implementation are in serious question at this writing (more later).\\n\\u2022 Small cells are not new, not created for \\u201c5G\\u201d. There are traditionally three kinds.\\n\\u2022 From the outset: Opposition implies 5G is small cells/MMW. Typically careless statement given as example.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cThe skin\\u2019s sweat ducts act as receiving antennas for 5G\\u201d is speculative, based on a stretched interpretation of an Israeli study. Study details reviewed. Wording of its \\u201cwarning-flag\\u201d conclusion applies conceptually to all G\\u2019s. Harm was known decades before 2G (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\u2022 Insufficient correlation to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas. Making cases?\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G is a weapon\\u201d is based carelessly on the military\\u2019s ADS system that heats the skin. No correlation with commercial 5G mobile. MMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G.\\n\\u2022 2G began as a military weapon and was adapted to telecom. Entire wireless telecom system is a weapon.\\n\\u2022 All telecom/WiFi wireless frequencies, 2G-4G, will cook you at sufficiently high power levels. Telecom 5Gmmw at commercial levels will not.\\n\\u2022 A powerful Air Force radar system, Pave Paws, will cook you in a nanosecond at 450 MHz, so forget whine about \\u201c5G weapon.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 No ADS power range found, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study.\\n\\u2022 Power of microwave ovens and towers/phones compared. ADS configuration chosen to limit penetration depth.\\n\\u2022 No wattage output for 5G MLB or MMW antennas found, but did find Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of a 5Gmmw antenna for 28 and 38 GHz and compared with FCC standard.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G\\u201d per se opposition creates dangerous false sense of security encouraging continued use of pathological 3G/4G/WiFi wireless devices. Techno-humans adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G has not been safety tested\\u201d is a ploy. That the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d atrocities, whereas, the basic issue is wireless tech per se.\\n\\u2022 In 1996, FCC finally adopted ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992, covering frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range all MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019.\\n\\u2022 FCC assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is same fraud used to make assurances about 3G in 1996: \\u201cNo heat, no harm.\\u201d This author warned of this response to \\u201cStop 5G\\u201d in the 2/2019 article Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised?\\n\\u2022 Huge volume of science beginning in the 1950s brings up question whether *proper* testing was ever done.\\n\\u2022 FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science. This blatant criminality is clearly revealed by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 \\u201cCurrent FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d All official testing is fraud, can\\u2019t be \\u201coutdated.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 \\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing can exist.\\n\\u2022 More detail on the original testing cited two in sections of Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\u2022 Where infrastructure is concerned, emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA.\\u2019 But things seem to be developing differently. Even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\u2022 A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard covers two frequency ranges, FR1, FR2. One, for current bands below 6 GHz (3G/4G, i.e., 5Gmlb). Two, for 5Gmmw. WiFi remains separate for now\\n\\u2022 5G NR defines new protocols for MLB, providing at least 35% more 4G speed, while being called 5G without distinction. 5Gmlb can use same towers as 4G, has same range and penetration, but new antennas.\\n\\u2022 5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention, including \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and beamforming (more later).\\n\\u2022 Plans being made to market 5G in an unlicensed 3.5 GHz band of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service. MLB called 5G.\\n\\u2022 Apparently, current smartphones can be updated to process 5Gmlb; but 5Gmmw will require new (expensive) phones. Field tests: Samsung Galaxy S10 (good shot of 5Gmmw antenna/node in first article). Both advise \\u2018holding off\\u2019 on new, 5G phones.\\n\\u2022 Two possible motives behind \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria are addressed.\\n\\u2022 Two dissections of news stories causing 5G rollout confusion \\u2013 the UK\\u2019s 6/26/19 Glastonbury Festival and a notable 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland. Neither report clarifies which \\u201c5G\\u201d was involved.\\n\\u2022 Glastonbury protest article laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated hysteria that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Implied is that 2G-4G were not experiments. Paradox: They were and were not. Distinctions must be made.\\n\\u2022 Crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s.\\n\\u2022 Decision made long ago to put life/people at risk (see History of Official Awareness).Thus, thus the yes/no experiment is not IF harm, but when, and how the explosion will play out.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cGood\\u201d news: Human health collapse could be prevented \\u2013 by ecosystem collapse. Race is on.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s happening \\u2018on the ground.\\u2019 The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon.\\n\\u2022 Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. Verizon says this is MMW (5Gmmw). But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sacramento seems a most enthusiastic host. Website features Verizon UWB installation at citizen\\u2019s home, City officials attending. Sacramento also prides itself on attaining \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more below).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas \\u2013 could be its final destination.\\n\\u2022 Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason, with 3G/4G still operating. Again, the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\u2022 The forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. Drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for millions of closely spaced fixtures nationwide. There now seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\u2022 A report on new Qualcomm smartphone 5Gmmw antennas also covers antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\u2022 It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) is specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs say 4G can handle it. Probably 4Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 Some opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. The attempted deployment of smart utility meters on (4G) WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say.\\n\\u2022 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\u2022 I didn\\u2019t invest time trying to find where dense fixture locations are happening in neighborhoods. Rollout info suggests only populous areas. Readers who\\u2019ve seen this anywhere are asked to share in Comments.\\n\\u2022 If FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose.\\n\\u2022 Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams said in an interview that FLD is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d True, but not the whole truth. McAdam touted 5Gmmw for Smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality.\\n\\u2022 No matter the 5G version, wireless per se is the foundation for managing/controlling every aspect of daily life with \\u201cSmart\\u201d technology.\\n\\u2022 None of the above means things can\\u2019t change. MLB rollout could be precursor to an FLD/MMW invasion or satellite saturation in outlying areas. Speculation on MMW future and interface between ground and satellite purposes and services.\\n\\u2022 Parenthetical discussion of Sacramento-City web page showing total-surveillance/human-control system rapidly gestating under auspices of \\u201cSmart City for public safety/benefits\\u201d \\u2013 especially \\u201cProjects in Progress\\u201d. Note promise of \\u201cSTEM,\\u201d the nationwide programming for turning kids into corporate plug-ins.\\n\\u2022 STEM promises techno-shiny future, and exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. But the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum of the latter. Imagine the potential chaos once a Smart City become hackers target.\\n\\u2022 Mostly confusion in these reports, all implying 5Gmmw. No clear indication of which \\u201c5G\\u201d is involved in most cases \\u2013 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 People see new infrastructure and assume MMW.\\n\\u2022 All harms reported thus far are classic 2G-4G symptoms. Most are the \\u201cElectrohypersensitivity (EHS) type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\u2022 RF meters have been used to support claims of harm, but ordinary meters can\\u2019t read MMW. Such meters are professional, expensive, technical equipment.\\n\\u2022 A true 5G phone would ID MMW and MLB, but no meter shows frequencies, so even a pro one wouldn\\u2019t reveal which frequencies are present.\\n\\u2022 Long-term previous exposure plays into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Harm \\u201cverified\\u201d by ordinary meters proves 4G harm, one way or another.\\n\\u2022 One hawker claims its ordinary meter can read \\u201c5G,\\u201d a ruse brought to you by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 For most situations, meters not much use for most people \\u2013 no safe exposure level (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Meters sometimes useful for people using shielding, etc, but symptom improvement doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops..\\n\\u2022 Differences between MMW effects and long-reported classic 2G-4G effects can tentatively identify 5G frequency type.\\n\\u2022 MMW potentially threatens skin and eyes. A study irresponsibly (underhandedly?) cited in an article to prove \\u201c5G\\u201d has heart effects is exposed.\\n\\u2022 Study also implies that any microwave frequency at sufficient power can cook and kill you.\\n\\u2022 Possible, but still speculative, that 5Gmmw can cause MLB effects, because conductive body tissues can carry induced currents deep into the body.\\n\\u2022 MIMO (\\u2018my-mo\\u2019) antenna tech has been used for MLB for more than a decade. The new development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, or many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming beams of radiation.\\n\\u2022 One question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose a greater threat than traditional antennas. It\\u2019s possible. It seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of beams, although a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\u2022 Aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying beams avoids high power output per beam.\\n\\u2022 Hysteria often warns of an outrageously high increase in power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d For a few reasons, this seems unlikely.\\n\\u2022 Details of several typical news reports. Most demonstrate fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower will make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one, a general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\u2022 Story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from Verizon antenna installed near home illustrates confusion. Testimony before Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with mayor present.\\n\\u2022 Type of antenna not given, but probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\u2022 Strange that testimony date precedes stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests. Maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\u2022 Opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that mean? Incident suggests MMW effect, but still shows need to know what you mean when you say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although she commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but her suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness won\\u2019t be taken seriously.\\n\\u2022 Typically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\u2022 Even if new 5Gmlb antennas pose greater health risk, it\\u2019s academic, because the \\u2018pre-5G\\u2019 endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal.\\n\\u2022 Outrageous opposition-induced hysteria from Gateshead in UK about \\u201c5G\\u201d from street lights. Dangers of LED lights cited.\\n\\u2022 News report from Cincinnati shows folks in the dark about 5G, thanks to hysteria. Story from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, shows better awareness of wireless threat. Both show dangerous thinking about shutting down/moving tower (no one talking ecosystem).\\n\\u2022 An RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story, is cited as accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\u2022 Original 9/20/19 story (now includes update) a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria. No one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers previously. It\\u2019s a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that people fear will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d..\\n\\u2022 9/27/19 update shows interview with concerned nurse. \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacks understanding of wireless, will feel safer if that tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\u2022 Tall, new-look tower with cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video). Looks nothing like Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw antenna seen in phone report in the 5G Rollouts section.\\n\\u2022 Update also says it\\u2019s a Sprint tower, so can\\u2019t be MMW. \\u201c5G\\u201d fear an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s in cylindrical fixture and its specific functions are anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\u2022 Update also notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what?\\n\\u2022 3/12/19 San Joaquin report also concerns tall tower with cylindrical fixture \\u201ctoo close to school.\\u201d No 5G fear, more general awareness of wireless danger. \\u2018Cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\u2022 Three teachers and four students with various cancers since 2016 Also 22 year-old former male student. No mention of whether teachers and young man were exposed to any other towers/devices. Just that nasty tower\\u2026\\n\\u2022 Ripon case interesting for several reasons. Independent expert contradicted official assurance that tower tested OK. Shows common ignorance: \\u201c\\u2026kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sprint shut tower down, agreed to relocate. Good PR, suggests industry/towns will back down.\\n\\u2022 Two more reasons: First is overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure and probably cumulative effect (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Second reason, bogus advice \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the argument for slow death over quicker death, or futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can make things worse.\\n\\u2022 Any antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\u2022 Reducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usage tips and lower exposure limits. Both futile.\\n\\u2022 Reliance on power level to determine safety is largely a convenience, not science. Several other factors make determination too complex. They keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\u2022 Harm stories indicate people seem to think it just happened. Fatal error. Felt or not, effects can occur any time during or after exposure, so no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway.\\n\\u2022 An organization called EHS Idaho collects reports on incidence and effects in the Idaho population of electrohypersensitivity (EHS). Term misleading. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 suggested.\\n\\u2022 An estimated 35% of the Idaho population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. As bad as this is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad as things could quickly and easily get. Call this \\u201cpre-terminal disaster.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Illness caused by wireless radiation not new or unique to it, even though lists and categories of issues attributed to it.\\n\\u2022 Question: how much of today\\u2019s ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 all known prior to wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to wireless tech (or even the whole range of RF we \\u2019bathe\\u2019 in)?\\n\\u2022 If officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\u2022 For sick users \\u2014 much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\u2022 But quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\u2022 Manifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere.\\n\\u2022 If we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. I Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\u2022 One historical document acknowledging harm FCC denies is 1981 WHO report, Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973.\\n\\u2022 Very long report covers frequencies from 100 KHz to 300 GHz, but telecom/WiFi harm for last three decades has come from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\u2022 Quotes from document summary given, revealing ruthless deception. It\\u2019s all most people need to read. Section 1.1.6. admits safe level should be \\u201c\\u2026close to natural background levels\\u201d. Natural background microwave is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed).\\n\\nSo there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit after all: zero.\\n\\u2022 Safety \\u201cnot technically feasible.\\u201d Assumption that technology more important than environment and human health.\\n\\u2022 Notes and quotes from a presentation at 2009 Whole Health Expo reveal knowledge of harm since the 1950s. No indication in Summary if 1973 Warsaw Symposium or 1981 WHO reviewers were aware.\\n\\u2022 No indication in Summary that Symposium/WHO were aware of military microwave stealth-weapon research begun in 1950s. What eventually became 2G.\\n\\u2022 Worth repeating: The most dire threat is to ecosystem, not humans. No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\u2022 threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. One thing is certain about most technology, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\u2022 Threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about process of creating it..\\n\\u2022 From resource acquisition (especially mining) to disposal, technology is toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless covers the whole process.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cWired\\u201d systems will not stop this assault.\\n\\u2022 The attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed.\\n\\u2022 If one isn\\u2019t careful, one might conclude \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers think humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\u2022 Most hysteria focused on ground antennas, while well more than 50,000 new satellites are underway and proposed, a horrific threat.\\n\\u2022 Heavy pollution produced by each launch, as well as massive removal of atmospheric oxygen. dynamic graph linked.\\n\\u2022 Much still up in the air on satellites. Plan seems to be shoot them up first, answer proprietary questions later, dismissing anyone else\\u2019s.\\n\\u2022 In Europe there are calls for science papers on satellite/5G integration. There is an appeal to \\u2018stop 5G in space\\u2019, but popular emphasis remains disproportionately on ground installations.\\n\\u2022 Arrogant FCC has flatly dismissed legitimate concerns raised by NASA, NOAA and more. Does such arrogance suggest level of power beyond corporate/governmental?\\n\\u2022 Might such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates?\\n\\u2022 Best way to beat 5G on the ground is to reject all current wireless (3G/4G) at the commercial level. This could well impact satellites also.\\n\\u2022 Outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the ones on earthbound antennas.\\n\\u2022 Taking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\u2022 The race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse. Allowing classic 4G (or 5G FR1) to continue potentiates imminent disaster.\\n\\u2022 Experience shows that appeals, based on science, to governments at all levels; to national and international regulatory bodies, and so on is an exercise in futility.\\n\\u2022 It\\u2019s in the people\\u2019s hands. Give up wireless per se or give up the future \\u2013 liberty first, then life. If not, then welcome all 5G.

This more detailed one, for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose, and a Text Summary for those who prefer a more general sweep. Both provide a means for seeing \\u201c5G\\u201d more clearly, and quickly accessing areas of particular interest.\\n\\nWhen you say, \\u201c5G\\u201d or \\u201dStop 5G,\\u201d please be sure you haven\\u2019t been misled about what it is, what you are opposing \\u2013 or want. Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts. This article attempts to raise some \\u2018dust\\u2019 and clear the air at the same time.\\n\\nBecause carrier rollouts and stories of harm are major opposition concerns, much detail is given to show how \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria makes things worse in various cases. Safety testing, history of official awareness of harm, and opposition priorities are also discussed.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Hysterical opposition to \\u201c5G\\u201d has created dangerous misconception, beginning with careless misuse of the very term \\u201c5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 When most people say \\u201c5G\\u201d they refer to its \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation, often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This is inaccurate, confusing and dangerous. EHF and 5G EHF are specified.\\n\\u2022 At least 4 Important distinctions must be kept in mind for understanding and discussing \\u201c5G,\\u201d especially one between the two 5G\\u2019s \\u2013 high frequency 5G and mid-band to low-band 5G.\\n\\u2022 Some terms are suggested to clear confusion and enhance discussion. \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d houses antennas. A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\u2022 Common, confusing warnings are discussed: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The term \\u201csmall cell\\u201d is misused, being applied to enclosures and/or fixtures instead of the area covered by antenna range. 5Gmmw has short range, thus its cell is small. \\u2018Making cases\\u2019.\\n\\u2022 MMW easily blocked, even by leaves and heavy rain, gets worse with increasing frequency requiring more fixture locations. Hysteria rarely notes that 5Gmlb is a large cell and is not blocked.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density. Common warnings about implementation are in serious question at this writing (more later).\\n\\u2022 Small cells are not new, not created for \\u201c5G\\u201d. There are traditionally three kinds.\\n\\u2022 From the outset: Opposition implies 5G is small cells/MMW. Typically careless statement given as example.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cThe skin\\u2019s sweat ducts act as receiving antennas for 5G\\u201d is speculative, based on a stretched interpretation of an Israeli study. Study details reviewed. Wording of its \\u201cwarning-flag\\u201d conclusion applies conceptually to all G\\u2019s. Harm was known decades before 2G (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\u2022 Insufficient correlation to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas. Making cases?\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G is a weapon\\u201d is based carelessly on the military\\u2019s ADS system that heats the skin. No correlation with commercial 5G mobile. MMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G.\\n\\u2022 2G began as a military weapon and was adapted to telecom. Entire wireless telecom system is a weapon.\\n\\u2022 All telecom/WiFi wireless frequencies, 2G-4G, will cook you at sufficiently high power levels. Telecom 5Gmmw at commercial levels will not.\\n\\u2022 A powerful Air Force radar system, Pave Paws, will cook you in a nanosecond at 450 MHz, so forget whine about \\u201c5G weapon.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 No ADS power range found, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study.\\n\\u2022 Power of microwave ovens and towers/phones compared. ADS configuration chosen to limit penetration depth.\\n\\u2022 No wattage output for 5G MLB or MMW antennas found, but did find Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of a 5Gmmw antenna for 28 and 38 GHz and compared with FCC standard.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G\\u201d per se opposition creates dangerous false sense of security encouraging continued use of pathological 3G/4G/WiFi wireless devices. Techno-humans adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G has not been safety tested\\u201d is a ploy. That the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d atrocities, whereas, the basic issue is wireless tech per se.\\n\\u2022 In 1996, FCC finally adopted ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992, covering frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range all MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019.\\n\\u2022 FCC assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is same fraud used to make assurances about 3G in 1996: \\u201cNo heat, no harm.\\u201d This author warned of this response to \\u201cStop 5G\\u201d in the 2/2019 article Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised?\\n\\u2022 Huge volume of science beginning in the 1950s brings up question whether *proper* testing was ever done.\\n\\u2022 FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science. This blatant criminality is clearly revealed by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 \\u201cCurrent FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d All official testing is fraud, can\\u2019t be \\u201coutdated.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 \\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing can exist.\\n\\u2022 More detail on the original testing cited two in sections of Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\u2022 Where infrastructure is concerned, emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA.\\u2019 But things seem to be developing differently. Even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\u2022 A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard covers two frequency ranges, FR1, FR2. One, for current bands below 6 GHz (3G/4G, i.e., 5Gmlb). Two, for 5Gmmw. WiFi remains separate for now\\n\\u2022 5G NR defines new protocols for MLB, providing at least 35% more 4G speed, while being called 5G without distinction. 5Gmlb can use same towers as 4G, has same range and penetration, but new antennas.\\n\\u2022 5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention, including \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and beamforming (more later).\\n\\u2022 Plans being made to market 5G in an unlicensed 3.5 GHz band of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service. MLB called 5G.\\n\\u2022 Apparently, current smartphones can be updated to process 5Gmlb; but 5Gmmw will require new (expensive) phones. Field tests: Samsung Galaxy S10 (good shot of 5Gmmw antenna/node in first article). Both advise \\u2018holding off\\u2019 on new, 5G phones.\\n\\u2022 Two possible motives behind \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria are addressed.\\n\\u2022 Two dissections of news stories causing 5G rollout confusion \\u2013 the UK\\u2019s 6/26/19 Glastonbury Festival and a notable 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland. Neither report clarifies which \\u201c5G\\u201d was involved.\\n\\u2022 Glastonbury protest article laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated hysteria that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Implied is that 2G-4G were not experiments. Paradox: They were and were not. Distinctions must be made.\\n\\u2022 Crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s.\\n\\u2022 Decision made long ago to put life/people at risk (see History of Official Awareness).Thus, thus the yes/no experiment is not IF harm, but when, and how the explosion will play out.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cGood\\u201d news: Human health collapse could be prevented \\u2013 by ecosystem collapse. Race is on.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s happening \\u2018on the ground.\\u2019 The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon.\\n\\u2022 Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. Verizon says this is MMW (5Gmmw). But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sacramento seems a most enthusiastic host. Website features Verizon UWB installation at citizen\\u2019s home, City officials attending. Sacramento also prides itself on attaining \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more below).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas \\u2013 could be its final destination.\\n\\u2022 Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason, with 3G/4G still operating. Again, the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\u2022 The forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. Drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for millions of closely spaced fixtures nationwide. There now seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\u2022 A report on new Qualcomm smartphone 5Gmmw antennas also covers antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\u2022 It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) is specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs say 4G can handle it. Probably 4Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 Some opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. The attempted deployment of smart utility meters on (4G) WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say.\\n\\u2022 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\u2022 I didn\\u2019t invest time trying to find where dense fixture locations are happening in neighborhoods. Rollout info suggests only populous areas. Readers who\\u2019ve seen this anywhere are asked to share in Comments.\\n\\u2022 If FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose.\\n\\u2022 Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams said in an interview that FLD is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d True, but not the whole truth. McAdam touted 5Gmmw for Smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality.\\n\\u2022 No matter the 5G version, wireless per se is the foundation for managing/controlling every aspect of daily life with \\u201cSmart\\u201d technology.\\n\\u2022 None of the above means things can\\u2019t change. MLB rollout could be precursor to an FLD/MMW invasion or satellite saturation in outlying areas. Speculation on MMW future and interface between ground and satellite purposes and services.\\n\\u2022 Parenthetical discussion of Sacramento-City web page showing total-surveillance/human-control system rapidly gestating under auspices of \\u201cSmart City for public safety/benefits\\u201d \\u2013 especially \\u201cProjects in Progress\\u201d. Note promise of \\u201cSTEM,\\u201d the nationwide programming for turning kids into corporate plug-ins.\\n\\u2022 STEM promises techno-shiny future, and exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. But the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum of the latter. Imagine the potential chaos once a Smart City become hackers target.\\n\\u2022 Mostly confusion in these reports, all implying 5Gmmw. No clear indication of which \\u201c5G\\u201d is involved in most cases \\u2013 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 People see new infrastructure and assume MMW.\\n\\u2022 All harms reported thus far are classic 2G-4G symptoms. Most are the \\u201cElectrohypersensitivity (EHS) type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\u2022 RF meters have been used to support claims of harm, but ordinary meters can\\u2019t read MMW. Such meters are professional, expensive, technical equipment.\\n\\u2022 A true 5G phone would ID MMW and MLB, but no meter shows frequencies, so even a pro one wouldn\\u2019t reveal which frequencies are present.\\n\\u2022 Long-term previous exposure plays into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Harm \\u201cverified\\u201d by ordinary meters proves 4G harm, one way or another.\\n\\u2022 One hawker claims its ordinary meter can read \\u201c5G,\\u201d a ruse brought to you by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 For most situations, meters not much use for most people \\u2013 no safe exposure level (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Meters sometimes useful for people using shielding, etc, but symptom improvement doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops..\\n\\u2022 Differences between MMW effects and long-reported classic 2G-4G effects can tentatively identify 5G frequency type.\\n\\u2022 MMW potentially threatens skin and eyes. A study irresponsibly (underhandedly?) cited in an article to prove \\u201c5G\\u201d has heart effects is exposed.\\n\\u2022 Study also implies that any microwave frequency at sufficient power can cook and kill you.\\n\\u2022 Possible, but still speculative, that 5Gmmw can cause MLB effects, because conductive body tissues can carry induced currents deep into the body.\\n\\u2022 MIMO (\\u2018my-mo\\u2019) antenna tech has been used for MLB for more than a decade. The new development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, or many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming beams of radiation.\\n\\u2022 One question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose a greater threat than traditional antennas. It\\u2019s possible. It seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of beams, although a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\u2022 Aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying beams avoids high power output per beam.\\n\\u2022 Hysteria often warns of an outrageously high increase in power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d For a few reasons, this seems unlikely.\\n\\u2022 Details of several typical news reports. Most demonstrate fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower will make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one, a general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\u2022 Story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from Verizon antenna installed near home illustrates confusion. Testimony before Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with mayor present.\\n\\u2022 Type of antenna not given, but probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\u2022 Strange that testimony date precedes stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests. Maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\u2022 Opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that mean? Incident suggests MMW effect, but still shows need to know what you mean when you say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although she commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but her suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness won\\u2019t be taken seriously.\\n\\u2022 Typically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\u2022 Even if new 5Gmlb antennas pose greater health risk, it\\u2019s academic, because the \\u2018pre-5G\\u2019 endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal.\\n\\u2022 Outrageous opposition-induced hysteria from Gateshead in UK about \\u201c5G\\u201d from street lights. Dangers of LED lights cited.\\n\\u2022 News report from Cincinnati shows folks in the dark about 5G, thanks to hysteria. Story from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, shows better awareness of wireless threat. Both show dangerous thinking about shutting down/moving tower (no one talking ecosystem).\\n\\u2022 An RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story, is cited as accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\u2022 Original 9/20/19 story (now includes update) a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria. No one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers previously. It\\u2019s a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that people fear will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d..\\n\\u2022 9/27/19 update shows interview with concerned nurse. \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacks understanding of wireless, will feel safer if that tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\u2022 Tall, new-look tower with cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video). Looks nothing like Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw antenna seen in phone report in the 5G Rollouts section.\\n\\u2022 Update also says it\\u2019s a Sprint tower, so can\\u2019t be MMW. \\u201c5G\\u201d fear an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s in cylindrical fixture and its specific functions are anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\u2022 Update also notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what?\\n\\u2022 3/12/19 San Joaquin report also concerns tall tower with cylindrical fixture \\u201ctoo close to school.\\u201d No 5G fear, more general awareness of wireless danger. \\u2018Cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\u2022 Three teachers and four students with various cancers since 2016 Also 22 year-old former male student. No mention of whether teachers and young man were exposed to any other towers/devices. Just that nasty tower\\u2026\\n\\u2022 Ripon case interesting for several reasons. Independent expert contradicted official assurance that tower tested OK. Shows common ignorance: \\u201c\\u2026kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sprint shut tower down, agreed to relocate. Good PR, suggests industry/towns will back down.\\n\\u2022 Two more reasons: First is overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure and probably cumulative effect (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Second reason, bogus advice \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the argument for slow death over quicker death, or futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can make things worse.\\n\\u2022 Any antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\u2022 Reducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usage tips and lower exposure limits. Both futile.\\n\\u2022 Reliance on power level to determine safety is largely a convenience, not science. Several other factors make determination too complex. They keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\u2022 Harm stories indicate people seem to think it just happened. Fatal error. Felt or not, effects can occur any time during or after exposure, so no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway.\\n\\u2022 An organization called EHS Idaho collects reports on incidence and effects in the Idaho population of electrohypersensitivity (EHS). Term misleading. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 suggested.\\n\\u2022 An estimated 35% of the Idaho population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally.

Call this \\u201cpre-terminal disaster.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Illness caused by wireless radiation not new or unique to it, even though lists and categories of issues attributed to it.\\n\\u2022 Question: how much of today\\u2019s ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 all known prior to wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to wireless tech (or even the whole range of RF we \\u2019bathe\\u2019 in)?\\n\\u2022 If officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\u2022 For sick users \\u2014 much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\u2022 But quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\u2022 Manifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7.

(majorly revised and updated). The full text is strongly encouraged; but two Summaries have been published for fast-trackers. This more detailed one, for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose, and a Text Summary for those who prefer a more general sweep. Both provide a means for seeing \\u201c5G\\u201d more clearly, and quickly accessing areas of particular interest.\\n\\nWhen you say, \\u201c5G\\u201d or \\u201dStop 5G,\\u201d please be sure you haven\\u2019t been misled about what it is, what you are opposing \\u2013 or want. Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts. This article attempts to raise some \\u2018dust\\u2019 and clear the air at the same time.\\n\\nBecause carrier rollouts and stories of harm are major opposition concerns, much detail is given to show how \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria makes things worse in various cases. Safety testing, history of official awareness of harm, and opposition priorities are also discussed.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Hysterical opposition to \\u201c5G\\u201d has created dangerous misconception, beginning with careless misuse of the very term \\u201c5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 When most people say \\u201c5G\\u201d they refer to its \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation, often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This is inaccurate, confusing and dangerous. EHF and 5G EHF are specified.\\n\\u2022 At least 4 Important distinctions must be kept in mind for understanding and discussing \\u201c5G,\\u201d especially one between the two 5G\\u2019s \\u2013 high frequency 5G and mid-band to low-band 5G.\\n\\u2022 Some terms are suggested to clear confusion and enhance discussion. \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d houses antennas. A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\u2022 Common, confusing warnings are discussed: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The term \\u201csmall cell\\u201d is misused, being applied to enclosures and/or fixtures instead of the area covered by antenna range. 5Gmmw has short range, thus its cell is small. \\u2018Making cases\\u2019.\\n\\u2022 MMW easily blocked, even by leaves and heavy rain, gets worse with increasing frequency requiring more fixture locations. Hysteria rarely notes that 5Gmlb is a large cell and is not blocked.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density. Common warnings about implementation are in serious question at this writing (more later).\\n\\u2022 Small cells are not new, not created for \\u201c5G\\u201d. There are traditionally three kinds.\\n\\u2022 From the outset: Opposition implies 5G is small cells/MMW. Typically careless statement given as example.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cThe skin\\u2019s sweat ducts act as receiving antennas for 5G\\u201d is speculative, based on a stretched interpretation of an Israeli study. Study details reviewed. Wording of its \\u201cwarning-flag\\u201d conclusion applies conceptually to all G\\u2019s. Harm was known decades before 2G (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\u2022 Insufficient correlation to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas. Making cases?\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G is a weapon\\u201d is based carelessly on the military\\u2019s ADS system that heats the skin. No correlation with commercial 5G mobile. MMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G.\\n\\u2022 2G began as a military weapon and was adapted to telecom. Entire wireless telecom system is a weapon.\\n\\u2022 All telecom/WiFi wireless frequencies, 2G-4G, will cook you at sufficiently high power levels. Telecom 5Gmmw at commercial levels will not.\\n\\u2022 A powerful Air Force radar system, Pave Paws, will cook you in a nanosecond at 450 MHz, so forget whine about \\u201c5G weapon.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 No ADS power range found, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study.\\n\\u2022 Power of microwave ovens and towers/phones compared. ADS configuration chosen to limit penetration depth.\\n\\u2022 No wattage output for 5G MLB or MMW antennas found, but did find Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of a 5Gmmw antenna for 28 and 38 GHz and compared with FCC standard.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G\\u201d per se opposition creates dangerous false sense of security encouraging continued use of pathological 3G/4G/WiFi wireless devices. Techno-humans adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G has not been safety tested\\u201d is a ploy. That the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d atrocities, whereas, the basic issue is wireless tech per se.\\n\\u2022 In 1996, FCC finally adopted ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992, covering frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range all MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019.\\n\\u2022 FCC assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is same fraud used to make assurances about 3G in 1996: \\u201cNo heat, no harm.\\u201d This author warned of this response to \\u201cStop 5G\\u201d in the 2/2019 article Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised?\\n\\u2022 Huge volume of science beginning in the 1950s brings up question whether *proper* testing was ever done.\\n\\u2022 FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science. This blatant criminality is clearly revealed by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 \\u201cCurrent FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d All official testing is fraud, can\\u2019t be \\u201coutdated.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 \\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing can exist.\\n\\u2022 More detail on the original testing cited two in sections of Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\u2022 Where infrastructure is concerned, emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA.\\u2019 But things seem to be developing differently. Even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\u2022 A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard covers two frequency ranges, FR1, FR2. One, for current bands below 6 GHz (3G/4G, i.e., 5Gmlb). Two, for 5Gmmw. WiFi remains separate for now\\n\\u2022 5G NR defines new protocols for MLB, providing at least 35% more 4G speed, while being called 5G without distinction. 5Gmlb can use same towers as 4G, has same range and penetration, but new antennas.\\n\\u2022 5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention, including \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and beamforming (more later).\\n\\u2022 Plans being made to market 5G in an unlicensed 3.5 GHz band of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service. MLB called 5G.\\n\\u2022 Apparently, current smartphones can be updated to process 5Gmlb; but 5Gmmw will require new (expensive) phones. Field tests: Samsung Galaxy S10 (good shot of 5Gmmw antenna/node in first article). Both advise \\u2018holding off\\u2019 on new, 5G phones.\\n\\u2022 Two possible motives behind \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria are addressed.\\n\\u2022 Two dissections of news stories causing 5G rollout confusion \\u2013 the UK\\u2019s 6/26/19 Glastonbury Festival and a notable 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland. Neither report clarifies which \\u201c5G\\u201d was involved.\\n\\u2022 Glastonbury protest article laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated hysteria that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Implied is that 2G-4G were not experiments. Paradox: They were and were not. Distinctions must be made.\\n\\u2022 Crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s.\\n\\u2022 Decision made long ago to put life/people at risk (see History of Official Awareness).Thus, thus the yes/no experiment is not IF harm, but when, and how the explosion will play out.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cGood\\u201d news: Human health collapse could be prevented \\u2013 by ecosystem collapse. Race is on.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s happening \\u2018on the ground.\\u2019 The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon.\\n\\u2022 Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. Verizon says this is MMW (5Gmmw). But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sacramento seems a most enthusiastic host. Website features Verizon UWB installation at citizen\\u2019s home, City officials attending. Sacramento also prides itself on attaining \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more below).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas \\u2013 could be its final destination.\\n\\u2022 Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason, with 3G/4G still operating. Again, the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\u2022 The forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. Drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for millions of closely spaced fixtures nationwide. There now seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\u2022 A report on new Qualcomm smartphone 5Gmmw antennas also covers antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\u2022 It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) is specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs say 4G can handle it. Probably 4Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 Some opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. The attempted deployment of smart utility meters on (4G) WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say.\\n\\u2022 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\u2022 I didn\\u2019t invest time trying to find where dense fixture locations are happening in neighborhoods. Rollout info suggests only populous areas. Readers who\\u2019ve seen this anywhere are asked to share in Comments.\\n\\u2022 If FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose.\\n\\u2022 Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams said in an interview that FLD is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d True, but not the whole truth. McAdam touted 5Gmmw for Smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality.\\n\\u2022 No matter the 5G version, wireless per se is the foundation for managing/controlling every aspect of daily life with \\u201cSmart\\u201d technology.\\n\\u2022 None of the above means things can\\u2019t change. MLB rollout could be precursor to an FLD/MMW invasion or satellite saturation in outlying areas. Speculation on MMW future and interface between ground and satellite purposes and services.\\n\\u2022 Parenthetical discussion of Sacramento-City web page showing total-surveillance/human-control system rapidly gestating under auspices of \\u201cSmart City for public safety/benefits\\u201d \\u2013 especially \\u201cProjects in Progress\\u201d. Note promise of \\u201cSTEM,\\u201d the nationwide programming for turning kids into corporate plug-ins.\\n\\u2022 STEM promises techno-shiny future, and exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. But the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum of the latter. Imagine the potential chaos once a Smart City become hackers target.\\n\\u2022 Mostly confusion in these reports, all implying 5Gmmw. No clear indication of which \\u201c5G\\u201d is involved in most cases \\u2013 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 People see new infrastructure and assume MMW.\\n\\u2022 All harms reported thus far are classic 2G-4G symptoms. Most are the \\u201cElectrohypersensitivity (EHS) type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\u2022 RF meters have been used to support claims of harm, but ordinary meters can\\u2019t read MMW. Such meters are professional, expensive, technical equipment.\\n\\u2022 A true 5G phone would ID MMW and MLB, but no meter shows frequencies, so even a pro one wouldn\\u2019t reveal which frequencies are present.\\n\\u2022 Long-term previous exposure plays into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Harm \\u201cverified\\u201d by ordinary meters proves 4G harm, one way or another.\\n\\u2022 One hawker claims its ordinary meter can read \\u201c5G,\\u201d a ruse brought to you by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 For most situations, meters not much use for most people \\u2013 no safe exposure level (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Meters sometimes useful for people using shielding, etc, but symptom improvement doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops..\\n\\u2022 Differences between MMW effects and long-reported classic 2G-4G effects can tentatively identify 5G frequency type.\\n\\u2022 MMW potentially threatens skin and eyes. A study irresponsibly (underhandedly?) cited in an article to prove \\u201c5G\\u201d has heart effects is exposed.\\n\\u2022 Study also implies that any microwave frequency at sufficient power can cook and kill you.\\n\\u2022 Possible, but still speculative, that 5Gmmw can cause MLB effects, because conductive body tissues can carry induced currents deep into the body.\\n\\u2022 MIMO (\\u2018my-mo\\u2019) antenna tech has been used for MLB for more than a decade. The new development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, or many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming beams of radiation.\\n\\u2022 One question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose a greater threat than traditional antennas. It\\u2019s possible. It seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of beams, although a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\u2022 Aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying beams avoids high power output per beam.\\n\\u2022 Hysteria often warns of an outrageously high increase in power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d For a few reasons, this seems unlikely.\\n\\u2022 Details of several typical news reports. Most demonstrate fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower will make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one, a general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\u2022 Story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from Verizon antenna installed near home illustrates confusion. Testimony before Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with mayor present.\\n\\u2022 Type of antenna not given, but probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\u2022 Strange that testimony date precedes stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests.

Story from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, shows better awareness of wireless threat. Both show dangerous thinking about shutting down/moving tower (no one talking ecosystem).\\n\\u2022 An RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story, is cited as accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\u2022 Original 9/20/19 story (now includes update) a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria. No one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers previously.

Good PR, suggests industry/towns will back down.\\n\\u2022 Two more reasons: First is overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure and probably cumulative effect (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Second reason, bogus advice \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the argument for slow death over quicker death, or futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can make things worse.\\n\\u2022 Any antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\u2022 Reducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usage tips and lower exposure limits. Both futile.\\n\\u2022 Reliance on power level to determine safety is largely a convenience, not science. Several other factors make determination too complex. They keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\u2022 Harm stories indicate people seem to think it just happened. Fatal error.

I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\u2022 For sick users \\u2014 much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\u2022 But quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\u2022 Manifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7.

(majorly revised and updated). The full text is strongly encouraged; but two Summaries have been published for fast-trackers. This more detailed one, for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose, and a Text Summary for those who prefer a more general sweep. Both provide a means for seeing \\u201c5G\\u201d more clearly, and quickly accessing areas of particular interest.\\n\\nWhen you say, \\u201c5G\\u201d or \\u201dStop 5G,\\u201d please be sure you haven\\u2019t been misled about what it is, what you are opposing \\u2013 or want. Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts. This article attempts to raise some \\u2018dust\\u2019 and clear the air at the same time.\\n\\nBecause carrier rollouts and stories of harm are major opposition concerns, much detail is given to show how \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria makes things worse in various cases. Safety testing, history of official awareness of harm, and opposition priorities are also discussed.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Hysterical opposition to \\u201c5G\\u201d has created dangerous misconception, beginning with careless misuse of the very term \\u201c5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 When most people say \\u201c5G\\u201d they refer to its \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation, often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This is inaccurate, confusing and dangerous. EHF and 5G EHF are specified.\\n\\u2022 At least 4 Important distinctions must be kept in mind for understanding and discussing \\u201c5G,\\u201d especially one between the two 5G\\u2019s \\u2013 high frequency 5G and mid-band to low-band 5G.\\n\\u2022 Some terms are suggested to clear confusion and enhance discussion. \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d houses antennas. A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\u2022 Common, confusing warnings are discussed: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The term \\u201csmall cell\\u201d is misused, being applied to enclosures and/or fixtures instead of the area covered by antenna range. 5Gmmw has short range, thus its cell is small. \\u2018Making cases\\u2019.\\n\\u2022 MMW easily blocked, even by leaves and heavy rain, gets worse with increasing frequency requiring more fixture locations. Hysteria rarely notes that 5Gmlb is a large cell and is not blocked.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density. Common warnings about implementation are in serious question at this writing (more later).\\n\\u2022 Small cells are not new, not created for \\u201c5G\\u201d. There are traditionally three kinds.\\n\\u2022 From the outset: Opposition implies 5G is small cells/MMW. Typically careless statement given as example.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cThe skin\\u2019s sweat ducts act as receiving antennas for 5G\\u201d is speculative, based on a stretched interpretation of an Israeli study. Study details reviewed. Wording of its \\u201cwarning-flag\\u201d conclusion applies conceptually to all G\\u2019s. Harm was known decades before 2G (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\u2022 Insufficient correlation to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas. Making cases?\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G is a weapon\\u201d is based carelessly on the military\\u2019s ADS system that heats the skin. No correlation with commercial 5G mobile. MMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G.\\n\\u2022 2G began as a military weapon and was adapted to telecom. Entire wireless telecom system is a weapon.\\n\\u2022 All telecom/WiFi wireless frequencies, 2G-4G, will cook you at sufficiently high power levels. Telecom 5Gmmw at commercial levels will not.\\n\\u2022 A powerful Air Force radar system, Pave Paws, will cook you in a nanosecond at 450 MHz, so forget whine about \\u201c5G weapon.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 No ADS power range found, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study.\\n\\u2022 Power of microwave ovens and towers/phones compared. ADS configuration chosen to limit penetration depth.\\n\\u2022 No wattage output for 5G MLB or MMW antennas found, but did find Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of a 5Gmmw antenna for 28 and 38 GHz and compared with FCC standard.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G\\u201d per se opposition creates dangerous false sense of security encouraging continued use of pathological 3G/4G/WiFi wireless devices. Techno-humans adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G has not been safety tested\\u201d is a ploy. That the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d atrocities, whereas, the basic issue is wireless tech per se.\\n\\u2022 In 1996, FCC finally adopted ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992, covering frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range all MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019.\\n\\u2022 FCC assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is same fraud used to make assurances about 3G in 1996: \\u201cNo heat, no harm.\\u201d This author warned of this response to \\u201cStop 5G\\u201d in the 2/2019 article Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised?\\n\\u2022 Huge volume of science beginning in the 1950s brings up question whether *proper* testing was ever done.\\n\\u2022 FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science. This blatant criminality is clearly revealed by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 \\u201cCurrent FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d All official testing is fraud, can\\u2019t be \\u201coutdated.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 \\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing can exist.\\n\\u2022 More detail on the original testing cited two in sections of Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\u2022 Where infrastructure is concerned, emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA.\\u2019 But things seem to be developing differently. Even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\u2022 A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard covers two frequency ranges, FR1, FR2. One, for current bands below 6 GHz (3G/4G, i.e., 5Gmlb). Two, for 5Gmmw. WiFi remains separate for now\\n\\u2022 5G NR defines new protocols for MLB, providing at least 35% more 4G speed, while being called 5G without distinction. 5Gmlb can use same towers as 4G, has same range and penetration, but new antennas.\\n\\u2022 5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention, including \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and beamforming (more later).\\n\\u2022 Plans being made to market 5G in an unlicensed 3.5 GHz band of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service. MLB called 5G.\\n\\u2022 Apparently, current smartphones can be updated to process 5Gmlb; but 5Gmmw will require new (expensive) phones. Field tests: Samsung Galaxy S10 (good shot of 5Gmmw antenna/node in first article). Both advise \\u2018holding off\\u2019 on new, 5G phones.\\n\\u2022 Two possible motives behind \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria are addressed.\\n\\u2022 Two dissections of news stories causing 5G rollout confusion \\u2013 the UK\\u2019s 6/26/19 Glastonbury Festival and a notable 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland. Neither report clarifies which \\u201c5G\\u201d was involved.\\n\\u2022 Glastonbury protest article laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated hysteria that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Implied is that 2G-4G were not experiments. Paradox: They were and were not. Distinctions must be made.\\n\\u2022 Crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s.\\n\\u2022 Decision made long ago to put life/people at risk (see History of Official Awareness).Thus, thus the yes/no experiment is not IF harm, but when, and how the explosion will play out.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cGood\\u201d news: Human health collapse could be prevented \\u2013 by ecosystem collapse. Race is on.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s happening \\u2018on the ground.\\u2019 The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon.\\n\\u2022 Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. Verizon says this is MMW (5Gmmw). But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sacramento seems a most enthusiastic host. Website features Verizon UWB installation at citizen\\u2019s home, City officials attending. Sacramento also prides itself on attaining \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more below).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas \\u2013 could be its final destination.\\n\\u2022 Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason, with 3G/4G still operating. Again, the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\u2022 The forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. Drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for millions of closely spaced fixtures nationwide. There now seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\u2022 A report on new Qualcomm smartphone 5Gmmw antennas also covers antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\u2022 It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) is specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs say 4G can handle it. Probably 4Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 Some opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. The attempted deployment of smart utility meters on (4G) WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say.\\n\\u2022 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\u2022 I didn\\u2019t invest time trying to find where dense fixture locations are happening in neighborhoods. Rollout info suggests only populous areas. Readers who\\u2019ve seen this anywhere are asked to share in Comments.\\n\\u2022 If FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose.\\n\\u2022 Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams said in an interview that FLD is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d True, but not the whole truth. McAdam touted 5Gmmw for Smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality.\\n\\u2022 No matter the 5G version, wireless per se is the foundation for managing/controlling every aspect of daily life with \\u201cSmart\\u201d technology.\\n\\u2022 None of the above means things can\\u2019t change. MLB rollout could be precursor to an FLD/MMW invasion or satellite saturation in outlying areas. Speculation on MMW future and interface between ground and satellite purposes and services.\\n\\u2022 Parenthetical discussion of Sacramento-City web page showing total-surveillance/human-control system rapidly gestating under auspices of \\u201cSmart City for public safety/benefits\\u201d \\u2013 especially \\u201cProjects in Progress\\u201d. Note promise of \\u201cSTEM,\\u201d the nationwide programming for turning kids into corporate plug-ins.\\n\\u2022 STEM promises techno-shiny future, and exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. But the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum of the latter. Imagine the potential chaos once a Smart City become hackers target.\\n\\u2022 Mostly confusion in these reports, all implying 5Gmmw. No clear indication of which \\u201c5G\\u201d is involved in most cases \\u2013 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 People see new infrastructure and assume MMW.\\n\\u2022 All harms reported thus far are classic 2G-4G symptoms. Most are the \\u201cElectrohypersensitivity (EHS) type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\u2022 RF meters have been used to support claims of harm, but ordinary meters can\\u2019t read MMW. Such meters are professional, expensive, technical equipment.\\n\\u2022 A true 5G phone would ID MMW and MLB, but no meter shows frequencies, so even a pro one wouldn\\u2019t reveal which frequencies are present.\\n\\u2022 Long-term previous exposure plays into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Harm \\u201cverified\\u201d by ordinary meters proves 4G harm, one way or another.\\n\\u2022 One hawker claims its ordinary meter can read \\u201c5G,\\u201d a ruse brought to you by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 For most situations, meters not much use for most people \\u2013 no safe exposure level (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Meters sometimes useful for people using shielding, etc, but symptom improvement doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops..\\n\\u2022 Differences between MMW effects and long-reported classic 2G-4G effects can tentatively identify 5G frequency type.\\n\\u2022 MMW potentially threatens skin and eyes. A study irresponsibly (underhandedly?) cited in an article to prove \\u201c5G\\u201d has heart effects is exposed.\\n\\u2022 Study also implies that any microwave frequency at sufficient power can cook and kill you.\\n\\u2022 Possible, but still speculative, that 5Gmmw can cause MLB effects, because conductive body tissues can carry induced currents deep into the body.\\n\\u2022 MIMO (\\u2018my-mo\\u2019) antenna tech has been used for MLB for more than a decade. The new development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, or many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming beams of radiation.\\n\\u2022 One question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose a greater threat than traditional antennas. It\\u2019s possible. It seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of beams, although a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\u2022 Aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying beams avoids high power output per beam.\\n\\u2022 Hysteria often warns of an outrageously high increase in power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d For a few reasons, this seems unlikely.\\n\\u2022 Details of several typical news reports. Most demonstrate fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower will make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one, a general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\u2022 Story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from Verizon antenna installed near home illustrates confusion. Testimony before Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with mayor present.\\n\\u2022 Type of antenna not given, but probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\u2022 Strange that testimony date precedes stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests. Maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\u2022 Opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that mean? Incident suggests MMW effect, but still shows need to know what you mean when you say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although she commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but her suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness won\\u2019t be taken seriously.\\n\\u2022 Typically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\u2022 Even if new 5Gmlb antennas pose greater health risk, it\\u2019s academic, because the \\u2018pre-5G\\u2019 endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal.\\n\\u2022 Outrageous opposition-induced hysteria from Gateshead in UK about \\u201c5G\\u201d from street lights. Dangers of LED lights cited.\\n\\u2022 News report from Cincinnati shows folks in the dark about 5G, thanks to hysteria. Story from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, shows better awareness of wireless threat. Both show dangerous thinking about shutting down/moving tower (no one talking ecosystem).\\n\\u2022 An RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story, is cited as accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\u2022 Original 9/20/19 story (now includes update) a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria. No one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers previously. It\\u2019s a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that people fear will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d..\\n\\u2022 9/27/19 update shows interview with concerned nurse. \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacks understanding of wireless, will feel safer if that tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\u2022 Tall, new-look tower with cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video). Looks nothing like Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw antenna seen in phone report in the 5G Rollouts section.\\n\\u2022 Update also says it\\u2019s a Sprint tower, so can\\u2019t be MMW. \\u201c5G\\u201d fear an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s in cylindrical fixture and its specific functions are anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\u2022 Update also notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what?\\n\\u2022 3/12/19 San Joaquin report also concerns tall tower with cylindrical fixture \\u201ctoo close to school.\\u201d No 5G fear, more general awareness of wireless danger. \\u2018Cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\u2022 Three teachers and four students with various cancers since 2016 Also 22 year-old former male student. No mention of whether teachers and young man were exposed to any other towers/devices. Just that nasty tower\\u2026\\n\\u2022 Ripon case interesting for several reasons. Independent expert contradicted official assurance that tower tested OK. Shows common ignorance: \\u201c\\u2026kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sprint shut tower down, agreed to relocate. Good PR, suggests industry/towns will back down.\\n\\u2022 Two more reasons: First is overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure and probably cumulative effect (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Second reason, bogus advice \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the argument for slow death over quicker death, or futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can make things worse.\\n\\u2022 Any antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\u2022 Reducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usage tips and lower exposure limits. Both futile.\\n\\u2022 Reliance on power level to determine safety is largely a convenience, not science. Several other factors make determination too complex. They keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\u2022 Harm stories indicate people seem to think it just happened. Fatal error. Felt or not, effects can occur any time during or after exposure, so no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway.\\n\\u2022 An organization called EHS Idaho collects reports on incidence and effects in the Idaho population of electrohypersensitivity (EHS). Term misleading. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 suggested.\\n\\u2022 An estimated 35% of the Idaho population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. As bad as this is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad as things could quickly and easily get. Call this \\u201cpre-terminal disaster.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Illness caused by wireless radiation not new or unique to it, even though lists and categories of issues attributed to it.\\n\\u2022 Question: how much of today\\u2019s ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 all known prior to wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to wireless tech (or even the whole range of RF we \\u2019bathe\\u2019 in)?\\n\\u2022 If officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\u2022 For sick users \\u2014 much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\u2022 But quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\u2022 Manifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere.\\n\\u2022 If we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. I Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\u2022 One historical document acknowledging harm FCC denies is 1981 WHO report, Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973.\\n\\u2022 Very long report covers frequencies from 100 KHz to 300 GHz, but telecom/WiFi harm for last three decades has come from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\u2022 Quotes from document summary given, revealing ruthless deception. It\\u2019s all most people need to read. Section 1.1.6. admits safe level should be \\u201c\\u2026close to natural background levels\\u201d.

No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\u2022 threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. One thing is certain about most technology, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\u2022 Threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about process of creating it..\\n\\u2022 From resource acquisition (especially mining) to disposal, technology is toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless covers the whole process.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cWired\\u201d systems will not stop this assault.\\n\\u2022 The attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed.\\n\\u2022 If one isn\\u2019t careful, one might conclude \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers think humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\u2022 Most hysteria focused on ground antennas, while well more than 50,000 new satellites are underway and proposed, a horrific threat.\\n\\u2022 Heavy pollution produced by each launch, as well as massive removal of atmospheric oxygen. dynamic graph linked.\\n\\u2022 Much still up in the air on satellites.

There is an appeal to \\u2018stop 5G in space\\u2019, but popular emphasis remains disproportionately on ground installations.\\n\\u2022 Arrogant FCC has flatly dismissed legitimate concerns raised by NASA, NOAA and more. Does such arrogance suggest level of power beyond corporate/governmental?\\n\\u2022 Might such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates?\\n\\u2022 Best way to beat 5G on the ground is to reject all current wireless (3G/4G) at the commercial level.

Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts. This article attempts to raise some \\u2018dust\\u2019 and clear the air at the same time.\\n\\nBecause carrier rollouts and stories of harm are major opposition concerns, much detail is given to show how \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria makes things worse in various cases. Safety testing, history of official awareness of harm, and opposition priorities are also discussed.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Hysterical opposition to \\u201c5G\\u201d has created dangerous misconception, beginning with careless misuse of the very term \\u201c5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 When most people say \\u201c5G\\u201d they refer to its \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation, often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This is inaccurate, confusing and dangerous. EHF and 5G EHF are specified.\\n\\u2022 At least 4 Important distinctions must be kept in mind for understanding and discussing \\u201c5G,\\u201d especially one between the two 5G\\u2019s \\u2013 high frequency 5G and mid-band to low-band 5G.\\n\\u2022 Some terms are suggested to clear confusion and enhance discussion. \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d houses antennas. A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\u2022 Common, confusing warnings are discussed: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The term \\u201csmall cell\\u201d is misused, being applied to enclosures and/or fixtures instead of the area covered by antenna range. 5Gmmw has short range, thus its cell is small. \\u2018Making cases\\u2019.\\n\\u2022 MMW easily blocked, even by leaves and heavy rain, gets worse with increasing frequency requiring more fixture locations. Hysteria rarely notes that 5Gmlb is a large cell and is not blocked.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density. Common warnings about implementation are in serious question at this writing (more later).\\n\\u2022 Small cells are not new, not created for \\u201c5G\\u201d. There are traditionally three kinds.\\n\\u2022 From the outset: Opposition implies 5G is small cells/MMW. Typically careless statement given as example.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cThe skin\\u2019s sweat ducts act as receiving antennas for 5G\\u201d is speculative, based on a stretched interpretation of an Israeli study. Study details reviewed. Wording of its \\u201cwarning-flag\\u201d conclusion applies conceptually to all G\\u2019s. Harm was known decades before 2G (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\u2022 Insufficient correlation to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas. Making cases?\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G is a weapon\\u201d is based carelessly on the military\\u2019s ADS system that heats the skin. No correlation with commercial 5G mobile. MMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G.\\n\\u2022 2G began as a military weapon and was adapted to telecom. Entire wireless telecom system is a weapon.\\n\\u2022 All telecom/WiFi wireless frequencies, 2G-4G, will cook you at sufficiently high power levels. Telecom 5Gmmw at commercial levels will not.\\n\\u2022 A powerful Air Force radar system, Pave Paws, will cook you in a nanosecond at 450 MHz, so forget whine about \\u201c5G weapon.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 No ADS power range found, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study.\\n\\u2022 Power of microwave ovens and towers/phones compared. ADS configuration chosen to limit penetration depth.\\n\\u2022 No wattage output for 5G MLB or MMW antennas found, but did find Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of a 5Gmmw antenna for 28 and 38 GHz and compared with FCC standard.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G\\u201d per se opposition creates dangerous false sense of security encouraging continued use of pathological 3G/4G/WiFi wireless devices. Techno-humans adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G has not been safety tested\\u201d is a ploy. That the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d atrocities, whereas, the basic issue is wireless tech per se.\\n\\u2022 In 1996, FCC finally adopted ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992, covering frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range all MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019.\\n\\u2022 FCC assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is same fraud used to make assurances about 3G in 1996: \\u201cNo heat, no harm.\\u201d This author warned of this response to \\u201cStop 5G\\u201d in the 2/2019 article Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised?\\n\\u2022 Huge volume of science beginning in the 1950s brings up question whether *proper* testing was ever done.\\n\\u2022 FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science. This blatant criminality is clearly revealed by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 \\u201cCurrent FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d All official testing is fraud, can\\u2019t be \\u201coutdated.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 \\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing can exist.\\n\\u2022 More detail on the original testing cited two in sections of Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\u2022 Where infrastructure is concerned, emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA.\\u2019 But things seem to be developing differently. Even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\u2022 A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard covers two frequency ranges, FR1, FR2. One, for current bands below 6 GHz (3G/4G, i.e., 5Gmlb). Two, for 5Gmmw. WiFi remains separate for now\\n\\u2022 5G NR defines new protocols for MLB, providing at least 35% more 4G speed, while being called 5G without distinction. 5Gmlb can use same towers as 4G, has same range and penetration, but new antennas.\\n\\u2022 5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention, including \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and beamforming (more later).\\n\\u2022 Plans being made to market 5G in an unlicensed 3.5 GHz band of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service. MLB called 5G.\\n\\u2022 Apparently, current smartphones can be updated to process 5Gmlb; but 5Gmmw will require new (expensive) phones. Field tests: Samsung Galaxy S10 (good shot of 5Gmmw antenna/node in first article). Both advise \\u2018holding off\\u2019 on new, 5G phones.\\n\\u2022 Two possible motives behind \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria are addressed.\\n\\u2022 Two dissections of news stories causing 5G rollout confusion \\u2013 the UK\\u2019s 6/26/19 Glastonbury Festival and a notable 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland. Neither report clarifies which \\u201c5G\\u201d was involved.\\n\\u2022 Glastonbury protest article laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated hysteria that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Implied is that 2G-4G were not experiments. Paradox: They were and were not. Distinctions must be made.\\n\\u2022 Crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s.\\n\\u2022 Decision made long ago to put life/people at risk (see History of Official Awareness).Thus, thus the yes/no experiment is not IF harm, but when, and how the explosion will play out.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cGood\\u201d news: Human health collapse could be prevented \\u2013 by ecosystem collapse. Race is on.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s happening \\u2018on the ground.\\u2019 The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon.\\n\\u2022 Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. Verizon says this is MMW (5Gmmw). But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sacramento seems a most enthusiastic host. Website features Verizon UWB installation at citizen\\u2019s home, City officials attending. Sacramento also prides itself on attaining \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more below).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas \\u2013 could be its final destination.\\n\\u2022 Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason, with 3G/4G still operating. Again, the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\u2022 The forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. Drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for millions of closely spaced fixtures nationwide. There now seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\u2022 A report on new Qualcomm smartphone 5Gmmw antennas also covers antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\u2022 It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) is specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs say 4G can handle it. Probably 4Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 Some opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. The attempted deployment of smart utility meters on (4G) WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say.\\n\\u2022 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\u2022 I didn\\u2019t invest time trying to find where dense fixture locations are happening in neighborhoods. Rollout info suggests only populous areas. Readers who\\u2019ve seen this anywhere are asked to share in Comments.\\n\\u2022 If FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose.\\n\\u2022 Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams said in an interview that FLD is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d True, but not the whole truth. McAdam touted 5Gmmw for Smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality.\\n\\u2022 No matter the 5G version, wireless per se is the foundation for managing/controlling every aspect of daily life with \\u201cSmart\\u201d technology.\\n\\u2022 None of the above means things can\\u2019t change. MLB rollout could be precursor to an FLD/MMW invasion or satellite saturation in outlying areas. Speculation on MMW future and interface between ground and satellite purposes and services.\\n\\u2022 Parenthetical discussion of Sacramento-City web page showing total-surveillance/human-control system rapidly gestating under auspices of \\u201cSmart City for public safety/benefits\\u201d \\u2013 especially \\u201cProjects in Progress\\u201d. Note promise of \\u201cSTEM,\\u201d the nationwide programming for turning kids into corporate plug-ins.\\n\\u2022 STEM promises techno-shiny future, and exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. But the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum of the latter. Imagine the potential chaos once a Smart City become hackers target.\\n\\u2022 Mostly confusion in these reports, all implying 5Gmmw. No clear indication of which \\u201c5G\\u201d is involved in most cases \\u2013 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 People see new infrastructure and assume MMW.\\n\\u2022 All harms reported thus far are classic 2G-4G symptoms. Most are the \\u201cElectrohypersensitivity (EHS) type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\u2022 RF meters have been used to support claims of harm, but ordinary meters can\\u2019t read MMW. Such meters are professional, expensive, technical equipment.\\n\\u2022 A true 5G phone would ID MMW and MLB, but no meter shows frequencies, so even a pro one wouldn\\u2019t reveal which frequencies are present.\\n\\u2022 Long-term previous exposure plays into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Harm \\u201cverified\\u201d by ordinary meters proves 4G harm, one way or another.\\n\\u2022 One hawker claims its ordinary meter can read \\u201c5G,\\u201d a ruse brought to you by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 For most situations, meters not much use for most people \\u2013 no safe exposure level (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Meters sometimes useful for people using shielding, etc, but symptom improvement doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops..\\n\\u2022 Differences between MMW effects and long-reported classic 2G-4G effects can tentatively identify 5G frequency type.\\n\\u2022 MMW potentially threatens skin and eyes. A study irresponsibly (underhandedly?) cited in an article to prove \\u201c5G\\u201d has heart effects is exposed.\\n\\u2022 Study also implies that any microwave frequency at sufficient power can cook and kill you.\\n\\u2022 Possible, but still speculative, that 5Gmmw can cause MLB effects, because conductive body tissues can carry induced currents deep into the body.\\n\\u2022 MIMO (\\u2018my-mo\\u2019) antenna tech has been used for MLB for more than a decade. The new development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, or many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming beams of radiation.\\n\\u2022 One question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose a greater threat than traditional antennas. It\\u2019s possible. It seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of beams, although a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\u2022 Aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying beams avoids high power output per beam.\\n\\u2022 Hysteria often warns of an outrageously high increase in power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d For a few reasons, this seems unlikely.\\n\\u2022 Details of several typical news reports. Most demonstrate fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower will make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one, a general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\u2022 Story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from Verizon antenna installed near home illustrates confusion. Testimony before Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with mayor present.\\n\\u2022 Type of antenna not given, but probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\u2022 Strange that testimony date precedes stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests. Maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\u2022 Opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that mean? Incident suggests MMW effect, but still shows need to know what you mean when you say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although she commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but her suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness won\\u2019t be taken seriously.\\n\\u2022 Typically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\u2022 Even if new 5Gmlb antennas pose greater health risk, it\\u2019s academic, because the \\u2018pre-5G\\u2019 endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal.\\n\\u2022 Outrageous opposition-induced hysteria from Gateshead in UK about \\u201c5G\\u201d from street lights. Dangers of LED lights cited.\\n\\u2022 News report from Cincinnati shows folks in the dark about 5G, thanks to hysteria. Story from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, shows better awareness of wireless threat. Both show dangerous thinking about shutting down/moving tower (no one talking ecosystem).\\n\\u2022 An RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story, is cited as accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\u2022 Original 9/20/19 story (now includes update) a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria. No one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers previously. It\\u2019s a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that people fear will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d..\\n\\u2022 9/27/19 update shows interview with concerned nurse. \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacks understanding of wireless, will feel safer if that tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\u2022 Tall, new-look tower with cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video). Looks nothing like Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw antenna seen in phone report in the 5G Rollouts section.\\n\\u2022 Update also says it\\u2019s a Sprint tower, so can\\u2019t be MMW. \\u201c5G\\u201d fear an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s in cylindrical fixture and its specific functions are anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\u2022 Update also notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what?\\n\\u2022 3/12/19 San Joaquin report also concerns tall tower with cylindrical fixture \\u201ctoo close to school.\\u201d No 5G fear, more general awareness of wireless danger. \\u2018Cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\u2022 Three teachers and four students with various cancers since 2016 Also 22 year-old former male student. No mention of whether teachers and young man were exposed to any other towers/devices. Just that nasty tower\\u2026\\n\\u2022 Ripon case interesting for several reasons. Independent expert contradicted official assurance that tower tested OK. Shows common ignorance: \\u201c\\u2026kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sprint shut tower down, agreed to relocate. Good PR, suggests industry/towns will back down.\\n\\u2022 Two more reasons: First is overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure and probably cumulative effect (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Second reason, bogus advice \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the argument for slow death over quicker death, or futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can make things worse.\\n\\u2022 Any antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\u2022 Reducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usage tips and lower exposure limits. Both futile.\\n\\u2022 Reliance on power level to determine safety is largely a convenience, not science. Several other factors make determination too complex. They keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\u2022 Harm stories indicate people seem to think it just happened. Fatal error. Felt or not, effects can occur any time during or after exposure, so no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway.\\n\\u2022 An organization called EHS Idaho collects reports on incidence and effects in the Idaho population of electrohypersensitivity (EHS). Term misleading. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 suggested.\\n\\u2022 An estimated 35% of the Idaho population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. As bad as this is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad as things could quickly and easily get. Call this \\u201cpre-terminal disaster.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Illness caused by wireless radiation not new or unique to it, even though lists and categories of issues attributed to it.\\n\\u2022 Question: how much of today\\u2019s ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 all known prior to wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to wireless tech (or even the whole range of RF we \\u2019bathe\\u2019 in)?\\n\\u2022 If officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\u2022 For sick users \\u2014 much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\u2022 But quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\u2022 Manifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere.\\n\\u2022 If we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. I Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\u2022 One historical document acknowledging harm FCC denies is 1981 WHO report, Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973.\\n\\u2022 Very long report covers frequencies from 100 KHz to 300 GHz, but telecom/WiFi harm for last three decades has come from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\u2022 Quotes from document summary given, revealing ruthless deception. It\\u2019s all most people need to read. Section 1.1.6. admits safe level should be \\u201c\\u2026close to natural background levels\\u201d. Natural background microwave is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed).\\n\\nSo there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit after all: zero.\\n\\u2022 Safety \\u201cnot technically feasible.\\u201d Assumption that technology more important than environment and human health.\\n\\u2022 Notes and quotes from a presentation at 2009 Whole Health Expo reveal knowledge of harm since the 1950s. No indication in Summary if 1973 Warsaw Symposium or 1981 WHO reviewers were aware.\\n\\u2022 No indication in Summary that Symposium/WHO were aware of military microwave stealth-weapon research begun in 1950s. What eventually became 2G.\\n\\u2022 Worth repeating: The most dire threat is to ecosystem, not humans. No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\u2022 threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. One thing is certain about most technology, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\u2022 Threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about process of creating it..\\n\\u2022 From resource acquisition (especially mining) to disposal, technology is toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless covers the whole process.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cWired\\u201d systems will not stop this assault.\\n\\u2022 The attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed.\\n\\u2022 If one isn\\u2019t careful, one might conclude \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers think humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\u2022 Most hysteria focused on ground antennas, while well more than 50,000 new satellites are underway and proposed, a horrific threat.\\n\\u2022 Heavy pollution produced by each launch, as well as massive removal of atmospheric oxygen. dynamic graph linked.\\n\\u2022 Much still up in the air on satellites. Plan seems to be shoot them up first, answer proprietary questions later, dismissing anyone else\\u2019s.\\n\\u2022 In Europe there are calls for science papers on satellite/5G integration. There is an appeal to \\u2018stop 5G in space\\u2019, but popular emphasis remains disproportionately on ground installations.\\n\\u2022 Arrogant FCC has flatly dismissed legitimate concerns raised by NASA, NOAA and more. Does such arrogance suggest level of power beyond corporate/governmental?\\n\\u2022 Might such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates?\\n\\u2022 Best way to beat 5G on the ground is to reject all current wireless (3G/4G) at the commercial level. This could well impact satellites also.\\n\\u2022 Outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the ones on earthbound antennas.\\n\\u2022 Taking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\u2022 The race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse. Allowing classic 4G (or 5G FR1) to continue potentiates imminent disaster.\\n\\u2022 Experience shows that appeals, based on science, to governments at all levels; to national and international regulatory bodies, and so on is an exercise in futility.\\n\\u2022 It\\u2019s in the people\\u2019s hands. Give up wireless per se or give up the future \\u2013 liberty first, then life. If not, then welcome all 5G.

(majorly revised and updated). The full text is strongly encouraged; but two Summaries have been published for fast-trackers. This more detailed one, for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose, and a Text Summary for those who prefer a more general sweep. Both provide a means for seeing \\u201c5G\\u201d more clearly, and quickly accessing areas of particular interest.\\n\\nWhen you say, \\u201c5G\\u201d or \\u201dStop 5G,\\u201d please be sure you haven\\u2019t been misled about what it is, what you are opposing \\u2013 or want. Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts. This article attempts to raise some \\u2018dust\\u2019 and clear the air at the same time.\\n\\nBecause carrier rollouts and stories of harm are major opposition concerns, much detail is given to show how \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria makes things worse in various cases. Safety testing, history of official awareness of harm, and opposition priorities are also discussed.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Hysterical opposition to \\u201c5G\\u201d has created dangerous misconception, beginning with careless misuse of the very term \\u201c5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 When most people say \\u201c5G\\u201d they refer to its \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation, often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This is inaccurate, confusing and dangerous. EHF and 5G EHF are specified.\\n\\u2022 At least 4 Important distinctions must be kept in mind for understanding and discussing \\u201c5G,\\u201d especially one between the two 5G\\u2019s \\u2013 high frequency 5G and mid-band to low-band 5G.\\n\\u2022 Some terms are suggested to clear confusion and enhance discussion. \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d houses antennas. A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\u2022 Common, confusing warnings are discussed: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The term \\u201csmall cell\\u201d is misused, being applied to enclosures and/or fixtures instead of the area covered by antenna range. 5Gmmw has short range, thus its cell is small. \\u2018Making cases\\u2019.\\n\\u2022 MMW easily blocked, even by leaves and heavy rain, gets worse with increasing frequency requiring more fixture locations. Hysteria rarely notes that 5Gmlb is a large cell and is not blocked.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density. Common warnings about implementation are in serious question at this writing (more later).\\n\\u2022 Small cells are not new, not created for \\u201c5G\\u201d. There are traditionally three kinds.\\n\\u2022 From the outset: Opposition implies 5G is small cells/MMW. Typically careless statement given as example.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cThe skin\\u2019s sweat ducts act as receiving antennas for 5G\\u201d is speculative, based on a stretched interpretation of an Israeli study. Study details reviewed. Wording of its \\u201cwarning-flag\\u201d conclusion applies conceptually to all G\\u2019s. Harm was known decades before 2G (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\u2022 Insufficient correlation to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas. Making cases?\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G is a weapon\\u201d is based carelessly on the military\\u2019s ADS system that heats the skin. No correlation with commercial 5G mobile. MMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G.\\n\\u2022 2G began as a military weapon and was adapted to telecom. Entire wireless telecom system is a weapon.\\n\\u2022 All telecom/WiFi wireless frequencies, 2G-4G, will cook you at sufficiently high power levels. Telecom 5Gmmw at commercial levels will not.\\n\\u2022 A powerful Air Force radar system, Pave Paws, will cook you in a nanosecond at 450 MHz, so forget whine about \\u201c5G weapon.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 No ADS power range found, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study.\\n\\u2022 Power of microwave ovens and towers/phones compared. ADS configuration chosen to limit penetration depth.\\n\\u2022 No wattage output for 5G MLB or MMW antennas found, but did find Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of a 5Gmmw antenna for 28 and 38 GHz and compared with FCC standard.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G\\u201d per se opposition creates dangerous false sense of security encouraging continued use of pathological 3G/4G/WiFi wireless devices. Techno-humans adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G has not been safety tested\\u201d is a ploy. That the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d atrocities, whereas, the basic issue is wireless tech per se.\\n\\u2022 In 1996, FCC finally adopted ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992, covering frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range all MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019.\\n\\u2022 FCC assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is same fraud used to make assurances about 3G in 1996: \\u201cNo heat, no harm.\\u201d This author warned of this response to \\u201cStop 5G\\u201d in the 2/2019 article Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised?\\n\\u2022 Huge volume of science beginning in the 1950s brings up question whether *proper* testing was ever done.\\n\\u2022 FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science. This blatant criminality is clearly revealed by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 \\u201cCurrent FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d All official testing is fraud, can\\u2019t be \\u201coutdated.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 \\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing can exist.\\n\\u2022 More detail on the original testing cited two in sections of Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\u2022 Where infrastructure is concerned, emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA.\\u2019 But things seem to be developing differently. Even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\u2022 A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard covers two frequency ranges, FR1, FR2. One, for current bands below 6 GHz (3G/4G, i.e., 5Gmlb). Two, for 5Gmmw. WiFi remains separate for now\\n\\u2022 5G NR defines new protocols for MLB, providing at least 35% more 4G speed, while being called 5G without distinction. 5Gmlb can use same towers as 4G, has same range and penetration, but new antennas.\\n\\u2022 5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention, including \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and beamforming (more later).\\n\\u2022 Plans being made to market 5G in an unlicensed 3.5 GHz band of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service. MLB called 5G.\\n\\u2022 Apparently, current smartphones can be updated to process 5Gmlb; but 5Gmmw will require new (expensive) phones. Field tests: Samsung Galaxy S10 (good shot of 5Gmmw antenna/node in first article). Both advise \\u2018holding off\\u2019 on new, 5G phones.\\n\\u2022 Two possible motives behind \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria are addressed.\\n\\u2022 Two dissections of news stories causing 5G rollout confusion \\u2013 the UK\\u2019s 6/26/19 Glastonbury Festival and a notable 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland. Neither report clarifies which \\u201c5G\\u201d was involved.\\n\\u2022 Glastonbury protest article laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated hysteria that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Implied is that 2G-4G were not experiments. Paradox: They were and were not. Distinctions must be made.\\n\\u2022 Crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s.\\n\\u2022 Decision made long ago to put life/people at risk (see History of Official Awareness).Thus, thus the yes/no experiment is not IF harm, but when, and how the explosion will play out.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cGood\\u201d news: Human health collapse could be prevented \\u2013 by ecosystem collapse. Race is on.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s happening \\u2018on the ground.\\u2019 The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon.\\n\\u2022 Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. Verizon says this is MMW (5Gmmw). But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sacramento seems a most enthusiastic host. Website features Verizon UWB installation at citizen\\u2019s home, City officials attending. Sacramento also prides itself on attaining \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more below).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas \\u2013 could be its final destination.\\n\\u2022 Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason, with 3G/4G still operating. Again, the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\u2022 The forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. Drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for millions of closely spaced fixtures nationwide. There now seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\u2022 A report on new Qualcomm smartphone 5Gmmw antennas also covers antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\u2022 It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) is specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs say 4G can handle it. Probably 4Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 Some opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. The attempted deployment of smart utility meters on (4G) WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say.\\n\\u2022 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\u2022 I didn\\u2019t invest time trying to find where dense fixture locations are happening in neighborhoods. Rollout info suggests only populous areas. Readers who\\u2019ve seen this anywhere are asked to share in Comments.\\n\\u2022 If FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose.\\n\\u2022 Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams said in an interview that FLD is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d True, but not the whole truth. McAdam touted 5Gmmw for Smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality.\\n\\u2022 No matter the 5G version, wireless per se is the foundation for managing/controlling every aspect of daily life with \\u201cSmart\\u201d technology.\\n\\u2022 None of the above means things can\\u2019t change. MLB rollout could be precursor to an FLD/MMW invasion or satellite saturation in outlying areas. Speculation on MMW future and interface between ground and satellite purposes and services.\\n\\u2022 Parenthetical discussion of Sacramento-City web page showing total-surveillance/human-control system rapidly gestating under auspices of \\u201cSmart City for public safety/benefits\\u201d \\u2013 especially \\u201cProjects in Progress\\u201d. Note promise of \\u201cSTEM,\\u201d the nationwide programming for turning kids into corporate plug-ins.\\n\\u2022 STEM promises techno-shiny future, and exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. But the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum of the latter. Imagine the potential chaos once a Smart City become hackers target.\\n\\u2022 Mostly confusion in these reports, all implying 5Gmmw. No clear indication of which \\u201c5G\\u201d is involved in most cases \\u2013 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 People see new infrastructure and assume MMW.\\n\\u2022 All harms reported thus far are classic 2G-4G symptoms. Most are the \\u201cElectrohypersensitivity (EHS) type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\u2022 RF meters have been used to support claims of harm, but ordinary meters can\\u2019t read MMW. Such meters are professional, expensive, technical equipment.\\n\\u2022 A true 5G phone would ID MMW and MLB, but no meter shows frequencies, so even a pro one wouldn\\u2019t reveal which frequencies are present.\\n\\u2022 Long-term previous exposure plays into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Harm \\u201cverified\\u201d by ordinary meters proves 4G harm, one way or another.\\n\\u2022 One hawker claims its ordinary meter can read \\u201c5G,\\u201d a ruse brought to you by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 For most situations, meters not much use for most people \\u2013 no safe exposure level (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Meters sometimes useful for people using shielding, etc, but symptom improvement doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops..\\n\\u2022 Differences between MMW effects and long-reported classic 2G-4G effects can tentatively identify 5G frequency type.\\n\\u2022 MMW potentially threatens skin and eyes. A study irresponsibly (underhandedly?) cited in an article to prove \\u201c5G\\u201d has heart effects is exposed.\\n\\u2022 Study also implies that any microwave frequency at sufficient power can cook and kill you.\\n\\u2022 Possible, but still speculative, that 5Gmmw can cause MLB effects, because conductive body tissues can carry induced currents deep into the body.\\n\\u2022 MIMO (\\u2018my-mo\\u2019) antenna tech has been used for MLB for more than a decade. The new development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, or many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming beams of radiation.\\n\\u2022 One question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose a greater threat than traditional antennas. It\\u2019s possible. It seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of beams, although a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\u2022 Aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying beams avoids high power output per beam.\\n\\u2022 Hysteria often warns of an outrageously high increase in power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d For a few reasons, this seems unlikely.\\n\\u2022 Details of several typical news reports. Most demonstrate fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower will make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one, a general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\u2022 Story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from Verizon antenna installed near home illustrates confusion. Testimony before Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with mayor present.\\n\\u2022 Type of antenna not given, but probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\u2022 Strange that testimony date precedes stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests. Maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\u2022 Opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that mean? Incident suggests MMW effect, but still shows need to know what you mean when you say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although she commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but her suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness won\\u2019t be taken seriously.\\n\\u2022 Typically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\u2022 Even if new 5Gmlb antennas pose greater health risk, it\\u2019s academic, because the \\u2018pre-5G\\u2019 endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal.\\n\\u2022 Outrageous opposition-induced hysteria from Gateshead in UK about \\u201c5G\\u201d from street lights. Dangers of LED lights cited.\\n\\u2022 News report from Cincinnati shows folks in the dark about 5G, thanks to hysteria. Story from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, shows better awareness of wireless threat. Both show dangerous thinking about shutting down/moving tower (no one talking ecosystem).\\n\\u2022 An RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story, is cited as accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\u2022 Original 9/20/19 story (now includes update) a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria. No one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers previously. It\\u2019s a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that people fear will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d..\\n\\u2022 9/27/19 update shows interview with concerned nurse. \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacks understanding of wireless, will feel safer if that tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\u2022 Tall, new-look tower with cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video). Looks nothing like Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw antenna seen in phone report in the 5G Rollouts section.\\n\\u2022 Update also says it\\u2019s a Sprint tower, so can\\u2019t be MMW. \\u201c5G\\u201d fear an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s in cylindrical fixture and its specific functions are anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\u2022 Update also notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what?\\n\\u2022 3/12/19 San Joaquin report also concerns tall tower with cylindrical fixture \\u201ctoo close to school.\\u201d No 5G fear, more general awareness of wireless danger. \\u2018Cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\u2022 Three teachers and four students with various cancers since 2016 Also 22 year-old former male student. No mention of whether teachers and young man were exposed to any other towers/devices. Just that nasty tower\\u2026\\n\\u2022 Ripon case interesting for several reasons. Independent expert contradicted official assurance that tower tested OK. Shows common ignorance: \\u201c\\u2026kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sprint shut tower down, agreed to relocate. Good PR, suggests industry/towns will back down.\\n\\u2022 Two more reasons: First is overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure and probably cumulative effect (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Second reason, bogus advice \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the argument for slow death over quicker death, or futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can make things worse.\\n\\u2022 Any antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\u2022 Reducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usage tips and lower exposure limits. Both futile.\\n\\u2022 Reliance on power level to determine safety is largely a convenience, not science. Several other factors make determination too complex. They keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\u2022 Harm stories indicate people seem to think it just happened. Fatal error. Felt or not, effects can occur any time during or after exposure, so no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway.\\n\\u2022 An organization called EHS Idaho collects reports on incidence and effects in the Idaho population of electrohypersensitivity (EHS). Term misleading. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 suggested.\\n\\u2022 An estimated 35% of the Idaho population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. As bad as this is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad as things could quickly and easily get. Call this \\u201cpre-terminal disaster.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Illness caused by wireless radiation not new or unique to it, even though lists and categories of issues attributed to it.\\n\\u2022 Question: how much of today\\u2019s ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 all known prior to wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to wireless tech (or even the whole range of RF we \\u2019bathe\\u2019 in)?\\n\\u2022 If officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\u2022 For sick users \\u2014 much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\u2022 But quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\u2022 Manifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere.\\n\\u2022 If we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. I Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\u2022 One historical document acknowledging harm FCC denies is 1981 WHO report, Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973.\\n\\u2022 Very long report covers frequencies from 100 KHz to 300 GHz, but telecom/WiFi harm for last three decades has come from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\u2022 Quotes from document summary given, revealing ruthless deception. It\\u2019s all most people need to read. Section 1.1.6. admits safe level should be \\u201c\\u2026close to natural background levels\\u201d. Natural background microwave is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed).\\n\\nSo there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit after all: zero.\\n\\u2022 Safety \\u201cnot technically feasible.\\u201d Assumption that technology more important than environment and human health.\\n\\u2022 Notes and quotes from a presentation at 2009 Whole Health Expo reveal knowledge of harm since the 1950s. No indication in Summary if 1973 Warsaw Symposium or 1981 WHO reviewers were aware.\\n\\u2022 No indication in Summary that Symposium/WHO were aware of military microwave stealth-weapon research begun in 1950s. What eventually became 2G.\\n\\u2022 Worth repeating: The most dire threat is to ecosystem, not humans. No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\u2022 threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. One thing is certain about most technology, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\u2022 Threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about process of creating it..\\n\\u2022 From resource acquisition (especially mining) to disposal, technology is toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless covers the whole process.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cWired\\u201d systems will not stop this assault.\\n\\u2022 The attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed.\\n\\u2022 If one isn\\u2019t careful, one might conclude \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers think humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\u2022 Most hysteria focused on ground antennas, while well more than 50,000 new satellites are underway and proposed, a horrific threat.\\n\\u2022 Heavy pollution produced by each launch, as well as massive removal of atmospheric oxygen. dynamic graph linked.\\n\\u2022 Much still up in the air on satellites. Plan seems to be shoot them up first, answer proprietary questions later, dismissing anyone else\\u2019s.\\n\\u2022 In Europe there are calls for science papers on satellite/5G integration. There is an appeal to \\u2018stop 5G in space\\u2019, but popular emphasis remains disproportionately on ground installations.\\n\\u2022 Arrogant FCC has flatly dismissed legitimate concerns raised by NASA, NOAA and more. Does such arrogance suggest level of power beyond corporate/governmental?\\n\\u2022 Might such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates?\\n\\u2022 Best way to beat 5G on the ground is to reject all current wireless (3G/4G) at the commercial level. This could well impact satellites also.\\n\\u2022 Outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the ones on earthbound antennas.\\n\\u2022 Taking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\u2022 The race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse. Allowing classic 4G (or 5G FR1) to continue potentiates imminent disaster.\\n\\u2022 Experience shows that appeals, based on science, to governments at all levels; to national and international regulatory bodies, and so on is an exercise in futility.\\n\\u2022 It\\u2019s in the people\\u2019s hands.

(majorly revised and updated). The full text is strongly encouraged; but two Summaries have been published for fast-trackers. This more detailed one, for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose, and a Text Summary for those who prefer a more general sweep. Both provide a means for seeing \\u201c5G\\u201d more clearly, and quickly accessing areas of particular interest.\\n\\nWhen you say, \\u201c5G\\u201d or \\u201dStop 5G,\\u201d please be sure you haven\\u2019t been misled about what it is, what you are opposing \\u2013 or want. Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts. This article attempts to raise some \\u2018dust\\u2019 and clear the air at the same time.\\n\\nBecause carrier rollouts and stories of harm are major opposition concerns, much detail is given to show how \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria makes things worse in various cases. Safety testing, history of official awareness of harm, and opposition priorities are also discussed.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Hysterical opposition to \\u201c5G\\u201d has created dangerous misconception, beginning with careless misuse of the very term \\u201c5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 When most people say \\u201c5G\\u201d they refer to its \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation, often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This is inaccurate, confusing and dangerous. EHF and 5G EHF are specified.\\n\\u2022 At least 4 Important distinctions must be kept in mind for understanding and discussing \\u201c5G,\\u201d especially one between the two 5G\\u2019s \\u2013 high frequency 5G and mid-band to low-band 5G.\\n\\u2022 Some terms are suggested to clear confusion and enhance discussion. \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d houses antennas. A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\u2022 Common, confusing warnings are discussed: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 The term \\u201csmall cell\\u201d is misused, being applied to enclosures and/or fixtures instead of the area covered by antenna range. 5Gmmw has short range, thus its cell is small. \\u2018Making cases\\u2019.\\n\\u2022 MMW easily blocked, even by leaves and heavy rain, gets worse with increasing frequency requiring more fixture locations. Hysteria rarely notes that 5Gmlb is a large cell and is not blocked.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density. Common warnings about implementation are in serious question at this writing (more later).\\n\\u2022 Small cells are not new, not created for \\u201c5G\\u201d. There are traditionally three kinds.\\n\\u2022 From the outset: Opposition implies 5G is small cells/MMW. Typically careless statement given as example.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cThe skin\\u2019s sweat ducts act as receiving antennas for 5G\\u201d is speculative, based on a stretched interpretation of an Israeli study. Study details reviewed. Wording of its \\u201cwarning-flag\\u201d conclusion applies conceptually to all G\\u2019s. Harm was known decades before 2G (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\u2022 Insufficient correlation to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas. Making cases?\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G is a weapon\\u201d is based carelessly on the military\\u2019s ADS system that heats the skin. No correlation with commercial 5G mobile. MMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G.\\n\\u2022 2G began as a military weapon and was adapted to telecom. Entire wireless telecom system is a weapon.\\n\\u2022 All telecom/WiFi wireless frequencies, 2G-4G, will cook you at sufficiently high power levels. Telecom 5Gmmw at commercial levels will not.\\n\\u2022 A powerful Air Force radar system, Pave Paws, will cook you in a nanosecond at 450 MHz, so forget whine about \\u201c5G weapon.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 No ADS power range found, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study.\\n\\u2022 Power of microwave ovens and towers/phones compared. ADS configuration chosen to limit penetration depth.\\n\\u2022 No wattage output for 5G MLB or MMW antennas found, but did find Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of a 5Gmmw antenna for 28 and 38 GHz and compared with FCC standard.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G\\u201d per se opposition creates dangerous false sense of security encouraging continued use of pathological 3G/4G/WiFi wireless devices. Techno-humans adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\u2022 \\u201c5G has not been safety tested\\u201d is a ploy. That the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d atrocities, whereas, the basic issue is wireless tech per se.\\n\\u2022 In 1996, FCC finally adopted ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992, covering frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range all MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019.\\n\\u2022 FCC assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is same fraud used to make assurances about 3G in 1996: \\u201cNo heat, no harm.\\u201d This author warned of this response to \\u201cStop 5G\\u201d in the 2/2019 article Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised?\\n\\u2022 Huge volume of science beginning in the 1950s brings up question whether *proper* testing was ever done.\\n\\u2022 FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science. This blatant criminality is clearly revealed by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 \\u201cCurrent FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d All official testing is fraud, can\\u2019t be \\u201coutdated.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 \\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing can exist.\\n\\u2022 More detail on the original testing cited two in sections of Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\u2022 Where infrastructure is concerned, emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA.\\u2019 But things seem to be developing differently. Even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\u2022 A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard covers two frequency ranges, FR1, FR2. One, for current bands below 6 GHz (3G/4G, i.e., 5Gmlb). Two, for 5Gmmw. WiFi remains separate for now\\n\\u2022 5G NR defines new protocols for MLB, providing at least 35% more 4G speed, while being called 5G without distinction. 5Gmlb can use same towers as 4G, has same range and penetration, but new antennas.\\n\\u2022 5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention, including \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and beamforming (more later).\\n\\u2022 Plans being made to market 5G in an unlicensed 3.5 GHz band of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service. MLB called 5G.\\n\\u2022 Apparently, current smartphones can be updated to process 5Gmlb; but 5Gmmw will require new (expensive) phones. Field tests: Samsung Galaxy S10 (good shot of 5Gmmw antenna/node in first article). Both advise \\u2018holding off\\u2019 on new, 5G phones.\\n\\u2022 Two possible motives behind \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria are addressed.\\n\\u2022 Two dissections of news stories causing 5G rollout confusion \\u2013 the UK\\u2019s 6/26/19 Glastonbury Festival and a notable 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland. Neither report clarifies which \\u201c5G\\u201d was involved.\\n\\u2022 Glastonbury protest article laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated hysteria that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Implied is that 2G-4G were not experiments. Paradox: They were and were not. Distinctions must be made.\\n\\u2022 Crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s.\\n\\u2022 Decision made long ago to put life/people at risk (see History of Official Awareness).Thus, thus the yes/no experiment is not IF harm, but when, and how the explosion will play out.\\n\\u2022 \\u201cGood\\u201d news: Human health collapse could be prevented \\u2013 by ecosystem collapse. Race is on.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s happening \\u2018on the ground.\\u2019 The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon.\\n\\u2022 Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. Verizon says this is MMW (5Gmmw). But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sacramento seems a most enthusiastic host. Website features Verizon UWB installation at citizen\\u2019s home, City officials attending. Sacramento also prides itself on attaining \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more below).\\n\\u2022 Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas \\u2013 could be its final destination.\\n\\u2022 Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason, with 3G/4G still operating. Again, the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\u2022 The forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. Drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for millions of closely spaced fixtures nationwide. There now seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\u2022 A report on new Qualcomm smartphone 5Gmmw antennas also covers antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\u2022 It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) is specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs say 4G can handle it. Probably 4Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 Some opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. The attempted deployment of smart utility meters on (4G) WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say.\\n\\u2022 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\u2022 I didn\\u2019t invest time trying to find where dense fixture locations are happening in neighborhoods. Rollout info suggests only populous areas. Readers who\\u2019ve seen this anywhere are asked to share in Comments.\\n\\u2022 If FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose.\\n\\u2022 Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams said in an interview that FLD is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d True, but not the whole truth. McAdam touted 5Gmmw for Smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality.\\n\\u2022 No matter the 5G version, wireless per se is the foundation for managing/controlling every aspect of daily life with \\u201cSmart\\u201d technology.\\n\\u2022 None of the above means things can\\u2019t change. MLB rollout could be precursor to an FLD/MMW invasion or satellite saturation in outlying areas. Speculation on MMW future and interface between ground and satellite purposes and services.\\n\\u2022 Parenthetical discussion of Sacramento-City web page showing total-surveillance/human-control system rapidly gestating under auspices of \\u201cSmart City for public safety/benefits\\u201d \\u2013 especially \\u201cProjects in Progress\\u201d. Note promise of \\u201cSTEM,\\u201d the nationwide programming for turning kids into corporate plug-ins.\\n\\u2022 STEM promises techno-shiny future, and exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. But the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum of the latter. Imagine the potential chaos once a Smart City become hackers target.\\n\\u2022 Mostly confusion in these reports, all implying 5Gmmw. No clear indication of which \\u201c5G\\u201d is involved in most cases \\u2013 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb.\\n\\u2022 People see new infrastructure and assume MMW.\\n\\u2022 All harms reported thus far are classic 2G-4G symptoms. Most are the \\u201cElectrohypersensitivity (EHS) type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\u2022 RF meters have been used to support claims of harm, but ordinary meters can\\u2019t read MMW. Such meters are professional, expensive, technical equipment.\\n\\u2022 A true 5G phone would ID MMW and MLB, but no meter shows frequencies, so even a pro one wouldn\\u2019t reveal which frequencies are present.\\n\\u2022 Long-term previous exposure plays into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Harm \\u201cverified\\u201d by ordinary meters proves 4G harm, one way or another.\\n\\u2022 One hawker claims its ordinary meter can read \\u201c5G,\\u201d a ruse brought to you by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 For most situations, meters not much use for most people \\u2013 no safe exposure level (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Meters sometimes useful for people using shielding, etc, but symptom improvement doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops..\\n\\u2022 Differences between MMW effects and long-reported classic 2G-4G effects can tentatively identify 5G frequency type.\\n\\u2022 MMW potentially threatens skin and eyes. A study irresponsibly (underhandedly?) cited in an article to prove \\u201c5G\\u201d has heart effects is exposed.\\n\\u2022 Study also implies that any microwave frequency at sufficient power can cook and kill you.\\n\\u2022 Possible, but still speculative, that 5Gmmw can cause MLB effects, because conductive body tissues can carry induced currents deep into the body.\\n\\u2022 MIMO (\\u2018my-mo\\u2019) antenna tech has been used for MLB for more than a decade. The new development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, or many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming beams of radiation.\\n\\u2022 One question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose a greater threat than traditional antennas. It\\u2019s possible. It seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of beams, although a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\u2022 Aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying beams avoids high power output per beam.\\n\\u2022 Hysteria often warns of an outrageously high increase in power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d For a few reasons, this seems unlikely.\\n\\u2022 Details of several typical news reports. Most demonstrate fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower will make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one, a general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\u2022 Story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from Verizon antenna installed near home illustrates confusion. Testimony before Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with mayor present.\\n\\u2022 Type of antenna not given, but probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\u2022 Strange that testimony date precedes stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests. Maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\u2022 Opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that mean? Incident suggests MMW effect, but still shows need to know what you mean when you say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\u2022 Mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although she commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but her suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness won\\u2019t be taken seriously.\\n\\u2022 Typically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\u2022 Even if new 5Gmlb antennas pose greater health risk, it\\u2019s academic, because the \\u2018pre-5G\\u2019 endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal.\\n\\u2022 Outrageous opposition-induced hysteria from Gateshead in UK about \\u201c5G\\u201d from street lights. Dangers of LED lights cited.\\n\\u2022 News report from Cincinnati shows folks in the dark about 5G, thanks to hysteria. Story from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, shows better awareness of wireless threat. Both show dangerous thinking about shutting down/moving tower (no one talking ecosystem).\\n\\u2022 An RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story, is cited as accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\u2022 Original 9/20/19 story (now includes update) a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria. No one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers previously. It\\u2019s a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that people fear will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d..\\n\\u2022 9/27/19 update shows interview with concerned nurse. \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacks understanding of wireless, will feel safer if that tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\u2022 Tall, new-look tower with cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video). Looks nothing like Verizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw antenna seen in phone report in the 5G Rollouts section.\\n\\u2022 Update also says it\\u2019s a Sprint tower, so can\\u2019t be MMW. \\u201c5G\\u201d fear an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\u2022 What\\u2019s in cylindrical fixture and its specific functions are anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\u2022 Update also notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what?\\n\\u2022 3/12/19 San Joaquin report also concerns tall tower with cylindrical fixture \\u201ctoo close to school.\\u201d No 5G fear, more general awareness of wireless danger. \\u2018Cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\u2022 Three teachers and four students with various cancers since 2016 Also 22 year-old former male student. No mention of whether teachers and young man were exposed to any other towers/devices. Just that nasty tower\\u2026\\n\\u2022 Ripon case interesting for several reasons. Independent expert contradicted official assurance that tower tested OK. Shows common ignorance: \\u201c\\u2026kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Sprint shut tower down, agreed to relocate. Good PR, suggests industry/towns will back down.\\n\\u2022 Two more reasons: First is overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure and probably cumulative effect (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\u2022 Second reason, bogus advice \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the argument for slow death over quicker death, or futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can make things worse.\\n\\u2022 Any antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\u2022 Reducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usage tips and lower exposure limits. Both futile.\\n\\u2022 Reliance on power level to determine safety is largely a convenience, not science. Several other factors make determination too complex. They keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\u2022 Harm stories indicate people seem to think it just happened. Fatal error. Felt or not, effects can occur any time during or after exposure, so no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway.\\n\\u2022 An organization called EHS Idaho collects reports on incidence and effects in the Idaho population of electrohypersensitivity (EHS). Term misleading. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 suggested.\\n\\u2022 An estimated 35% of the Idaho population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. As bad as this is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad as things could quickly and easily get. Call this \\u201cpre-terminal disaster.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Illness caused by wireless radiation not new or unique to it, even though lists and categories of issues attributed to it.\\n\\u2022 Question: how much of today\\u2019s ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 all known prior to wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to wireless tech (or even the whole range of RF we \\u2019bathe\\u2019 in)?\\n\\u2022 If officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\u2022 For sick users \\u2014 much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\u2022 But quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\u2022 Manifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere.\\n\\u2022 If we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. I Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\u2022 One historical document acknowledging harm FCC denies is 1981 WHO report, Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973.\\n\\u2022 Very long report covers frequencies from 100 KHz to 300 GHz, but telecom/WiFi harm for last three decades has come from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\u2022 Quotes from document summary given, revealing ruthless deception. It\\u2019s all most people need to read. Section 1.1.6. admits safe level should be \\u201c\\u2026close to natural background levels\\u201d.

There is an appeal to \\u2018stop 5G in space\\u2019, but popular emphasis remains disproportionately on ground installations.\\n\\u2022 Arrogant FCC has flatly dismissed legitimate concerns raised by NASA, NOAA and more. Does such arrogance suggest level of power beyond corporate/governmental?\\n\\u2022 Might such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates?\\n\\u2022 Best way to beat 5G on the ground is to reject all current wireless (3G/4G) at the commercial level.

Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more like hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts. This article attempts to raise some \\u2018dust\\u2019 and clear the air at the same time.\\n\\nBecause carrier rollouts and stories of harm are major opposition concerns, much detail is given to show how \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria makes things worse in various cases. Safety testing, history of official awareness of harm, and opposition priorities are also discussed.\\n\\nTwo Summaries have been published separately for fast-trackers. A Bullet Summary for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose detail, and a Text Summary, for those who want a more general sweep. Both provide means for quickly accessing areas of particular interest. But reading the full text is strongly encouraged. A small number of revisions might not appear in the Summaries.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\nWithout any help from \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers, the \\u201cnext generation\\u201d wireless is very dangerous \\u2014 all by itself \\u2014 as is each previous G by itself. But due to hysteria (illogic, inaccuracies and omissions), most opposition is also dangerous by itself.\\n\\nNot much has changed since this PC Mag article was published in 1/2019. And that doesn\\u2019t cover all critical aspects.\\n\\nConfusion begins right off the bat with the term \\u201c5G.\\u201d It\\u2019s being flung carelessly about, in articles, protests, news reports, corporate bulletins, by politicians \\u2013 even by scientists, and in submissions and comments to official bodies.\\n\\nAlmost always implied when \\u201c5G\\u201d is uttered \\u2013 especially, \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d or \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d \\u2013 is use of the \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This causes misunderstanding and potential danger.\\n\\nOverall, EHF is specified as 30 GHz to 300 GHz, and wavelength 10 millimeters to 1mm respectively. Only a small portion of that range is used in high-frequency 5G operation, and is defined in the US by the FCC as 24 GHz to 90 GHz.\\n\\nAs explained below in 5G Rollouts, for accuracy one must at least distinguish between 1) \\u2018small-cell\\u2019 infrastructure and 5G/small cells per se; 2) between 5G infrastructure and 5G high-frequency radiation; 3) between antennas and their enclosures, and **4) between high frequency 5G and mid-/low-band 5G, the signaling long used for 2G-4G iterations.\\n\\nNew terms are offered here for consistency and for clarifying hysteria-induced misunderstanding and confusion: \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d is a housing for antennas (sending/receiving elements). A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\nOne might see warnings such as: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSmall cell\\u201d is regularly misused, even by the Industry. Accurately speaking, a cell is not an antenna, but the effective area/range of an antenna\\u2019s radiation. 5Gmmw has a short range, which decreases with higher frequency. Thus, its cell is comparatively small.\\n\\nAlso, MMW can easily be blocked, even by even leaves and heavy rain, which deficiency increases with increasing frequency. Both drawbacks can be improved with a substantial power boost, but this also becomes a problem with energy cost and exposure levels, and so is not under consideration. Energy consumption is a major concern for the industry, which is feverishly at work to solve it.\\n\\nShort range and easy \\u2018blockability\\u2019 require more fixture locations, which hysteria frets about, rarely noting the distinction that 5Gmlb makes a large cell and is not blocked. Call it nitpicking if you will, but why not be accurate instead of creating misconception or \\u2018making cases\\u2019?\\n\\n\\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density, and common hysteria about how it will be implemented are in serious question (more later).\\n\\nOne interesting discovery came up while working on this article: Small cells are small but not new, and were not developed for 5G. Small cells have long been deployed in 3G and 4G networks and have become an industry choice to deliver MMW and enable better MLB performance if needed.\\n\\nTraditionally, there have been three types of small cells (more now), identified as they should be by antenna range. Some early deployments were in the US in 2007 and in the UK and Europe in 2009. \\u201cAccording to Small Cell Forum (who would have thought?), 18 million small cells had been deployed globally for various applications by the end of 2016.\\u201d\\n\\nBut haven\\u2019t we been led in a virtually deliberate way from the outset, and even continue to be, to think that 5G is small cells/MMW? Saying \\u201c5G\\u201d to indicate only these two things, or not specifying what you mean, is irresponsible, inaccurate, and misleading, as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nA 10/8/19 bulletin from Project Censored was forwarded to me via an email group that received it from Joel M. Moskowitz, PhD, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at UC Berkeley. A typically careless statement consisting of an error and a question mark says, \\u201cThe telecom industry is promoting the replacement of the current cellular network, known as 4G, with a new generation of higher frequency 5G wavelengths to power the \\u201cInternet of Things\\u2026\\u201d As a generalization, this is either shameful unawareness of the current scenario or untruth/propaganda, as we\\u2019ll also see.\\n\\n5G opposition also asserts that the skin\\u2019s (spiral) sweat ducts act as \\u201creceiving antennas.\\u201d This refers to an Israeli study, \\u201cThe human skin as a sub-THz receiver \\u2013 Does 5G pose a danger to it or not?\\u201d\\n\\nFrequency ranges don\\u2019t transition abruptly, but sub-THz usually means a range of 300 GHz down to 90, which is the upper end of FCC 5Gmmw.\\n\\nThe study Abstract uses two unquantified terms, \\u201csub-terahertz band\\u201d and \\u201csub-THz region.\\u201d I think \\u201cregion\\u201d is more accurate, meaning the range, or \\u201cspectrum\\u201d as understood in tech circles. \\u201cBand\\u201d is used to designate a single frequency, but also is an interval between a lower and upper frequency. For instance, a transmission between 40 and 50 MHz is a 10 MHz band (width).\\n\\nStudy frequencies were 75 GHz to 110 GHz. No wireless provider I\\u2019m aware of (in the US) has announced a mobile 5Gmmw service anywhere near 75 GHz. There was no explanation in the Abstract why announced commercial frequencies were not used.\\n\\nPower-level exposure limits at the user end are expressed in watts per area, usually square meter or square centimeter. No such levels are provided for the targets used, but maybe that\\u2019s not relevant in this case.\\n\\nThe highest commercial frequency I could find being tested is in the UK (though also approved for US), is 60 GHz. At least one rural test area is reportedly using a 60 GHz \\u201cwireless mesh\\u201d (interior network of interacting antennas) for \\u2018super WiFi.\\u2019 Not for mobile and still not up to 75 GHz.\\n\\nInteresting is that other UK rural testbeds are running unused TV bands called \\u201cTV white space\\u201d \\u2014 the old VHF to UHF frequencies, mostly MHz bands. This is 5G, mind you.\\n\\nHowever, bandwidths 71 to 76 GHz, 81 to 86 GHz and 92 to 95 GHz are available in the US for \\u201chigh-density\\u201d (high power) \\u201cfixed wireless access\\u201d services: \\u201c\\u2026the operation of wireless communication devices or systems used to connect two fixed locations (e.g., building to building or tower to building) with a radio or other wireless link\\u2026\\u201d, which would have to be line-of-sight and are not for mobile.\\n\\nAs noted, the higher the frequency, the greater are transmission challenges, so high-density bands would be very tight beams, with minimal to no obstacles and no human exposure (watch out, pigeons). Due to excess electricity consumption, MMW signals probably won\\u2019t be power boosted sufficiently to penetrate buildings, but be brought in via cable from an external receiver, then be distributed via a wireless network.\\n\\nStudy conclusion: \\u201cWe are raising a warning flag against the unrestricted use of sub-THz technologies for communication, before the possible consequences for public health are explored.\\u201d This seems sane enough \\u2013 within the insane context called wireless telecom/WiFi. See Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (needs updating).\\n\\nBut \\u201cunrestricted\\u201d at least suggests the impossible, that restrictions could prevent all trouble. Note also \\u201cpossible consequences.\\u201d This can\\u2019t be valid for harm in general, which is a fact long understood \\u2013 almost three decades before 2G came out (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\nWhen this warning is given, we don\\u2019t hear that the \\u201cwarning flag\\u201d would apply conceptually to all G\\u2019s; presumes there is a safe dose of MLB somewhere; and, as usual, neglects the ecosystem. But \\u2014 enough for protesters to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas? Making cases? I confess I fell for this one in my early research on wireless. A more likely, but still speculative, concern is discussed in Reports of \\u201c5G\\u201d Harm.\\n\\nAnother common warning, \\u201c5G is a weapon,\\u201d usually refers to the military\\u2019s Active Denial System, a \\u201cnon-lethal\\u201d microwave device for dispersing crowds by heating the skin. It\\u2019s a high density (power) millimeter wave at 95 GHz \\u2013 hardly commercial 5Gmmw.\\n\\nMMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G. Wireless telecom, beginning with 2G, is adapted stealth-weapon technology which uses very low power. The entire wireless system, not just \\u201c5G\\u201d, is a potential weapon on various levels (more below).\\n\\nAlso, high-enough density microwave \\u2014 at a \\u2018lowly\\u2019 2.5 GHz, for example \\u2014 will cook you like a microwave oven (2.45 GHz). That is, through and through, unlike ADS. At commercial power levels, 5Gmmw will not.\\n\\nA powerful Air Force radar system called Pave Paws at three US locations will cook you in a nanosecond at 420 to 450 MHz. Installations have two large circular arrays of antenna elements, each array radiating 580 kilowatts (!) It can detect a basketball at 12 miles, and small planes caught in the beam have blown up. So don\\u2019t swallow the rhetoric about telecom MMW weaponry.\\n\\nI was unable to find a range of ADS power output, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study calling out 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2) at 94 GHz (see Reports of Harm). ADS power is adjustable, however, enough to be used as a lethal weapon. But \\u2013 \\u2018making cases\\u2019 again?\\n\\nMicrowave ovens operate from 600 to 1200 watts. By comparison, maximum output of traditional cell towers is 10 watts \\u2013 phones, 2 watts. The higher frequency/shorter wavelength was chosen for ADS to limit penetration depth. Not saying that\\u2019s a good thing, not to mention it\\u2019s misleading (see Reports of Harm).\\n\\nFinding a wattage output figure for new, 5G MLB or MMW antennas proved fruitlessly time consuming (anyone?), but I did find a study establishing a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for a particular 5Gmmw antenna design for 28 and 38 GHz.\\n\\nSAR is an expression of how much radiation from a phone is absorbed over time by the body. It\\u2019s expressed in watts per kilogram (W/kg). Values were \\u201c\\u20260.37 and 1.34 W/kg [up to] 2 W/kg. Current FCC SAR standard is 1.6W/kg. This is given just for a sense of comparison, because SAR is useless for determining the amount of radiofrequency (RF) absorption in biosystems during typical conditions of use. See Safety Testing below.\\n\\nMany opposers suggest that 3G/4G/WiFi can be made reasonably safe. Others understand that impossibility, but seem too habituated and addicted to do the right thing. As noted in the Introduction, techno-humans are adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\n\\u201cNo \\u20185G\\u2019 safety studies have been conducted or funded by the Federal Communications Commission or the telecom industry, and none is planned.\\u201d Or simply, \\u201c5G has not been tested for safety\\u201d. Or the like. No such claims provide the facts.\\n\\nThat the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d terror, whereas, the real terror is wireless tech per se. Inherent in this ploy is the erroneous implication that 2G-4G were tested (a yes and no proposition).\\n\\nIn 1996, FCC adopted the standard identified as ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992. There were \\u2018window dressings\\u2019 in 2004, 2005, and 2010, and, like the original, covered frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019. (Overall \\u2018microwave\\u2019 is considered to be 300 MHz (.3 GHz) to 300 GHz.\\n\\nThe Commission\\u2019s assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is based on the fraudulent IEEE \\u2018testing\\u2019 it adopted in 1996 to run interference for 3G. That is, if the radiation doesn\\u2019t heat you, it can\\u2019t harm you.\\n\\nThis author warned of this response by FCC in February 2019 as \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria was powering up: Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised? Exposure limits worldwide are based on the ANSI/IEEE C95.1 fraud.\\n\\nPeer reviewed independent science, as early as the 1950s and still going, demonstrating myriad effects at non-heating levels, brings the integrity of C95.1-1992 through 2019 into question. Was *proper* testing ever done? Instead of clarifying this, hysteria makes the blanket claim. Making cases.\\n\\nThe FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science and such questions: \\u2018No convincing evidence exists, but we\\u2019re keeping an eye on it.\\u2019 The blatant criminality of the FCC with respect to wireless/EMF is clearly demonstrated by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nHysteria often resorts to another \\u2018ploy on words\\u2019 pertaining to 2G-4G, and used even by scientists, as seen near the end of this report: \\u201cThe current FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d The word implies that standards were at one time valid or sufficient, when they were never any such thing, for any living thing.\\n\\n\\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing has been demonstrated or can exist. Despite this, new limits are proposed and stubbornly called for \\u2014 in spite of the consensus that no safe level has even been published for fetuses.\\n\\nApparently, that\\u2019s not of sufficient concern to call for \\u201cStop Wireless Technology!\\u201d instead of \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d We\\u2019ll figure that fetus part out later.\\n\\nFor details on the original \\u2018safety\\u2019 testing \\u2013 scientific fraud, that is, on which power-level exposure limits worldwide are based \\u2013 see Sections Cell Phone Output and Exposure Limits for Users in the article Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\nMajor emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA,\\u2019 due to the short range and easy block-ability of MMW. But things seem to be developing differently for now, as we\\u2019ll see. As noted, even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\nThe following synthesis is the result of wading through too many articles to give credit to any one. Some sources tell varying stories about the same thing, and even disagree with each other considerably.\\n\\nSo here goes: A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard has been issued, specifying two frequency ranges: 5G NR bands FR1 & 5G NR bands FR2. Number one is for current bands below 6 GHz (5Gmlb), such as 600MHz, 1900MHz, and 2.5GHz; two is for MMW \\u2014 mostly 24 to 40 GHz for mobile, and higher for special applications (not mobile). In the near term, public WiFi will remain separate at MLB, 2.45 GHz and 5 GHz, but Verizon, for example, is offering 5Gmmw home internet/WiFi (not mobile) in limited areas of four cities.\\n\\n5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention at this point, including especially \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and \\u2018beamforming\\u2019 (more later).\\n\\nHowever, 5G NR FR1 can use the same towers as 4G, but will need new antennas. It has the same reach and penetration, but with shorter delay, while providing up to 35 percent more speed. The wireless addict\\u2019s dream. When you think about it, FR1 should really be 5G, and 5Gmmw, 6G.\\n\\nPlans are also in place for deployments using the unlicensed, Citizens Broadband Radio Service 3.5 GHz band, and all key players really want in. This is MLB called 5G, mind you.\\n\\nThings get a bit stickier when it comes to needing a new phone or not. Many current phones should be able to get updates to process FR1, but a new phone is needed for FR2. Generally, the \\u201ctech\\u201d advice is not to move yet, and here\\u2019s an example with Samsung\\u2019s $1300 5G Galaxy S10 being tested in Chicago (good shot of a 5Gmmw \\u201cnode\\u201d here).\\n\\nThe \\u201chold off\\u201d sentiment is conveyed also in this article. What it amounts to at this writing is that 5Gmmw is virtually at a \\u201cdemo\\u201d stage, not full coverage and service, even in town.\\n\\nMany \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers continue to use traditional 3G/4G/WiFi wireless, either knowing the danger or believing it\\u2019s safe, or will be, because they just want it. A possible motive driving hysteria?\\n\\nAnother possible motive for \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, or maybe just the effect it\\u2019s having, is to create a threat on the ground to draw resistance and to distract attention from the satellite program, a much more sinister development (see Examining Priorities below).\\n\\nThe disconnect about dangers brings up a story that drew wide attention at the time, especially in the UK, and one that seems to present a puzzle. It\\u2019s about the 6/26 2019 Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, Somerset County, England. It\\u2019s not strictly a \\u201crollout\\u201d story, more a system demo/test, but a decision was announced about installing \\u201c5G\\u201d network towers on festival grounds,\\n\\nDespite the fact that \\u201cGlastonbury officials [said] that move will allow festival attendees to access the Internet on their smartphones at faster speeds,\\u201d the announcement created a huge protest. In this story, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G are mentioned, but \\u201c5G\\u201d is not specified as MLB or MMW \\u2014 as anything, in other words. Is this hysteria-induced negligence?\\n\\nThe protest article is laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated one that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d. Even some much-admired professional associates/contacts promote this irresponsible notion. I must respectfully, but strongly, disagree, because the erroneous implication is that 2G-4G were/are not an experiment. Paradoxically, they were/are and were/are not experiments. Distinctions must be made (more below).\\n\\nConfusion again: \\u201cWhile obviously not many festival-goers are likely to have a \\u20185G\\u2019 phone by June, EE will be showing off what the network can do at its stand.\\u201d Once again, unspecified 5G. So, was the Glastonbury demo about 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb? Whatever, tickets sold out in less than 45 minutes.\\n\\nThe grand protest by potential attendees was both tragic and macabrely amusing: They were prepared to irradiate themselves constantly in huge numbers (up to 200,000 fans in attendance potentially using phones/smartphones), but fretted over \\u201c5G\\u201d, not even knowing it could have been their beloved 4G poison\\u2026reborn. Phone radiation is often overlooked.\\n\\nSimilarly, reports on the 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland clearly reflect the confusion and negligent use of \\u201c5G.\\u201d This Agence France-Presse story says, \\u201cBy early July, 334 antennae (sic) stations for 5G were operational across the country, authorities have told AFP.\\u201d Boy, watch out for authorities.\\n\\nAntenna location and density info aren\\u2019t revealed, but it could be urban or \\u2018near-urban.\\u2019 The number doesn\\u2019t seem to correspond to FLD in neighborhoods, but who knows, thanks to incomplete reporting (and perhaps misled authorities). The news reader is therefore in the dark about exactly what\\u2019s going on, but probably assumes it\\u2019s MMW. Due to\\u2026 \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s (but beginning much earlier). What was known then was later hushed in the runup to digital mobile telecom in 1991-2.\\n\\nThe decision was callously made long ago to put life/people at risk to have the technology (see History of Official Awareness below). Thus, the yes/no \\u201cexperiment\\u201d is not whether there will be harm from telecom/WiFi microwave, but the time window in which ongoing exposure damage \\u2014 across all frequencies and regardless of power level \\u2014 will manifest in a cascade of widespread intractable illness.\\n\\nNot to worry, though, that fate might be avoided: Ecosystem collapse could bring the house down beforehand. You might hear/see, \\u201cThe 5G race is on,\\u201d meaning market competition. The race of note, though, is between ecosystem collapse and human-health collapse.\\n\\nIn any case, here\\u2019s some of what\\u2019s happening in \\u2018real\\u2019 life. The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon. Carriers are choosing service areas for FR1, FR2 very carefully.\\n\\nT-Mobile has announced a nationwide 5Gmlb rollout at 600 MHz and an undisclosed application of \\u201c28 and 39\\u201d (see video), which means some 5Gmmw, almost certainly in cities.\\n\\nSprint\\u2019s plans are to run \\u201cLTE and 5G\\u201d simultaneously in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\nMentioned earlier, Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d (allegedly MMW \\u2013 5Gmmw) is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range to cover wide area\\u201d (5Gmlb), doesn\\u2019t say where.\\n\\nSacramento seems to be the most enthusiastic victim host for wireless. Here\\u2019s a gushing PR piece about a Verizon UWB installation at one Sacramento citizen\\u2019s home, with City officials attending. It features an external receiver. Sacramento also prides itself on opening the floodgates for \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more later).\\n\\nVerizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas, which could be its final destination. Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason. Ecocidal, terminally pathological 3G/4G still rages, again reflecting the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nThe forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. As noted earlier, drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for \\u201c18 million new\\u201d closely spaced fixtures nationwide. Given the above information on FR1 rollouts, there seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\nA report on new Qualcomm smartphone antennas supports the foregoing. It covers four bands between 26.5GHz and 40 GHz, but also antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 The QPM56xx RF module family works with the Snapdragon X50 modem to work in the sub-6GHz bands\\u2026\\u201d (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\nOne puzzle: It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) as specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs seem to disagree, saying 4G can handle IoT. Propaganda? Careless chatter? Who knows. It\\u2019s safe to assume, however, they refer to the new 4G/5Gmlb.\\n\\nSome opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. And the attempted widespread deployment of smart utility meters on 4G WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say. 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, because if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\nI didn\\u2019t bother spending the rest of my life trying to find if/where FLD installations are occurring. Anyone who\\u2019s seen close installations in any area, please share details in Comments.\\n\\nNow, if FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose. One, possibility of course, is optimized 5Gmlb performance, as in the past, although this shouldn\\u2019t often be necessary, due to the large cell and penetration of MLB.\\n\\nIn the entrained, FLD frame of mind, I was suspicious in Wireless Technology: \\u2026 (The 5G Locomotive section) of Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams\\u2019 statement in a 5/15/18 CNBC interview that antennas in your face is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019d say he was being coy, implying MLB, and being careful not to depict 5G accurately, since 5Gmmw must have increased FLD, while 5Gmlb, not for the most part.\\n\\nMcAdam touted 5Gmmw for smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality, all good reasons for planetary and health destruction. But remember, all the \\u201cSmart\\u201d out there now is WiFi, for which there is no 5Gmmw (although Verizon\\u2019s UWB Home Internet might qualify). \\u201cSmart\\u201d is the wireless tech word for monumentally stupid \\u2014 and for total surveillance and centralized coordination and control of daily life. See section The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026.\\n\\nNone of the above means things can\\u2019t change. It\\u2019s early. The MLB rollout could be just a prelude to an FLD/MMW invasion. If MMW gets a toe-hold and no one\\u2019s coming up provably sick, and people like it, it could weaken opposition and open floodgates.\\n\\nAnd there\\u2019s the question of how the many thousands of planned satellites (looking now like well more than 50,000) fit into the overall picture. Obviously, coverage comes immediately to mind, such as saturation in outlying areas? For IoT? One issue for satellites, though, is increased delay time (\\u201clatency\\u201d) due to distance. There could be a \\u2018division of labor\\u2019 among various services, such as ground for mobile and sats for entertainment.\\n\\nNote the promise of the nationwide sySTEMic programming to make kids into corporate plug-ins or hitech drones: \\u201cSTEM education emphasizes the value of a rigorous, interdisciplinary approach to education, allowing students to compete and succeed in a modern global marketplace.\\u201d How many dubious assumptions, claims and buzzwords in that PR flak?\\n\\nSTEM promises a wondrous, prosperous, techno-shiny future. It exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. In the developed world, the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum total of the latter. Speaking of which, once a city is immersed in \\u201csmart\\u201d tech, it\\u2019s likely to become a special target of hackers. Imagine the potential chaos.)\\n\\nThere have been various reports of adverse effects when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, almost certainly implying 5Gmmw. This would seem unlikely, virtually impossible, outside cities/populous areas.\\n\\nApparently, people see new infrastructure dense or not, or/and feel effects, and apparently assume MMW is in use, as we saw in the Bern example.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d harm stories consistently report symptoms existing before anyone even heard of 5G. Long before. All reported harms I\\u2019ve seen are classic 2G-4G symptoms, and mostly of the \\u2018Electrohypersensitivity\\u2019 type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\nRadiation/RF-level meters have been used to support claims. But RF meters don\\u2019t display frequencies, only power level within a range of frequencies. Ordinary meters, costing from around $120 to $400, top out at 8 GHz. 3G/4G mobile frequencies range from 600 megahertz to 2.5 GHz in the US, with 3.5 GHz coming. WiFi is 2.4 and 5 GHz. Recall, FCC defines 5Gmmw as 24 GHz to 90 GHz. Thus, current meters can\\u2019t read MMW.\\n\\nA true 5G phone would identify MMW (and MLB at this point). Professional (very expensive) meters cover low and high ranges into the upper GHz (I found one 10 MHz to 220 GHz), but also don\\u2019t display frequencies, so all frequencies present still couldn\\u2019t be identified.\\n\\nLong-term exposure, perhaps a cumulative effect, is playing into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Thus, if there is harm when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, what\\u2019s shown by existing meters? Not understood by victims and reporters? 4G, one way or another. Hysteria-induced confusion.\\n\\nOne hawker claims its meter can read \\u201c5G\\u201d based on the fact that two new MLB frequencies are used for 5G (mlb). Any old meter does this. This ruse brought to you by \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nMeters are interesting, but not really helpful for most people. Radiation is everywhere; no amount of exposure is safe; most bio-effects below heating are power-independent; and effects may be cumulative (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nA meter might come in handy for someone with outward symptoms and using some form of shielding, for example. It could be seen at what level symptoms abate \\u2013 which doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops. Most likely, it\\u2019s palliation, but it can still save much grief and help people function.\\n\\nWe can come to cautious conclusion about the frequency present by type of effect. Known effects of MMW (a limited volume of science, though growing) differ from MLB effects long reported in the voluminous dismissed science.\\n\\nMMW potentially threatens skin and eyes, but more effects are being reported, although sometimes \\u2018stretched.\\u2019 For example, a paper cited (in an article by a prominent scientist who must remain anonymous) to show that 5Gmmw impacts \\u201cheart rate variability\\u201d was a military directed-energy study (see Author Information) using 94 GHz at 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2). That\\u2019s essentially the \\u201cADS\\u201d system noted earlier.\\n\\nNot only is 75 mW 75 times the main FCC limit (limits vary with frequency), but 94 is a frequency higher than the upper limit of 5Gmmw defined by the FCC, and certainly wouldn\\u2019t be used in mobile applications. Making cases?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not that MMW can\\u2019t create MLB effects, but it\\u2019s a bit speculative at this point. It\\u2019s possible, however \\u201c\\u2026since nerves, blood vessels and other electrically conducting structures can carry radiation-induced currents deep into the body\\u201d (see section 5G is qualitatively and quantitatively different from 4G)\\n\\nAntenna technology called MIMO (pron. my-mo) has been around for about a decade now for MLB. The more recent development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, meaning many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming (and receiving) beams of radiation. It looks to be destined for both FR1 and FR2 (a virtual necessity for MMW). As noted, Sprint will use this at for 5G at 3.5 GHz.\\n\\nOne question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose an additional threat. It\\u2019s possible they have an effect different from traditional antennas. Also, it seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of many focused beams, although being immersed in a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\nIn any case, aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying a beam from point to point (line of sight) avoids high power output per beam, since penetration of intervening structures isn\\u2019t required.\\n\\nHysteria often warns of outrageously high power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d As noted, effects occur at all levels below heating, which is why 3G/4G need to go. And it would not behoove the industry for people to suddenly be suffering heat damage.\\n\\nDetails of several typical news reports follow. Most demonstrate the fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one shows a more general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\nThe story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from a Verizon antenna installed near the home illustrates confusion. The first video on this page shows testimony before the Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with the mayor present.\\n\\nThe type of antenna isn\\u2019t given. But it\\u2019s probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. We learned from the \\u201cgushing PR piece\\u201d cited in the 5G Rollouts section that Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strange that the testimony date precedes the stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests prior to the grand \\u201cunveiling,\\u201d so it could have been an early \\u201cHome\\u201d antenna. Or maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\nThe opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that ambiguous statement mean to the person who wrote it? To the viewer? The incident suggests harm (cold/flu symptoms) from 5Gmmw but still reinforces the importance of knowing what we mean when we say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\nThe mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although her prepared speech commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but the suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness, even though levels \\u201care still very high\\u201d will certainly be taken officially as \\u201ccorrelation,\\u201d not proof or even evidence.\\n\\nTypically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\nBottom line: Which 5G is present is academic, since the pre-\\u201c5G\\u201d endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal. Focus on \\u201c5G\\u201d is like fretting about a wildfire 10 miles away while your house is burning down.\\n\\nOne of the more outrageous opposition-induced hysterias in recent times is a story from Gateshead, a town in northern UK near the North Sea, that new LED street lights (no microwave fixtures on them, just the lights) were emitting \\u201c5G\\u201d and causing health issues. This was carelessly picked up by other outlets. No one gave a moment\\u2019s thought to the likelihood that it might be LED lights themselves.\\n\\nA news report from Cincinnati clearly demonstrates that folks are in the dark about what 5G is, thanks to hysteria. And a fairly well-known one from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, to its credit, shows a better general awareness of wireless threat. But both demonstrate questionable thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make them safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem).\\n\\nScroll down this page to see an RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story. Regardless of one\\u2019s opinion of RT, this one\\u2019s a great and accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\nThe original story from 9/20/19 (now includes an update) is a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria,\\u201d since no one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers up to this point. It involves a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that \\u201cpeople fear\\u201d will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d.\\n\\nThe 9/27/19 update shows a video interview with a concerned nurse, a conditioned \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacking understanding of the wireless threat. She\\u2019ll feel safer if that nasty tall tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\nThe tall, new-look tower with the cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video) is clearly not the massive MIMO 5Gmmw/small-cell type shown in the 5G-phone report in the 5G Rollouts section. That was Verizon\\u2019s.\\n\\nThe update also says the tower is Sprint\\u2019s. As noted, Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using massive MIMO. It being a Sprint tower, it\\u2019s not MMW. The \\u201c5G\\u201d fear was an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\nSo what\\u2019s in the cylindrical fixture? Could be 4G (LTE), 5Gmlb (\\u201c5G\\u201d), WiFi as well? WiMax? One question \\u2013 is it MIMO? Massive? Anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\nThe update notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are also popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman David Weissmann confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what? From what we\\u2019ve seen of Verizon, probably 5Gmlb, i.e., 4G LTE on FR1 steroids.\\n\\nThe San Joaquin report, from 3/12/19 also concerns a tall tower with a cylindrical fixture. But this isn\\u2019t about 5G, but about \\u201ca cell tower\\u201d being too close to an elementary school in Ripon with a \\u2018cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\n\\u201cAll in all, three teachers and four students have been battling various cancers since 2016,\\u201d as well as a 22-year-old former male student. Of course, those teachers and that young man \\u2018never\\u2019 used a wireless device, and never near that tower. Nor were they exposed to another tower or anyone else\\u2019s phone. This doesn\\u2019t seem to dawn on people.\\n\\nThe Ripon case is interesting. An independent expert was consulted, who contradicted official assurance that the tower tested within federal standards. He said he wouldn\\u2019t send his kids there, because kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed \\u2013 as if they\\u2019re not exposed 24/7 anywhere a phone/tower system is working, not only from towers, but many phones as well. And does he think that once you\\u2019re \\u201cdeveloped\\u201d it\\u2019s OK?\\n\\nSprint subsequently shut it down and agreed to relocate, guilty or not. The move was good PR, and indicates that companies and municipalities will back down \\u2013 probably to avoid litigation, since that could open floodgates.\\n\\nRipon is important for two more reasons. The first is the usually overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure (see History of Official Awareness below). It\\u2019s well known, for example, that effects from cigarette tobacco and ionizing radiation (like a hospital X-ray), are cumulative. There\\u2019s no reason wireless radiation should be any different.\\n\\nMost kids are heavily exposed in our wireless world, wherever they are \\u2013 many from conception, and even before that, especially to ovarian DNA damage. This is one egregious crime of the technology.\\n\\nThe second reason is the bogus advice that \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the false argument for slow death over quicker death, or the futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can even make things worse. The farther the source, the greater are reflection and refraction of signals, creating a far more chaotic condition for the body to handle. Any telecom/WiFi antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\nReducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usually usage tips but also lower exposure limits. Despite calls for the latter, it holds mostly for heating. For non-heating effects, lower power could even increase the threat, since there\\u2019s a good chance that the closer we get to the minute power levels used by biosystems for intercellular communication, a greater confusion sets in.\\n\\nWith regard to usage tips, \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures accumulate over time to engender serious disease \\u2013 of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem, whose damage these clever warnings for humans worsen.\\n\\nThe problem is that reliance on power level alone to determine safety is largely a convenience (there\\u2019s that fatal word again), not science. The reader doesn\\u2019t need to understand the following terms, just that there are several factors in play, including whether the signal is continuous or pulsed, the shape of the pulsations, the rise time, fall time and duration of the pulsations, the type and depth of modulation, the frequencies, and the bandwidth.\\n\\nTry to set a \\u201csafe\\u201d exposure limit based on all that. So they keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\nA corollary is that folks claiming harm seem to think it\\u2019s for the first time. This is fatal error. There are also stories wherein people or animals affected by, say, a Smart meter, regard symptom abatement when the meter is removed as complete recovery. More fatal error. People have no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway. By now, the reader should know why.\\n\\nAn Idaho organization, ehsidaho.com, collects reports on the incidence and effects of what\\u2019s being called electrohypersensitivity, or EHS. The term is misleading, because no living thing is unaffected by the radiation, whether it manifests outwardly or not. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 is suggested.\\n\\nAn estimated 35% of the population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\nClaire Edwards, a former UN staffer, top writer and wireless activist said to me in an email that an estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. The rest of society is virtually thumbing its nose at these unfortunate people. But they\\u2019ll also suffer if this red flag is ignored: As bad as this sensitivity is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad, either in incidence or severity, as things could quickly and easily get.\\n\\nIllness caused by wireless radiation is not new or unique to it, even though there are lists and categories of issues attributed to it. In medicine, a symptom can be caused by any number of influences, and a single influence can cause various symptoms.\\n\\nSo a big question is, how much of today\\u2019s ongoing ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 that is, defined and named prior to the wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to telecom/WiFi radiation (or even the whole radiation gamut to which we expose ourselves)?\\n\\nIf officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\nThus even for EMF-sick users \\u2014 who are much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors (oblivious) attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\nBut quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 is what must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\nManifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere (see The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026).\\n\\nIf we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\nOf the several historical documents acknowledging the deleterious effects of artificial electromagnetic fields denied by FCC, the definitive one for wireless tech seems to be a 1981 World Health Organization (WHO) report entitled Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973. (I\\u2019ve always thought it unfortunate and instructive that \\u201cenvironmental health\\u201d is not about techno-human torment of Earth, but concern about just payback for the tormentor).\\n\\nThe report is long, covering many aspects. It covers all telecom/WiFi frequencies, including MMW; but real-world harm for the last three decades has come, and continues from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\nAs forthright as the WHO publication purports to be, the Summary reveals a distressing ruthlessness. It\\u2019s all most people need to read to understand that \\u2018they\\u2019 knew. For reader convenience, a brief review follows.\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.3 Biological effects in experimental animals: It has been demonstrated that low-level, long-term exposure may induce effects in the nervous, haematopoietic (production of blood cells and platelets), and immuno-competent cell systems of animals. Such effects have been reported in small animals (rodents) exposed to incident power density levels as low as 0.1-1.0 mW/cm2\\u201d (\\u201cmW\\u201d = milliwatt \\u2013 one thousandth of a watt). So this is one tenth of one thousandth of a watt to one thousandth of a watt per square centimeter. FCC limit: one thousandth of a watt \\u2013 1 mW/cm2 (for frequencies 1500 MHz \\u2013 100 GHz).\\n\\n\\u201cThe reported effects on the nervous system include behavioural, bioelectrical, metabolic, and structural (at the cellular and subcellular levels) changes. Erythrocyte production and haemaglobin synthesis may be impaired and immunological reactivity changed.\\u201d OK so far (except for exploiting/hurting animals).\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.6: Health risk evaluation as a basis for exposure limits: \\u2026 A highly conservative approach would be to keep exposure limits close to natural background levels. However, this is not technically feasible [emphasis added]. A reasonable risk-benefit analysis has to be considered.\\u201d\\n\\nIs \\u201chighly conservative\\u201d a euphemism for \\u201csafe\\u201d? And what does \\u201cclose\\u201d mean? In any case, the \\u201cbackground level,\\u201c called the cosmic background is 0.0000000001 \\u2013 0.000000000000001 \\u00b5W/cm2 (\\u00b5W = microwatt \\u2013 one millionth of a watt). Thus, the higher background limit (first one) is one ten billionth of a millionth of a watt (sounds like just a few electrons to me \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nFCC limit is on the other side of the decimal point at 1000 \\u00b5W/cm2. a thousand millionths of a watt \\u2013 per square centimeter, that is. Frankly, the author\\u2019s head goes into a spin with these minuscule decimals, but it\\u2019s safe to say there\\u2019s a bit of a margin between FCC and Cosmos \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nThe FCC limit is outrageous even compared to the most conservative proposed \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit: .003 \\u2013 .006 \\u00b5W/cm2. and the BioInitiative Report authors say it might even need to be lower..\\n\\nImportantly, however, the cosmic variety is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed). That means there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limit after all: zero.\\n\\n\\u201cNot technically feasible\\u201d? Well, of course. Technology is more important than health in some minds. \\u201cReasonable risk-benefit\\u201d? The Summary doesn\\u2019t say how many sick or dead per million is reasonable. (Please see also)\\n\\nOne wonders if they were aware of earlier studies, referred to by Andrew Michrowski, PhD at the 2009 Toronto Whole Life Expo (see section, Key Testimony in Toronto in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMichrowski interprets the data for us: \\u201cAnalysis of 1950 -1974 mortality of 40,000 Korean War veterans shows that microwave exposure effect is cumulative [emphasis added] it affects all deaths \\u2026 doubling to tripling cancers of eye, brain and central nervous system, lymphatic and hematopoietic [blood-cell/platelet-forming] and digestive systems. This means that even \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures from wireless systems accumulate over the years and decades to engender serious diseases\\u201d (can\\u2019t be said too often).\\n\\nNor do we know if the Warsaw International Symposium or its WHO reviewers were aware that the US military and others conducted microwave stealth-weapon research in the 1950s. This technology became 2G. See Sections Assault: From Weapon to Telecom and Ultimate Atrocity in the Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nOpposition warnings frequently emphasize \\u2018protecting you and your family.\\u2019 The point having been made several times is worth repeating: The most dire threat is to the ecosystem, not humans. No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\nEnvironment usually suffers in the background of hysteria. One will see lists something like this: \\u201chealth, privacy, security, and the environment.\\u201d\\n\\nThose who offer exposure \\u201csolutions\\u201d or \\u201ctips\\u201d seem to forget that no form or amount of human protection does so for Nature. A false sense of security in being \\u201csafer\\u201d leads to continued use and support of the overall system, immeasurably intensifying that threat.\\n\\nInsects, for example, are highly susceptible to telecom/WiFi microwave, especially to MMW, which we haven\\u2019t even had yet. In the last quarter century or so, coinciding closely with the introduction of 2G, 75% of the biomass of insects has disappeared in otherwise protected areas in Germany. Meaning it\\u2019s probably worse where other threats co-exist.\\n\\nEmphatically: The wireless threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. We need to look at the context of wireless, which is technology, per se. And one thing is certain about most of that, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\nIn almost all cases, somewhere along the line from resource acquisition (especially mining) to manufacture, use, and disposal, advanced technology is chemically/energetically toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless encompasses the entire line of a process of Earth liquidation/sacrifice for human \\u201cneeds\\u201d \\u2013 money, convenience, and entertainment (see section The Price of Techno-Civilization in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMoving to \\u201cwired\\u201d telecom/WiFi will not stop this assault. Countries are under siege for resources. Nor will the Elite psyops \\u201cSustainable Development\\u201d and \\u201cClean Renewable Energy\\u201d stop it. But that\\u2019s another article.\\n\\nThe attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed. I ask that anyone who can name a major environmental or health crisis in which technology isn\\u2019t the cause or doesn\\u2019t play a major role, comment about it.\\n\\nLooking at the overall output of \\u201cconcerned\\u201d EMF scientists and activists, however, if one isn\\u2019t careful, one could conclude it\\u2019s thought that humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\nAnother major concern is disproportionate attention on local antennas, while a massive satellite program proceeds. At one point, up to 20,000 satellites were planned to blanket the globe. But the number keeps growing.\\n\\nMadman Elon Musk\\u2019s SpaceX had dibs on 12,000 for 5Gmmw. Here is news that Madman is applying for 30,000 more. Just 42,000 satellites will be about 5 times the total spacecraft launched since 1957 (8,500).\\n\\nSeveral other companies, including Boeing, OneWeb, Amazon, Facebook, not to mention Russia and China, mean many thousands more. Total madness could bring it to somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000. This considered sane. Why? Because insanity unrecognized as such has become the norm in the culture of toxic-technomasturbation.\\n\\nPollution. Some 150 tons of refined kerosene and 340 tons of liquid oxygen per Musk 5G launch (60 satellites, 400 kg each). Do the math, even for 12,000. There seems to be no concern for consequences, such as potential damage to the ozone layer, major interference with earth\\u2019s energy field, or even increased atmospheric CO2 (for the faithful). Not to mention, decline of breathable free oxygen (very cool dynamic graph).\\n\\nMuch seems to be up in the air on the satellite program. Since launches proceed in haste, the plan seems to be shoot them up first, answer proprietary questions later, dismissing anyone else\\u2019s. In Europe, there are currently calls for papers on satellite integration with 5G, with submissions deadline being the Ides of March 2020.\\n\\nNASA, NOAA, meteorologists, (and radio astronomers) have issued valid concerns about MMW. FCC has dismissed them, too. Yet, NASA intends to participate in this bit of insanity.\\n\\nMight such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates? Insane is a good word for it, but psychopathic puts a more specific tag on it. See subsections Same Old Story\\u2026 and \\u2026with a Twist in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nThe best way to beat 5G, on the ground at least, is to quit wireless tech flat. Little demand \\u2018down here\\u2019 could greatly reduce incentive to invest \\u2018up there\\u2019. If there is a total-surveillance and human-control system gestating in the technosphere, how much of a role could satellites play?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strongly suggested that an outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the one on earthbound antennas.\\n\\nTaking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\nAgain, a race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse. Allowing classic 4G (or even just 5G FR1) to continue potentiates imminent disaster. Both scenarios are in progress, but at the \\u2018deniable\\u2019 stage. When \\u2018undeniable\\u2019 sets in, the slope will almost certainly have become too steep and slippery.\\n\\nExperience shows that science-based appeals, to governments at all levels; to national and international regulatory bodies, and so on is an exercise in futility due to multiple factors, including corruption, disbelief, and intimidation. Old and chronic conditions.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s in the People\\u2019s hands now, at the commercial level. Either common sense prevails over addiction and selfishness, or we wait for the race to end and hope it\\u2019s not too late.\\n\\nGive up wireless per se or give up the future \\u2013 liberty first, then life. If not, then welcome all 5G, especially the satellites. Surrender to it will mercifully shorten the coming agony.\\n\\nPeter Tocci is a retired massage therapist and wellness consultant with an abiding interest in exploring \\u2018managed\\u2019 history, nefarious covert agendas, and mainstream/mainstream-alternative news-media dereliction, distortion and suppression.

Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\nWithout any help from \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers, the \\u201cnext generation\\u201d wireless is very dangerous \\u2014 all by itself \\u2014 as is each previous G by itself. But due to hysteria (illogic, inaccuracies and omissions), most opposition is also dangerous by itself.\\n\\nNot much has changed since this PC Mag article was published in 1/2019. And that doesn\\u2019t cover all critical aspects.\\n\\nConfusion begins right off the bat with the term \\u201c5G.\\u201d It\\u2019s being flung carelessly about, in articles, protests, news reports, corporate bulletins, by politicians \\u2013 even by scientists, and in submissions and comments to official bodies.\\n\\nAlmost always implied when \\u201c5G\\u201d is uttered \\u2013 especially, \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d or \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d \\u2013 is use of the \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This causes misunderstanding and potential danger.\\n\\nOverall, EHF is specified as 30 GHz to 300 GHz, and wavelength 10 millimeters to 1mm respectively. Only a small portion of that range is used in high-frequency 5G operation, and is defined in the US by the FCC as 24 GHz to 90 GHz.\\n\\nAs explained below in 5G Rollouts, for accuracy one must at least distinguish between 1) \\u2018small-cell\\u2019 infrastructure and 5G/small cells per se; 2) between 5G infrastructure and 5G high-frequency radiation; 3) between antennas and their enclosures, and **4) between high frequency 5G and mid-/low-band 5G, the signaling long used for 2G-4G iterations.\\n\\nNew terms are offered here for consistency and for clarifying hysteria-induced misunderstanding and confusion: \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d is a housing for antennas (sending/receiving elements). A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\nOne might see warnings such as: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSmall cell\\u201d is regularly misused, even by the Industry. Accurately speaking, a cell is not an antenna, but the effective area/range of an antenna\\u2019s radiation. 5Gmmw has a short range, which decreases with higher frequency. Thus, its cell is comparatively small.\\n\\nAlso, MMW can easily be blocked, even by even leaves and heavy rain, which deficiency increases with increasing frequency. Both drawbacks can be improved with a substantial power boost, but this also becomes a problem with energy cost and exposure levels, and so is not under consideration. Energy consumption is a major concern for the industry, which is feverishly at work to solve it.\\n\\nShort range and easy \\u2018blockability\\u2019 require more fixture locations, which hysteria frets about, rarely noting the distinction that 5Gmlb makes a large cell and is not blocked. Call it nitpicking if you will, but why not be accurate instead of creating misconception or \\u2018making cases\\u2019?\\n\\n\\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density, and common hysteria about how it will be implemented are in serious question (more later).\\n\\nOne interesting discovery came up while working on this article: Small cells are small but not new, and were not developed for 5G. Small cells have long been deployed in 3G and 4G networks and have become an industry choice to deliver MMW and enable better MLB performance if needed.\\n\\nTraditionally, there have been three types of small cells (more now), identified as they should be by antenna range. Some early deployments were in the US in 2007 and in the UK and Europe in 2009. \\u201cAccording to Small Cell Forum (who would have thought?), 18 million small cells had been deployed globally for various applications by the end of 2016.\\u201d\\n\\nBut haven\\u2019t we been led in a virtually deliberate way from the outset, and even continue to be, to think that 5G is small cells/MMW? Saying \\u201c5G\\u201d to indicate only these two things, or not specifying what you mean, is irresponsible, inaccurate, and misleading, as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nA 10/8/19 bulletin from Project Censored was forwarded to me via an email group that received it from Joel M. Moskowitz, PhD, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at UC Berkeley. A typically careless statement consisting of an error and a question mark says, \\u201cThe telecom industry is promoting the replacement of the current cellular network, known as 4G, with a new generation of higher frequency 5G wavelengths to power the \\u201cInternet of Things\\u2026\\u201d As a generalization, this is either shameful unawareness of the current scenario or untruth/propaganda, as we\\u2019ll also see.\\n\\n5G opposition also asserts that the skin\\u2019s (spiral) sweat ducts act as \\u201creceiving antennas.\\u201d This refers to an Israeli study, \\u201cThe human skin as a sub-THz receiver \\u2013 Does 5G pose a danger to it or not?\\u201d\\n\\nFrequency ranges don\\u2019t transition abruptly, but sub-THz usually means a range of 300 GHz down to 90, which is the upper end of FCC 5Gmmw.\\n\\nThe study Abstract uses two unquantified terms, \\u201csub-terahertz band\\u201d and \\u201csub-THz region.\\u201d I think \\u201cregion\\u201d is more accurate, meaning the range, or \\u201cspectrum\\u201d as understood in tech circles. \\u201cBand\\u201d is used to designate a single frequency, but also is an interval between a lower and upper frequency. For instance, a transmission between 40 and 50 MHz is a 10 MHz band (width).\\n\\nStudy frequencies were 75 GHz to 110 GHz. No wireless provider I\\u2019m aware of (in the US) has announced a mobile 5Gmmw service anywhere near 75 GHz. There was no explanation in the Abstract why announced commercial frequencies were not used.\\n\\nPower-level exposure limits at the user end are expressed in watts per area, usually square meter or square centimeter. No such levels are provided for the targets used, but maybe that\\u2019s not relevant in this case.\\n\\nThe highest commercial frequency I could find being tested is in the UK (though also approved for US), is 60 GHz. At least one rural test area is reportedly using a 60 GHz \\u201cwireless mesh\\u201d (interior network of interacting antennas) for \\u2018super WiFi.\\u2019 Not for mobile and still not up to 75 GHz.\\n\\nInteresting is that other UK rural testbeds are running unused TV bands called \\u201cTV white space\\u201d \\u2014 the old VHF to UHF frequencies, mostly MHz bands. This is 5G, mind you.\\n\\nHowever, bandwidths 71 to 76 GHz, 81 to 86 GHz and 92 to 95 GHz are available in the US for \\u201chigh-density\\u201d (high power) \\u201cfixed wireless access\\u201d services: \\u201c\\u2026the operation of wireless communication devices or systems used to connect two fixed locations (e.g., building to building or tower to building) with a radio or other wireless link\\u2026\\u201d, which would have to be line-of-sight and are not for mobile.\\n\\nAs noted, the higher the frequency, the greater are transmission challenges, so high-density bands would be very tight beams, with minimal to no obstacles and no human exposure (watch out, pigeons). Due to excess electricity consumption, MMW signals probably won\\u2019t be power boosted sufficiently to penetrate buildings, but be brought in via cable from an external receiver, then be distributed via a wireless network.\\n\\nStudy conclusion: \\u201cWe are raising a warning flag against the unrestricted use of sub-THz technologies for communication, before the possible consequences for public health are explored.\\u201d This seems sane enough \\u2013 within the insane context called wireless telecom/WiFi. See Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (needs updating).\\n\\nBut \\u201cunrestricted\\u201d at least suggests the impossible, that restrictions could prevent all trouble. Note also \\u201cpossible consequences.\\u201d This can\\u2019t be valid for harm in general, which is a fact long understood \\u2013 almost three decades before 2G came out (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\nWhen this warning is given, we don\\u2019t hear that the \\u201cwarning flag\\u201d would apply conceptually to all G\\u2019s; presumes there is a safe dose of MLB somewhere; and, as usual, neglects the ecosystem. But \\u2014 enough for protesters to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas? Making cases? I confess I fell for this one in my early research on wireless. A more likely, but still speculative, concern is discussed in Reports of \\u201c5G\\u201d Harm.\\n\\nAnother common warning, \\u201c5G is a weapon,\\u201d usually refers to the military\\u2019s Active Denial System, a \\u201cnon-lethal\\u201d microwave device for dispersing crowds by heating the skin. It\\u2019s a high density (power) millimeter wave at 95 GHz \\u2013 hardly commercial 5Gmmw.\\n\\nMMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G. Wireless telecom, beginning with 2G, is adapted stealth-weapon technology which uses very low power. The entire wireless system, not just \\u201c5G\\u201d, is a potential weapon on various levels (more below).\\n\\nAlso, high-enough density microwave \\u2014 at a \\u2018lowly\\u2019 2.5 GHz, for example \\u2014 will cook you like a microwave oven (2.45 GHz). That is, through and through, unlike ADS. At commercial power levels, 5Gmmw will not.\\n\\nA powerful Air Force radar system called Pave Paws at three US locations will cook you in a nanosecond at 420 to 450 MHz. Installations have two large circular arrays of antenna elements, each array radiating 580 kilowatts (!) It can detect a basketball at 12 miles, and small planes caught in the beam have blown up. So don\\u2019t swallow the rhetoric about telecom MMW weaponry.\\n\\nI was unable to find a range of ADS power output, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study calling out 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2) at 94 GHz (see Reports of Harm). ADS power is adjustable, however, enough to be used as a lethal weapon. But \\u2013 \\u2018making cases\\u2019 again?\\n\\nMicrowave ovens operate from 600 to 1200 watts. By comparison, maximum output of traditional cell towers is 10 watts \\u2013 phones, 2 watts. The higher frequency/shorter wavelength was chosen for ADS to limit penetration depth. Not saying that\\u2019s a good thing, not to mention it\\u2019s misleading (see Reports of Harm).\\n\\nFinding a wattage output figure for new, 5G MLB or MMW antennas proved fruitlessly time consuming (anyone?), but I did find a study establishing a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for a particular 5Gmmw antenna design for 28 and 38 GHz.\\n\\nSAR is an expression of how much radiation from a phone is absorbed over time by the body. It\\u2019s expressed in watts per kilogram (W/kg). Values were \\u201c\\u20260.37 and 1.34 W/kg [up to] 2 W/kg. Current FCC SAR standard is 1.6W/kg. This is given just for a sense of comparison, because SAR is useless for determining the amount of radiofrequency (RF) absorption in biosystems during typical conditions of use. See Safety Testing below.\\n\\nMany opposers suggest that 3G/4G/WiFi can be made reasonably safe. Others understand that impossibility, but seem too habituated and addicted to do the right thing. As noted in the Introduction, techno-humans are adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\n\\u201cNo \\u20185G\\u2019 safety studies have been conducted or funded by the Federal Communications Commission or the telecom industry, and none is planned.\\u201d Or simply, \\u201c5G has not been tested for safety\\u201d. Or the like. No such claims provide the facts.\\n\\nThat the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d terror, whereas, the real terror is wireless tech per se. Inherent in this ploy is the erroneous implication that 2G-4G were tested (a yes and no proposition).\\n\\nIn 1996, FCC adopted the standard identified as ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992. There were \\u2018window dressings\\u2019 in 2004, 2005, and 2010, and, like the original, covered frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019. (Overall \\u2018microwave\\u2019 is considered to be 300 MHz (.3 GHz) to 300 GHz.\\n\\nThe Commission\\u2019s assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is based on the fraudulent IEEE \\u2018testing\\u2019 it adopted in 1996 to run interference for 3G. That is, if the radiation doesn\\u2019t heat you, it can\\u2019t harm you.\\n\\nThis author warned of this response by FCC in February 2019 as \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria was powering up: Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised? Exposure limits worldwide are based on the ANSI/IEEE C95.1 fraud.\\n\\nPeer reviewed independent science, as early as the 1950s and still going, demonstrating myriad effects at non-heating levels, brings the integrity of C95.1-1992 through 2019 into question. Was *proper* testing ever done? Instead of clarifying this, hysteria makes the blanket claim. Making cases.\\n\\nThe FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science and such questions: \\u2018No convincing evidence exists, but we\\u2019re keeping an eye on it.\\u2019 The blatant criminality of the FCC with respect to wireless/EMF is clearly demonstrated by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nHysteria often resorts to another \\u2018ploy on words\\u2019 pertaining to 2G-4G, and used even by scientists, as seen near the end of this report: \\u201cThe current FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d The word implies that standards were at one time valid or sufficient, when they were never any such thing, for any living thing.\\n\\n\\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing has been demonstrated or can exist. Despite this, new limits are proposed and stubbornly called for \\u2014 in spite of the consensus that no safe level has even been published for fetuses.\\n\\nApparently, that\\u2019s not of sufficient concern to call for \\u201cStop Wireless Technology!\\u201d instead of \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d We\\u2019ll figure that fetus part out later.\\n\\nFor details on the original \\u2018safety\\u2019 testing \\u2013 scientific fraud, that is, on which power-level exposure limits worldwide are based \\u2013 see Sections Cell Phone Output and Exposure Limits for Users in the article Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\nMajor emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA,\\u2019 due to the short range and easy block-ability of MMW. But things seem to be developing differently for now, as we\\u2019ll see. As noted, even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\nThe following synthesis is the result of wading through too many articles to give credit to any one. Some sources tell varying stories about the same thing, and even disagree with each other considerably.\\n\\nSo here goes: A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard has been issued, specifying two frequency ranges: 5G NR bands FR1 & 5G NR bands FR2. Number one is for current bands below 6 GHz (5Gmlb), such as 600MHz, 1900MHz, and 2.5GHz; two is for MMW \\u2014 mostly 24 to 40 GHz for mobile, and higher for special applications (not mobile). In the near term, public WiFi will remain separate at MLB, 2.45 GHz and 5 GHz, but Verizon, for example, is offering 5Gmmw home internet/WiFi (not mobile) in limited areas of four cities.\\n\\n5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention at this point, including especially \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and \\u2018beamforming\\u2019 (more later).\\n\\nHowever, 5G NR FR1 can use the same towers as 4G, but will need new antennas. It has the same reach and penetration, but with shorter delay, while providing up to 35 percent more speed. The wireless addict\\u2019s dream. When you think about it, FR1 should really be 5G, and 5Gmmw, 6G.\\n\\nPlans are also in place for deployments using the unlicensed, Citizens Broadband Radio Service 3.5 GHz band, and all key players really want in. This is MLB called 5G, mind you.\\n\\nThings get a bit stickier when it comes to needing a new phone or not. Many current phones should be able to get updates to process FR1, but a new phone is needed for FR2. Generally, the \\u201ctech\\u201d advice is not to move yet, and here\\u2019s an example with Samsung\\u2019s $1300 5G Galaxy S10 being tested in Chicago (good shot of a 5Gmmw \\u201cnode\\u201d here).\\n\\nThe \\u201chold off\\u201d sentiment is conveyed also in this article. What it amounts to at this writing is that 5Gmmw is virtually at a \\u201cdemo\\u201d stage, not full coverage and service, even in town.\\n\\nMany \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers continue to use traditional 3G/4G/WiFi wireless, either knowing the danger or believing it\\u2019s safe, or will be, because they just want it. A possible motive driving hysteria?\\n\\nAnother possible motive for \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, or maybe just the effect it\\u2019s having, is to create a threat on the ground to draw resistance and to distract attention from the satellite program, a much more sinister development (see Examining Priorities below).\\n\\nThe disconnect about dangers brings up a story that drew wide attention at the time, especially in the UK, and one that seems to present a puzzle. It\\u2019s about the 6/26 2019 Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, Somerset County, England. It\\u2019s not strictly a \\u201crollout\\u201d story, more a system demo/test, but a decision was announced about installing \\u201c5G\\u201d network towers on festival grounds,\\n\\nDespite the fact that \\u201cGlastonbury officials [said] that move will allow festival attendees to access the Internet on their smartphones at faster speeds,\\u201d the announcement created a huge protest. In this story, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G are mentioned, but \\u201c5G\\u201d is not specified as MLB or MMW \\u2014 as anything, in other words. Is this hysteria-induced negligence?\\n\\nThe protest article is laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated one that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d. Even some much-admired professional associates/contacts promote this irresponsible notion. I must respectfully, but strongly, disagree, because the erroneous implication is that 2G-4G were/are not an experiment. Paradoxically, they were/are and were/are not experiments. Distinctions must be made (more below).\\n\\nConfusion again: \\u201cWhile obviously not many festival-goers are likely to have a \\u20185G\\u2019 phone by June, EE will be showing off what the network can do at its stand.\\u201d Once again, unspecified 5G. So, was the Glastonbury demo about 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb? Whatever, tickets sold out in less than 45 minutes.\\n\\nThe grand protest by potential attendees was both tragic and macabrely amusing: They were prepared to irradiate themselves constantly in huge numbers (up to 200,000 fans in attendance potentially using phones/smartphones), but fretted over \\u201c5G\\u201d, not even knowing it could have been their beloved 4G poison\\u2026reborn. Phone radiation is often overlooked.\\n\\nSimilarly, reports on the 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland clearly reflect the confusion and negligent use of \\u201c5G.\\u201d This Agence France-Presse story says, \\u201cBy early July, 334 antennae (sic) stations for 5G were operational across the country, authorities have told AFP.\\u201d Boy, watch out for authorities.\\n\\nAntenna location and density info aren\\u2019t revealed, but it could be urban or \\u2018near-urban.\\u2019 The number doesn\\u2019t seem to correspond to FLD in neighborhoods, but who knows, thanks to incomplete reporting (and perhaps misled authorities). The news reader is therefore in the dark about exactly what\\u2019s going on, but probably assumes it\\u2019s MMW. Due to\\u2026 \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s (but beginning much earlier). What was known then was later hushed in the runup to digital mobile telecom in 1991-2.\\n\\nThe decision was callously made long ago to put life/people at risk to have the technology (see History of Official Awareness below). Thus, the yes/no \\u201cexperiment\\u201d is not whether there will be harm from telecom/WiFi microwave, but the time window in which ongoing exposure damage \\u2014 across all frequencies and regardless of power level \\u2014 will manifest in a cascade of widespread intractable illness.\\n\\nNot to worry, though, that fate might be avoided: Ecosystem collapse could bring the house down beforehand. You might hear/see, \\u201cThe 5G race is on,\\u201d meaning market competition. The race of note, though, is between ecosystem collapse and human-health collapse.\\n\\nIn any case, here\\u2019s some of what\\u2019s happening in \\u2018real\\u2019 life. The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon. Carriers are choosing service areas for FR1, FR2 very carefully.\\n\\nT-Mobile has announced a nationwide 5Gmlb rollout at 600 MHz and an undisclosed application of \\u201c28 and 39\\u201d (see video), which means some 5Gmmw, almost certainly in cities.\\n\\nSprint\\u2019s plans are to run \\u201cLTE and 5G\\u201d simultaneously in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\nMentioned earlier, Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d (allegedly MMW \\u2013 5Gmmw) is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range to cover wide area\\u201d (5Gmlb), doesn\\u2019t say where.\\n\\nSacramento seems to be the most enthusiastic victim host for wireless. Here\\u2019s a gushing PR piece about a Verizon UWB installation at one Sacramento citizen\\u2019s home, with City officials attending. It features an external receiver. Sacramento also prides itself on opening the floodgates for \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more later).\\n\\nVerizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas, which could be its final destination. Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason. Ecocidal, terminally pathological 3G/4G still rages, again reflecting the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nThe forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. As noted earlier, drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for \\u201c18 million new\\u201d closely spaced fixtures nationwide. Given the above information on FR1 rollouts, there seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\nA report on new Qualcomm smartphone antennas supports the foregoing. It covers four bands between 26.5GHz and 40 GHz, but also antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 The QPM56xx RF module family works with the Snapdragon X50 modem to work in the sub-6GHz bands\\u2026\\u201d (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\nOne puzzle: It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) as specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs seem to disagree, saying 4G can handle IoT. Propaganda? Careless chatter? Who knows. It\\u2019s safe to assume, however, they refer to the new 4G/5Gmlb.\\n\\nSome opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. And the attempted widespread deployment of smart utility meters on 4G WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say. 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, because if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\nI didn\\u2019t bother spending the rest of my life trying to find if/where FLD installations are occurring. Anyone who\\u2019s seen close installations in any area, please share details in Comments.\\n\\nNow, if FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose. One, possibility of course, is optimized 5Gmlb performance, as in the past, although this shouldn\\u2019t often be necessary, due to the large cell and penetration of MLB.\\n\\nIn the entrained, FLD frame of mind, I was suspicious in Wireless Technology: \\u2026 (The 5G Locomotive section) of Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams\\u2019 statement in a 5/15/18 CNBC interview that antennas in your face is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019d say he was being coy, implying MLB, and being careful not to depict 5G accurately, since 5Gmmw must have increased FLD, while 5Gmlb, not for the most part.\\n\\nMcAdam touted 5Gmmw for smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality, all good reasons for planetary and health destruction. But remember, all the \\u201cSmart\\u201d out there now is WiFi, for which there is no 5Gmmw (although Verizon\\u2019s UWB Home Internet might qualify). \\u201cSmart\\u201d is the wireless tech word for monumentally stupid \\u2014 and for total surveillance and centralized coordination and control of daily life. See section The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026.\\n\\nNone of the above means things can\\u2019t change. It\\u2019s early. The MLB rollout could be just a prelude to an FLD/MMW invasion. If MMW gets a toe-hold and no one\\u2019s coming up provably sick, and people like it, it could weaken opposition and open floodgates.\\n\\nAnd there\\u2019s the question of how the many thousands of planned satellites (looking now like well more than 50,000) fit into the overall picture. Obviously, coverage comes immediately to mind, such as saturation in outlying areas? For IoT? One issue for satellites, though, is increased delay time (\\u201clatency\\u201d) due to distance. There could be a \\u2018division of labor\\u2019 among various services, such as ground for mobile and sats for entertainment.\\n\\nNote the promise of the nationwide sySTEMic programming to make kids into corporate plug-ins or hitech drones: \\u201cSTEM education emphasizes the value of a rigorous, interdisciplinary approach to education, allowing students to compete and succeed in a modern global marketplace.\\u201d How many dubious assumptions, claims and buzzwords in that PR flak?\\n\\nSTEM promises a wondrous, prosperous, techno-shiny future. It exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. In the developed world, the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum total of the latter. Speaking of which, once a city is immersed in \\u201csmart\\u201d tech, it\\u2019s likely to become a special target of hackers. Imagine the potential chaos.)\\n\\nThere have been various reports of adverse effects when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, almost certainly implying 5Gmmw. This would seem unlikely, virtually impossible, outside cities/populous areas.\\n\\nApparently, people see new infrastructure dense or not, or/and feel effects, and apparently assume MMW is in use, as we saw in the Bern example.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d harm stories consistently report symptoms existing before anyone even heard of 5G. Long before. All reported harms I\\u2019ve seen are classic 2G-4G symptoms, and mostly of the \\u2018Electrohypersensitivity\\u2019 type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\nRadiation/RF-level meters have been used to support claims. But RF meters don\\u2019t display frequencies, only power level within a range of frequencies. Ordinary meters, costing from around $120 to $400, top out at 8 GHz. 3G/4G mobile frequencies range from 600 megahertz to 2.5 GHz in the US, with 3.5 GHz coming. WiFi is 2.4 and 5 GHz. Recall, FCC defines 5Gmmw as 24 GHz to 90 GHz. Thus, current meters can\\u2019t read MMW.\\n\\nA true 5G phone would identify MMW (and MLB at this point). Professional (very expensive) meters cover low and high ranges into the upper GHz (I found one 10 MHz to 220 GHz), but also don\\u2019t display frequencies, so all frequencies present still couldn\\u2019t be identified.\\n\\nLong-term exposure, perhaps a cumulative effect, is playing into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Thus, if there is harm when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, what\\u2019s shown by existing meters? Not understood by victims and reporters? 4G, one way or another. Hysteria-induced confusion.\\n\\nOne hawker claims its meter can read \\u201c5G\\u201d based on the fact that two new MLB frequencies are used for 5G (mlb). Any old meter does this. This ruse brought to you by \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nMeters are interesting, but not really helpful for most people. Radiation is everywhere; no amount of exposure is safe; most bio-effects below heating are power-independent; and effects may be cumulative (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nA meter might come in handy for someone with outward symptoms and using some form of shielding, for example. It could be seen at what level symptoms abate \\u2013 which doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops. Most likely, it\\u2019s palliation, but it can still save much grief and help people function.\\n\\nWe can come to cautious conclusion about the frequency present by type of effect. Known effects of MMW (a limited volume of science, though growing) differ from MLB effects long reported in the voluminous dismissed science.\\n\\nMMW potentially threatens skin and eyes, but more effects are being reported, although sometimes \\u2018stretched.\\u2019 For example, a paper cited (in an article by a prominent scientist who must remain anonymous) to show that 5Gmmw impacts \\u201cheart rate variability\\u201d was a military directed-energy study (see Author Information) using 94 GHz at 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2). That\\u2019s essentially the \\u201cADS\\u201d system noted earlier.\\n\\nNot only is 75 mW 75 times the main FCC limit (limits vary with frequency), but 94 is a frequency higher than the upper limit of 5Gmmw defined by the FCC, and certainly wouldn\\u2019t be used in mobile applications. Making cases?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not that MMW can\\u2019t create MLB effects, but it\\u2019s a bit speculative at this point. It\\u2019s possible, however \\u201c\\u2026since nerves, blood vessels and other electrically conducting structures can carry radiation-induced currents deep into the body\\u201d (see section 5G is qualitatively and quantitatively different from 4G)\\n\\nAntenna technology called MIMO (pron. my-mo) has been around for about a decade now for MLB. The more recent development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, meaning many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming (and receiving) beams of radiation. It looks to be destined for both FR1 and FR2 (a virtual necessity for MMW). As noted, Sprint will use this at for 5G at 3.5 GHz.\\n\\nOne question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose an additional threat. It\\u2019s possible they have an effect different from traditional antennas. Also, it seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of many focused beams, although being immersed in a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\nIn any case, aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying a beam from point to point (line of sight) avoids high power output per beam, since penetration of intervening structures isn\\u2019t required.\\n\\nHysteria often warns of outrageously high power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d As noted, effects occur at all levels below heating, which is why 3G/4G need to go. And it would not behoove the industry for people to suddenly be suffering heat damage.\\n\\nDetails of several typical news reports follow. Most demonstrate the fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one shows a more general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\nThe story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from a Verizon antenna installed near the home illustrates confusion. The first video on this page shows testimony before the Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with the mayor present.\\n\\nThe type of antenna isn\\u2019t given. But it\\u2019s probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. We learned from the \\u201cgushing PR piece\\u201d cited in the 5G Rollouts section that Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strange that the testimony date precedes the stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests prior to the grand \\u201cunveiling,\\u201d so it could have been an early \\u201cHome\\u201d antenna. Or maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\nThe opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that ambiguous statement mean to the person who wrote it? To the viewer? The incident suggests harm (cold/flu symptoms) from 5Gmmw but still reinforces the importance of knowing what we mean when we say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\nThe mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although her prepared speech commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but the suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness, even though levels \\u201care still very high\\u201d will certainly be taken officially as \\u201ccorrelation,\\u201d not proof or even evidence.\\n\\nTypically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\nBottom line: Which 5G is present is academic, since the pre-\\u201c5G\\u201d endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal. Focus on \\u201c5G\\u201d is like fretting about a wildfire 10 miles away while your house is burning down.\\n\\nOne of the more outrageous opposition-induced hysterias in recent times is a story from Gateshead, a town in northern UK near the North Sea, that new LED street lights (no microwave fixtures on them, just the lights) were emitting \\u201c5G\\u201d and causing health issues. This was carelessly picked up by other outlets. No one gave a moment\\u2019s thought to the likelihood that it might be LED lights themselves.\\n\\nA news report from Cincinnati clearly demonstrates that folks are in the dark about what 5G is, thanks to hysteria. And a fairly well-known one from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, to its credit, shows a better general awareness of wireless threat. But both demonstrate questionable thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make them safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem).\\n\\nScroll down this page to see an RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story. Regardless of one\\u2019s opinion of RT, this one\\u2019s a great and accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\nThe original story from 9/20/19 (now includes an update) is a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria,\\u201d since no one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers up to this point. It involves a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that \\u201cpeople fear\\u201d will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d.\\n\\nThe 9/27/19 update shows a video interview with a concerned nurse, a conditioned \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacking understanding of the wireless threat. She\\u2019ll feel safer if that nasty tall tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\nThe tall, new-look tower with the cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video) is clearly not the massive MIMO 5Gmmw/small-cell type shown in the 5G-phone report in the 5G Rollouts section. That was Verizon\\u2019s.\\n\\nThe update also says the tower is Sprint\\u2019s. As noted, Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using massive MIMO. It being a Sprint tower, it\\u2019s not MMW. The \\u201c5G\\u201d fear was an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\nSo what\\u2019s in the cylindrical fixture? Could be 4G (LTE), 5Gmlb (\\u201c5G\\u201d), WiFi as well? WiMax? One question \\u2013 is it MIMO? Massive? Anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\nThe update notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are also popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman David Weissmann confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what? From what we\\u2019ve seen of Verizon, probably 5Gmlb, i.e., 4G LTE on FR1 steroids.\\n\\nThe San Joaquin report, from 3/12/19 also concerns a tall tower with a cylindrical fixture. But this isn\\u2019t about 5G, but about \\u201ca cell tower\\u201d being too close to an elementary school in Ripon with a \\u2018cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\n\\u201cAll in all, three teachers and four students have been battling various cancers since 2016,\\u201d as well as a 22-year-old former male student. Of course, those teachers and that young man \\u2018never\\u2019 used a wireless device, and never near that tower. Nor were they exposed to another tower or anyone else\\u2019s phone. This doesn\\u2019t seem to dawn on people.\\n\\nThe Ripon case is interesting. An independent expert was consulted, who contradicted official assurance that the tower tested within federal standards. He said he wouldn\\u2019t send his kids there, because kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed \\u2013 as if they\\u2019re not exposed 24/7 anywhere a phone/tower system is working, not only from towers, but many phones as well. And does he think that once you\\u2019re \\u201cdeveloped\\u201d it\\u2019s OK?\\n\\nSprint subsequently shut it down and agreed to relocate, guilty or not. The move was good PR, and indicates that companies and municipalities will back down \\u2013 probably to avoid litigation, since that could open floodgates.\\n\\nRipon is important for two more reasons. The first is the usually overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure (see History of Official Awareness below). It\\u2019s well known, for example, that effects from cigarette tobacco and ionizing radiation (like a hospital X-ray), are cumulative. There\\u2019s no reason wireless radiation should be any different.\\n\\nMost kids are heavily exposed in our wireless world, wherever they are \\u2013 many from conception, and even before that, especially to ovarian DNA damage. This is one egregious crime of the technology.\\n\\nThe second reason is the bogus advice that \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the false argument for slow death over quicker death, or the futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can even make things worse. The farther the source, the greater are reflection and refraction of signals, creating a far more chaotic condition for the body to handle. Any telecom/WiFi antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\nReducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usually usage tips but also lower exposure limits. Despite calls for the latter, it holds mostly for heating. For non-heating effects, lower power could even increase the threat, since there\\u2019s a good chance that the closer we get to the minute power levels used by biosystems for intercellular communication, a greater confusion sets in.\\n\\nWith regard to usage tips, \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures accumulate over time to engender serious disease \\u2013 of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem, whose damage these clever warnings for humans worsen.\\n\\nThe problem is that reliance on power level alone to determine safety is largely a convenience (there\\u2019s that fatal word again), not science. The reader doesn\\u2019t need to understand the following terms, just that there are several factors in play, including whether the signal is continuous or pulsed, the shape of the pulsations, the rise time, fall time and duration of the pulsations, the type and depth of modulation, the frequencies, and the bandwidth.\\n\\nTry to set a \\u201csafe\\u201d exposure limit based on all that. So they keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\nA corollary is that folks claiming harm seem to think it\\u2019s for the first time. This is fatal error. There are also stories wherein people or animals affected by, say, a Smart meter, regard symptom abatement when the meter is removed as complete recovery. More fatal error. People have no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway. By now, the reader should know why.\\n\\nAn Idaho organization, ehsidaho.com, collects reports on the incidence and effects of what\\u2019s being called electrohypersensitivity, or EHS. The term is misleading, because no living thing is unaffected by the radiation, whether it manifests outwardly or not. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 is suggested.\\n\\nAn estimated 35% of the population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\nClaire Edwards, a former UN staffer, top writer and wireless activist said to me in an email that an estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. The rest of society is virtually thumbing its nose at these unfortunate people. But they\\u2019ll also suffer if this red flag is ignored: As bad as this sensitivity is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad, either in incidence or severity, as things could quickly and easily get.\\n\\nIllness caused by wireless radiation is not new or unique to it, even though there are lists and categories of issues attributed to it. In medicine, a symptom can be caused by any number of influences, and a single influence can cause various symptoms.\\n\\nSo a big question is, how much of today\\u2019s ongoing ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 that is, defined and named prior to the wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to telecom/WiFi radiation (or even the whole radiation gamut to which we expose ourselves)?\\n\\nIf officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\nThus even for EMF-sick users \\u2014 who are much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors (oblivious) attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\nBut quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 is what must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\nManifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere (see The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026).\\n\\nIf we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\nOf the several historical documents acknowledging the deleterious effects of artificial electromagnetic fields denied by FCC, the definitive one for wireless tech seems to be a 1981 World Health Organization (WHO) report entitled Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973. (I\\u2019ve always thought it unfortunate and instructive that \\u201cenvironmental health\\u201d is not about techno-human torment of Earth, but concern about just payback for the tormentor).\\n\\nThe report is long, covering many aspects. It covers all telecom/WiFi frequencies, including MMW; but real-world harm for the last three decades has come, and continues from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\nAs forthright as the WHO publication purports to be, the Summary reveals a distressing ruthlessness. It\\u2019s all most people need to read to understand that \\u2018they\\u2019 knew. For reader convenience, a brief review follows.\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.3 Biological effects in experimental animals: It has been demonstrated that low-level, long-term exposure may induce effects in the nervous, haematopoietic (production of blood cells and platelets), and immuno-competent cell systems of animals. Such effects have been reported in small animals (rodents) exposed to incident power density levels as low as 0.1-1.0 mW/cm2\\u201d (\\u201cmW\\u201d = milliwatt \\u2013 one thousandth of a watt). So this is one tenth of one thousandth of a watt to one thousandth of a watt per square centimeter. FCC limit: one thousandth of a watt \\u2013 1 mW/cm2 (for frequencies 1500 MHz \\u2013 100 GHz).\\n\\n\\u201cThe reported effects on the nervous system include behavioural, bioelectrical, metabolic, and structural (at the cellular and subcellular levels) changes. Erythrocyte production and haemaglobin synthesis may be impaired and immunological reactivity changed.\\u201d OK so far (except for exploiting/hurting animals).\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.6: Health risk evaluation as a basis for exposure limits: \\u2026 A highly conservative approach would be to keep exposure limits close to natural background levels. However, this is not technically feasible [emphasis added]. A reasonable risk-benefit analysis has to be considered.\\u201d\\n\\nIs \\u201chighly conservative\\u201d a euphemism for \\u201csafe\\u201d? And what does \\u201cclose\\u201d mean? In any case, the \\u201cbackground level,\\u201c called the cosmic background is 0.0000000001 \\u2013 0.000000000000001 \\u00b5W/cm2 (\\u00b5W = microwatt \\u2013 one millionth of a watt). Thus, the higher background limit (first one) is one ten billionth of a millionth of a watt (sounds like just a few electrons to me \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nFCC limit is on the other side of the decimal point at 1000 \\u00b5W/cm2. a thousand millionths of a watt \\u2013 per square centimeter, that is. Frankly, the author\\u2019s head goes into a spin with these minuscule decimals, but it\\u2019s safe to say there\\u2019s a bit of a margin between FCC and Cosmos \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nThe FCC limit is outrageous even compared to the most conservative proposed \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit: .003 \\u2013 .006 \\u00b5W/cm2. and the BioInitiative Report authors say it might even need to be lower..\\n\\nImportantly, however, the cosmic variety is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed). That means there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limit after all: zero.\\n\\n\\u201cNot technically feasible\\u201d? Well, of course. Technology is more important than health in some minds. \\u201cReasonable risk-benefit\\u201d? The Summary doesn\\u2019t say how many sick or dead per million is reasonable. (Please see also)\\n\\nOne wonders if they were aware of earlier studies, referred to by Andrew Michrowski, PhD at the 2009 Toronto Whole Life Expo (see section, Key Testimony in Toronto in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMichrowski interprets the data for us: \\u201cAnalysis of 1950 -1974 mortality of 40,000 Korean War veterans shows that microwave exposure effect is cumulative [emphasis added] it affects all deaths \\u2026 doubling to tripling cancers of eye, brain and central nervous system, lymphatic and hematopoietic [blood-cell/platelet-forming] and digestive systems. This means that even \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures from wireless systems accumulate over the years and decades to engender serious diseases\\u201d (can\\u2019t be said too often).\\n\\nNor do we know if the Warsaw International Symposium or its WHO reviewers were aware that the US military and others conducted microwave stealth-weapon research in the 1950s. This technology became 2G. See Sections Assault: From Weapon to Telecom and Ultimate Atrocity in the Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nOpposition warnings frequently emphasize \\u2018protecting you and your family.\\u2019 The point having been made several times is worth repeating: The most dire threat is to the ecosystem, not humans. No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\nEnvironment usually suffers in the background of hysteria. One will see lists something like this: \\u201chealth, privacy, security, and the environment.\\u201d\\n\\nThose who offer exposure \\u201csolutions\\u201d or \\u201ctips\\u201d seem to forget that no form or amount of human protection does so for Nature. A false sense of security in being \\u201csafer\\u201d leads to continued use and support of the overall system, immeasurably intensifying that threat.\\n\\nInsects, for example, are highly susceptible to telecom/WiFi microwave, especially to MMW, which we haven\\u2019t even had yet. In the last quarter century or so, coinciding closely with the introduction of 2G, 75% of the biomass of insects has disappeared in otherwise protected areas in Germany. Meaning it\\u2019s probably worse where other threats co-exist.\\n\\nEmphatically: The wireless threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. We need to look at the context of wireless, which is technology, per se. And one thing is certain about most of that, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\nIn almost all cases, somewhere along the line from resource acquisition (especially mining) to manufacture, use, and disposal, advanced technology is chemically/energetically toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless encompasses the entire line of a process of Earth liquidation/sacrifice for human \\u201cneeds\\u201d \\u2013 money, convenience, and entertainment (see section The Price of Techno-Civilization in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMoving to \\u201cwired\\u201d telecom/WiFi will not stop this assault. Countries are under siege for resources. Nor will the Elite psyops \\u201cSustainable Development\\u201d and \\u201cClean Renewable Energy\\u201d stop it. But that\\u2019s another article.\\n\\nThe attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed. I ask that anyone who can name a major environmental or health crisis in which technology isn\\u2019t the cause or doesn\\u2019t play a major role, comment about it.\\n\\nLooking at the overall output of \\u201cconcerned\\u201d EMF scientists and activists, however, if one isn\\u2019t careful, one could conclude it\\u2019s thought that humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\nAnother major concern is disproportionate attention on local antennas, while a massive satellite program proceeds. At one point, up to 20,000 satellites were planned to blanket the globe. But the number keeps growing.\\n\\nMadman Elon Musk\\u2019s SpaceX had dibs on 12,000 for 5Gmmw. Here is news that Madman is applying for 30,000 more. Just 42,000 satellites will be about 5 times the total spacecraft launched since 1957 (8,500).\\n\\nSeveral other companies, including Boeing, OneWeb, Amazon, Facebook, not to mention Russia and China, mean many thousands more. Total madness could bring it to somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000. This considered sane. Why? Because insanity unrecognized as such has become the norm in the culture of toxic-technomasturbation.\\n\\nPollution. Some 150 tons of refined kerosene and 340 tons of liquid oxygen per Musk 5G launch (60 satellites, 400 kg each). Do the math, even for 12,000. There seems to be no concern for consequences, such as potential damage to the ozone layer, major interference with earth\\u2019s energy field, or even increased atmospheric CO2 (for the faithful). Not to mention, decline of breathable free oxygen (very cool dynamic graph).\\n\\nMuch seems to be up in the air on the satellite program. Since launches proceed in haste, the plan seems to be shoot them up first, answer proprietary questions later, dismissing anyone else\\u2019s. In Europe, there are currently calls for papers on satellite integration with 5G, with submissions deadline being the Ides of March 2020.\\n\\nNASA, NOAA, meteorologists, (and radio astronomers) have issued valid concerns about MMW. FCC has dismissed them, too. Yet, NASA intends to participate in this bit of insanity.\\n\\nMight such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates? Insane is a good word for it, but psychopathic puts a more specific tag on it. See subsections Same Old Story\\u2026 and \\u2026with a Twist in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nThe best way to beat 5G, on the ground at least, is to quit wireless tech flat. Little demand \\u2018down here\\u2019 could greatly reduce incentive to invest \\u2018up there\\u2019. If there is a total-surveillance and human-control system gestating in the technosphere, how much of a role could satellites play?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strongly suggested that an outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the one on earthbound antennas.\\n\\nTaking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\nAgain, a race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse. Allowing classic 4G (or even just 5G FR1) to continue potentiates imminent disaster. Both scenarios are in progress, but at the \\u2018deniable\\u2019 stage. When \\u2018undeniable\\u2019 sets in, the slope will almost certainly have become too steep and slippery.\\n\\nExperience shows that science-based appeals, to governments at all levels; to national and international regulatory bodies, and so on is an exercise in futility due to multiple factors, including corruption, disbelief, and intimidation. Old and chronic conditions.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s in the People\\u2019s hands now, at the commercial level. Either common sense prevails over addiction and selfishness, or we wait for the race to end and hope it\\u2019s not too late.\\n\\nGive up wireless per se or give up the future \\u2013 liberty first, then life. If not, then welcome all 5G, especially the satellites. Surrender to it will mercifully shorten the coming agony.\\n\\nPeter Tocci is a retired massage therapist and wellness consultant with an abiding interest in exploring \\u2018managed\\u2019 history, nefarious covert agendas, and mainstream/mainstream-alternative news-media dereliction, distortion and suppression.

Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more like hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts. This article attempts to raise some \\u2018dust\\u2019 and clear the air at the same time.\\n\\nBecause carrier rollouts and stories of harm are major opposition concerns, much detail is given to show how \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria makes things worse in various cases. Safety testing, history of official awareness of harm, and opposition priorities are also discussed.\\n\\nTwo Summaries have been published separately for fast-trackers. A Bullet Summary for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose detail, and a Text Summary, for those who want a more general sweep. Both provide means for quickly accessing areas of particular interest. But reading the full text is strongly encouraged. A small number of revisions might not appear in the Summaries.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\nWithout any help from \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers, the \\u201cnext generation\\u201d wireless is very dangerous \\u2014 all by itself \\u2014 as is each previous G by itself. But due to hysteria (illogic, inaccuracies and omissions), most opposition is also dangerous by itself.\\n\\nNot much has changed since this PC Mag article was published in 1/2019. And that doesn\\u2019t cover all critical aspects.\\n\\nConfusion begins right off the bat with the term \\u201c5G.\\u201d It\\u2019s being flung carelessly about, in articles, protests, news reports, corporate bulletins, by politicians \\u2013 even by scientists, and in submissions and comments to official bodies.\\n\\nAlmost always implied when \\u201c5G\\u201d is uttered \\u2013 especially, \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d or \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d \\u2013 is use of the \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This causes misunderstanding and potential danger.\\n\\nOverall, EHF is specified as 30 GHz to 300 GHz, and wavelength 10 millimeters to 1mm respectively. Only a small portion of that range is used in high-frequency 5G operation, and is defined in the US by the FCC as 24 GHz to 90 GHz.\\n\\nAs explained below in 5G Rollouts, for accuracy one must at least distinguish between 1) \\u2018small-cell\\u2019 infrastructure and 5G/small cells per se; 2) between 5G infrastructure and 5G high-frequency radiation; 3) between antennas and their enclosures, and **4) between high frequency 5G and mid-/low-band 5G, the signaling long used for 2G-4G iterations.\\n\\nNew terms are offered here for consistency and for clarifying hysteria-induced misunderstanding and confusion: \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d is a housing for antennas (sending/receiving elements). A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\nOne might see warnings such as: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSmall cell\\u201d is regularly misused, even by the Industry. Accurately speaking, a cell is not an antenna, but the effective area/range of an antenna\\u2019s radiation. 5Gmmw has a short range, which decreases with higher frequency. Thus, its cell is comparatively small.\\n\\nAlso, MMW can easily be blocked, even by even leaves and heavy rain, which deficiency increases with increasing frequency. Both drawbacks can be improved with a substantial power boost, but this also becomes a problem with energy cost and exposure levels, and so is not under consideration. Energy consumption is a major concern for the industry, which is feverishly at work to solve it.\\n\\nShort range and easy \\u2018blockability\\u2019 require more fixture locations, which hysteria frets about, rarely noting the distinction that 5Gmlb makes a large cell and is not blocked. Call it nitpicking if you will, but why not be accurate instead of creating misconception or \\u2018making cases\\u2019?\\n\\n\\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density, and common hysteria about how it will be implemented are in serious question (more later).\\n\\nOne interesting discovery came up while working on this article: Small cells are small but not new, and were not developed for 5G. Small cells have long been deployed in 3G and 4G networks and have become an industry choice to deliver MMW and enable better MLB performance if needed.\\n\\nTraditionally, there have been three types of small cells (more now), identified as they should be by antenna range. Some early deployments were in the US in 2007 and in the UK and Europe in 2009. \\u201cAccording to Small Cell Forum (who would have thought?), 18 million small cells had been deployed globally for various applications by the end of 2016.\\u201d\\n\\nBut haven\\u2019t we been led in a virtually deliberate way from the outset, and even continue to be, to think that 5G is small cells/MMW? Saying \\u201c5G\\u201d to indicate only these two things, or not specifying what you mean, is irresponsible, inaccurate, and misleading, as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nA 10/8/19 bulletin from Project Censored was forwarded to me via an email group that received it from Joel M. Moskowitz, PhD, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at UC Berkeley. A typically careless statement consisting of an error and a question mark says, \\u201cThe telecom industry is promoting the replacement of the current cellular network, known as 4G, with a new generation of higher frequency 5G wavelengths to power the \\u201cInternet of Things\\u2026\\u201d As a generalization, this is either shameful unawareness of the current scenario or untruth/propaganda, as we\\u2019ll also see.\\n\\n5G opposition also asserts that the skin\\u2019s (spiral) sweat ducts act as \\u201creceiving antennas.\\u201d This refers to an Israeli study, \\u201cThe human skin as a sub-THz receiver \\u2013 Does 5G pose a danger to it or not?\\u201d\\n\\nFrequency ranges don\\u2019t transition abruptly, but sub-THz usually means a range of 300 GHz down to 90, which is the upper end of FCC 5Gmmw.\\n\\nThe study Abstract uses two unquantified terms, \\u201csub-terahertz band\\u201d and \\u201csub-THz region.\\u201d I think \\u201cregion\\u201d is more accurate, meaning the range, or \\u201cspectrum\\u201d as understood in tech circles. \\u201cBand\\u201d is used to designate a single frequency, but also is an interval between a lower and upper frequency. For instance, a transmission between 40 and 50 MHz is a 10 MHz band (width).\\n\\nStudy frequencies were 75 GHz to 110 GHz. No wireless provider I\\u2019m aware of (in the US) has announced a mobile 5Gmmw service anywhere near 75 GHz. There was no explanation in the Abstract why announced commercial frequencies were not used.\\n\\nPower-level exposure limits at the user end are expressed in watts per area, usually square meter or square centimeter. No such levels are provided for the targets used, but maybe that\\u2019s not relevant in this case.\\n\\nThe highest commercial frequency I could find being tested is in the UK (though also approved for US), is 60 GHz. At least one rural test area is reportedly using a 60 GHz \\u201cwireless mesh\\u201d (interior network of interacting antennas) for \\u2018super WiFi.\\u2019 Not for mobile and still not up to 75 GHz.\\n\\nInteresting is that other UK rural testbeds are running unused TV bands called \\u201cTV white space\\u201d \\u2014 the old VHF to UHF frequencies, mostly MHz bands. This is 5G, mind you.\\n\\nHowever, bandwidths 71 to 76 GHz, 81 to 86 GHz and 92 to 95 GHz are available in the US for \\u201chigh-density\\u201d (high power) \\u201cfixed wireless access\\u201d services: \\u201c\\u2026the operation of wireless communication devices or systems used to connect two fixed locations (e.g., building to building or tower to building) with a radio or other wireless link\\u2026\\u201d, which would have to be line-of-sight and are not for mobile.\\n\\nAs noted, the higher the frequency, the greater are transmission challenges, so high-density bands would be very tight beams, with minimal to no obstacles and no human exposure (watch out, pigeons). Due to excess electricity consumption, MMW signals probably won\\u2019t be power boosted sufficiently to penetrate buildings, but be brought in via cable from an external receiver, then be distributed via a wireless network.\\n\\nStudy conclusion: \\u201cWe are raising a warning flag against the unrestricted use of sub-THz technologies for communication, before the possible consequences for public health are explored.\\u201d This seems sane enough \\u2013 within the insane context called wireless telecom/WiFi. See Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (needs updating).\\n\\nBut \\u201cunrestricted\\u201d at least suggests the impossible, that restrictions could prevent all trouble. Note also \\u201cpossible consequences.\\u201d This can\\u2019t be valid for harm in general, which is a fact long understood \\u2013 almost three decades before 2G came out (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\nWhen this warning is given, we don\\u2019t hear that the \\u201cwarning flag\\u201d would apply conceptually to all G\\u2019s; presumes there is a safe dose of MLB somewhere; and, as usual, neglects the ecosystem. But \\u2014 enough for protesters to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas? Making cases? I confess I fell for this one in my early research on wireless. A more likely, but still speculative, concern is discussed in Reports of \\u201c5G\\u201d Harm.\\n\\nAnother common warning, \\u201c5G is a weapon,\\u201d usually refers to the military\\u2019s Active Denial System, a \\u201cnon-lethal\\u201d microwave device for dispersing crowds by heating the skin. It\\u2019s a high density (power) millimeter wave at 95 GHz \\u2013 hardly commercial 5Gmmw.\\n\\nMMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G. Wireless telecom, beginning with 2G, is adapted stealth-weapon technology which uses very low power. The entire wireless system, not just \\u201c5G\\u201d, is a potential weapon on various levels (more below).\\n\\nAlso, high-enough density microwave \\u2014 at a \\u2018lowly\\u2019 2.5 GHz, for example \\u2014 will cook you like a microwave oven (2.45 GHz). That is, through and through, unlike ADS. At commercial power levels, 5Gmmw will not.\\n\\nA powerful Air Force radar system called Pave Paws at three US locations will cook you in a nanosecond at 420 to 450 MHz. Installations have two large circular arrays of antenna elements, each array radiating 580 kilowatts (!) It can detect a basketball at 12 miles, and small planes caught in the beam have blown up. So don\\u2019t swallow the rhetoric about telecom MMW weaponry.\\n\\nI was unable to find a range of ADS power output, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study calling out 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2) at 94 GHz (see Reports of Harm). ADS power is adjustable, however, enough to be used as a lethal weapon. But \\u2013 \\u2018making cases\\u2019 again?\\n\\nMicrowave ovens operate from 600 to 1200 watts. By comparison, maximum output of traditional cell towers is 10 watts \\u2013 phones, 2 watts. The higher frequency/shorter wavelength was chosen for ADS to limit penetration depth. Not saying that\\u2019s a good thing, not to mention it\\u2019s misleading (see Reports of Harm).\\n\\nFinding a wattage output figure for new, 5G MLB or MMW antennas proved fruitlessly time consuming (anyone?), but I did find a study establishing a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for a particular 5Gmmw antenna design for 28 and 38 GHz.\\n\\nSAR is an expression of how much radiation from a phone is absorbed over time by the body. It\\u2019s expressed in watts per kilogram (W/kg). Values were \\u201c\\u20260.37 and 1.34 W/kg [up to] 2 W/kg. Current FCC SAR standard is 1.6W/kg. This is given just for a sense of comparison, because SAR is useless for determining the amount of radiofrequency (RF) absorption in biosystems during typical conditions of use. See Safety Testing below.\\n\\nMany opposers suggest that 3G/4G/WiFi can be made reasonably safe. Others understand that impossibility, but seem too habituated and addicted to do the right thing. As noted in the Introduction, techno-humans are adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\n\\u201cNo \\u20185G\\u2019 safety studies have been conducted or funded by the Federal Communications Commission or the telecom industry, and none is planned.\\u201d Or simply, \\u201c5G has not been tested for safety\\u201d. Or the like. No such claims provide the facts.\\n\\nThat the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d terror, whereas, the real terror is wireless tech per se. Inherent in this ploy is the erroneous implication that 2G-4G were tested (a yes and no proposition).\\n\\nIn 1996, FCC adopted the standard identified as ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992. There were \\u2018window dressings\\u2019 in 2004, 2005, and 2010, and, like the original, covered frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019. (Overall \\u2018microwave\\u2019 is considered to be 300 MHz (.3 GHz) to 300 GHz.\\n\\nThe Commission\\u2019s assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is based on the fraudulent IEEE \\u2018testing\\u2019 it adopted in 1996 to run interference for 3G. That is, if the radiation doesn\\u2019t heat you, it can\\u2019t harm you.\\n\\nThis author warned of this response by FCC in February 2019 as \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria was powering up: Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised? Exposure limits worldwide are based on the ANSI/IEEE C95.1 fraud.\\n\\nPeer reviewed independent science, as early as the 1950s and still going, demonstrating myriad effects at non-heating levels, brings the integrity of C95.1-1992 through 2019 into question. Was *proper* testing ever done? Instead of clarifying this, hysteria makes the blanket claim. Making cases.\\n\\nThe FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science and such questions: \\u2018No convincing evidence exists, but we\\u2019re keeping an eye on it.\\u2019 The blatant criminality of the FCC with respect to wireless/EMF is clearly demonstrated by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nHysteria often resorts to another \\u2018ploy on words\\u2019 pertaining to 2G-4G, and used even by scientists, as seen near the end of this report: \\u201cThe current FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d The word implies that standards were at one time valid or sufficient, when they were never any such thing, for any living thing.\\n\\n\\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing has been demonstrated or can exist. Despite this, new limits are proposed and stubbornly called for \\u2014 in spite of the consensus that no safe level has even been published for fetuses.\\n\\nApparently, that\\u2019s not of sufficient concern to call for \\u201cStop Wireless Technology!\\u201d instead of \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d We\\u2019ll figure that fetus part out later.\\n\\nFor details on the original \\u2018safety\\u2019 testing \\u2013 scientific fraud, that is, on which power-level exposure limits worldwide are based \\u2013 see Sections Cell Phone Output and Exposure Limits for Users in the article Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\nMajor emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA,\\u2019 due to the short range and easy block-ability of MMW. But things seem to be developing differently for now, as we\\u2019ll see. As noted, even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\nThe following synthesis is the result of wading through too many articles to give credit to any one. Some sources tell varying stories about the same thing, and even disagree with each other considerably.\\n\\nSo here goes: A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard has been issued, specifying two frequency ranges: 5G NR bands FR1 & 5G NR bands FR2. Number one is for current bands below 6 GHz (5Gmlb), such as 600MHz, 1900MHz, and 2.5GHz; two is for MMW \\u2014 mostly 24 to 40 GHz for mobile, and higher for special applications (not mobile). In the near term, public WiFi will remain separate at MLB, 2.45 GHz and 5 GHz, but Verizon, for example, is offering 5Gmmw home internet/WiFi (not mobile) in limited areas of four cities.\\n\\n5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention at this point, including especially \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and \\u2018beamforming\\u2019 (more later).\\n\\nHowever, 5G NR FR1 can use the same towers as 4G, but will need new antennas. It has the same reach and penetration, but with shorter delay, while providing up to 35 percent more speed. The wireless addict\\u2019s dream. When you think about it, FR1 should really be 5G, and 5Gmmw, 6G.\\n\\nPlans are also in place for deployments using the unlicensed, Citizens Broadband Radio Service 3.5 GHz band, and all key players really want in. This is MLB called 5G, mind you.\\n\\nThings get a bit stickier when it comes to needing a new phone or not. Many current phones should be able to get updates to process FR1, but a new phone is needed for FR2. Generally, the \\u201ctech\\u201d advice is not to move yet, and here\\u2019s an example with Samsung\\u2019s $1300 5G Galaxy S10 being tested in Chicago (good shot of a 5Gmmw \\u201cnode\\u201d here).\\n\\nThe \\u201chold off\\u201d sentiment is conveyed also in this article. What it amounts to at this writing is that 5Gmmw is virtually at a \\u201cdemo\\u201d stage, not full coverage and service, even in town.\\n\\nMany \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers continue to use traditional 3G/4G/WiFi wireless, either knowing the danger or believing it\\u2019s safe, or will be, because they just want it. A possible motive driving hysteria?\\n\\nAnother possible motive for \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, or maybe just the effect it\\u2019s having, is to create a threat on the ground to draw resistance and to distract attention from the satellite program, a much more sinister development (see Examining Priorities below).\\n\\nThe disconnect about dangers brings up a story that drew wide attention at the time, especially in the UK, and one that seems to present a puzzle. It\\u2019s about the 6/26 2019 Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, Somerset County, England. It\\u2019s not strictly a \\u201crollout\\u201d story, more a system demo/test, but a decision was announced about installing \\u201c5G\\u201d network towers on festival grounds,\\n\\nDespite the fact that \\u201cGlastonbury officials [said] that move will allow festival attendees to access the Internet on their smartphones at faster speeds,\\u201d the announcement created a huge protest. In this story, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G are mentioned, but \\u201c5G\\u201d is not specified as MLB or MMW \\u2014 as anything, in other words. Is this hysteria-induced negligence?\\n\\nThe protest article is laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated one that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d. Even some much-admired professional associates/contacts promote this irresponsible notion. I must respectfully, but strongly, disagree, because the erroneous implication is that 2G-4G were/are not an experiment. Paradoxically, they were/are and were/are not experiments. Distinctions must be made (more below).\\n\\nConfusion again: \\u201cWhile obviously not many festival-goers are likely to have a \\u20185G\\u2019 phone by June, EE will be showing off what the network can do at its stand.\\u201d Once again, unspecified 5G. So, was the Glastonbury demo about 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb? Whatever, tickets sold out in less than 45 minutes.\\n\\nThe grand protest by potential attendees was both tragic and macabrely amusing: They were prepared to irradiate themselves constantly in huge numbers (up to 200,000 fans in attendance potentially using phones/smartphones), but fretted over \\u201c5G\\u201d, not even knowing it could have been their beloved 4G poison\\u2026reborn. Phone radiation is often overlooked.\\n\\nSimilarly, reports on the 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland clearly reflect the confusion and negligent use of \\u201c5G.\\u201d This Agence France-Presse story says, \\u201cBy early July, 334 antennae (sic) stations for 5G were operational across the country, authorities have told AFP.\\u201d Boy, watch out for authorities.\\n\\nAntenna location and density info aren\\u2019t revealed, but it could be urban or \\u2018near-urban.\\u2019 The number doesn\\u2019t seem to correspond to FLD in neighborhoods, but who knows, thanks to incomplete reporting (and perhaps misled authorities). The news reader is therefore in the dark about exactly what\\u2019s going on, but probably assumes it\\u2019s MMW. Due to\\u2026 \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s (but beginning much earlier). What was known then was later hushed in the runup to digital mobile telecom in 1991-2.\\n\\nThe decision was callously made long ago to put life/people at risk to have the technology (see History of Official Awareness below). Thus, the yes/no \\u201cexperiment\\u201d is not whether there will be harm from telecom/WiFi microwave, but the time window in which ongoing exposure damage \\u2014 across all frequencies and regardless of power level \\u2014 will manifest in a cascade of widespread intractable illness.\\n\\nNot to worry, though, that fate might be avoided: Ecosystem collapse could bring the house down beforehand. You might hear/see, \\u201cThe 5G race is on,\\u201d meaning market competition. The race of note, though, is between ecosystem collapse and human-health collapse.\\n\\nIn any case, here\\u2019s some of what\\u2019s happening in \\u2018real\\u2019 life. The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon. Carriers are choosing service areas for FR1, FR2 very carefully.\\n\\nT-Mobile has announced a nationwide 5Gmlb rollout at 600 MHz and an undisclosed application of \\u201c28 and 39\\u201d (see video), which means some 5Gmmw, almost certainly in cities.\\n\\nSprint\\u2019s plans are to run \\u201cLTE and 5G\\u201d simultaneously in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\nMentioned earlier, Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d (allegedly MMW \\u2013 5Gmmw) is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range to cover wide area\\u201d (5Gmlb), doesn\\u2019t say where.\\n\\nSacramento seems to be the most enthusiastic victim host for wireless. Here\\u2019s a gushing PR piece about a Verizon UWB installation at one Sacramento citizen\\u2019s home, with City officials attending. It features an external receiver. Sacramento also prides itself on opening the floodgates for \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more later).\\n\\nVerizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas, which could be its final destination. Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason. Ecocidal, terminally pathological 3G/4G still rages, again reflecting the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nThe forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. As noted earlier, drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for \\u201c18 million new\\u201d closely spaced fixtures nationwide. Given the above information on FR1 rollouts, there seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\nA report on new Qualcomm smartphone antennas supports the foregoing. It covers four bands between 26.5GHz and 40 GHz, but also antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 The QPM56xx RF module family works with the Snapdragon X50 modem to work in the sub-6GHz bands\\u2026\\u201d (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\nOne puzzle: It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) as specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs seem to disagree, saying 4G can handle IoT. Propaganda? Careless chatter? Who knows. It\\u2019s safe to assume, however, they refer to the new 4G/5Gmlb.\\n\\nSome opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. And the attempted widespread deployment of smart utility meters on 4G WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say. 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, because if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\nI didn\\u2019t bother spending the rest of my life trying to find if/where FLD installations are occurring. Anyone who\\u2019s seen close installations in any area, please share details in Comments.\\n\\nNow, if FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose. One, possibility of course, is optimized 5Gmlb performance, as in the past, although this shouldn\\u2019t often be necessary, due to the large cell and penetration of MLB.\\n\\nIn the entrained, FLD frame of mind, I was suspicious in Wireless Technology: \\u2026 (The 5G Locomotive section) of Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams\\u2019 statement in a 5/15/18 CNBC interview that antennas in your face is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019d say he was being coy, implying MLB, and being careful not to depict 5G accurately, since 5Gmmw must have increased FLD, while 5Gmlb, not for the most part.\\n\\nMcAdam touted 5Gmmw for smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality, all good reasons for planetary and health destruction. But remember, all the \\u201cSmart\\u201d out there now is WiFi, for which there is no 5Gmmw (although Verizon\\u2019s UWB Home Internet might qualify). \\u201cSmart\\u201d is the wireless tech word for monumentally stupid \\u2014 and for total surveillance and centralized coordination and control of daily life. See section The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026.\\n\\nNone of the above means things can\\u2019t change. It\\u2019s early. The MLB rollout could be just a prelude to an FLD/MMW invasion. If MMW gets a toe-hold and no one\\u2019s coming up provably sick, and people like it, it could weaken opposition and open floodgates.\\n\\nAnd there\\u2019s the question of how the many thousands of planned satellites (looking now like well more than 50,000) fit into the overall picture. Obviously, coverage comes immediately to mind, such as saturation in outlying areas? For IoT? One issue for satellites, though, is increased delay time (\\u201clatency\\u201d) due to distance. There could be a \\u2018division of labor\\u2019 among various services, such as ground for mobile and sats for entertainment.\\n\\nNote the promise of the nationwide sySTEMic programming to make kids into corporate plug-ins or hitech drones: \\u201cSTEM education emphasizes the value of a rigorous, interdisciplinary approach to education, allowing students to compete and succeed in a modern global marketplace.\\u201d How many dubious assumptions, claims and buzzwords in that PR flak?\\n\\nSTEM promises a wondrous, prosperous, techno-shiny future. It exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. In the developed world, the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum total of the latter. Speaking of which, once a city is immersed in \\u201csmart\\u201d tech, it\\u2019s likely to become a special target of hackers. Imagine the potential chaos.)\\n\\nThere have been various reports of adverse effects when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, almost certainly implying 5Gmmw. This would seem unlikely, virtually impossible, outside cities/populous areas.\\n\\nApparently, people see new infrastructure dense or not, or/and feel effects, and apparently assume MMW is in use, as we saw in the Bern example.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d harm stories consistently report symptoms existing before anyone even heard of 5G. Long before. All reported harms I\\u2019ve seen are classic 2G-4G symptoms, and mostly of the \\u2018Electrohypersensitivity\\u2019 type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\nRadiation/RF-level meters have been used to support claims. But RF meters don\\u2019t display frequencies, only power level within a range of frequencies. Ordinary meters, costing from around $120 to $400, top out at 8 GHz. 3G/4G mobile frequencies range from 600 megahertz to 2.5 GHz in the US, with 3.5 GHz coming. WiFi is 2.4 and 5 GHz. Recall, FCC defines 5Gmmw as 24 GHz to 90 GHz. Thus, current meters can\\u2019t read MMW.\\n\\nA true 5G phone would identify MMW (and MLB at this point). Professional (very expensive) meters cover low and high ranges into the upper GHz (I found one 10 MHz to 220 GHz), but also don\\u2019t display frequencies, so all frequencies present still couldn\\u2019t be identified.\\n\\nLong-term exposure, perhaps a cumulative effect, is playing into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Thus, if there is harm when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, what\\u2019s shown by existing meters? Not understood by victims and reporters? 4G, one way or another. Hysteria-induced confusion.\\n\\nOne hawker claims its meter can read \\u201c5G\\u201d based on the fact that two new MLB frequencies are used for 5G (mlb). Any old meter does this. This ruse brought to you by \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nMeters are interesting, but not really helpful for most people. Radiation is everywhere; no amount of exposure is safe; most bio-effects below heating are power-independent; and effects may be cumulative (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nA meter might come in handy for someone with outward symptoms and using some form of shielding, for example. It could be seen at what level symptoms abate \\u2013 which doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops. Most likely, it\\u2019s palliation, but it can still save much grief and help people function.\\n\\nWe can come to cautious conclusion about the frequency present by type of effect. Known effects of MMW (a limited volume of science, though growing) differ from MLB effects long reported in the voluminous dismissed science.\\n\\nMMW potentially threatens skin and eyes, but more effects are being reported, although sometimes \\u2018stretched.\\u2019 For example, a paper cited (in an article by a prominent scientist who must remain anonymous) to show that 5Gmmw impacts \\u201cheart rate variability\\u201d was a military directed-energy study (see Author Information) using 94 GHz at 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2). That\\u2019s essentially the \\u201cADS\\u201d system noted earlier.\\n\\nNot only is 75 mW 75 times the main FCC limit (limits vary with frequency), but 94 is a frequency higher than the upper limit of 5Gmmw defined by the FCC, and certainly wouldn\\u2019t be used in mobile applications. Making cases?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not that MMW can\\u2019t create MLB effects, but it\\u2019s a bit speculative at this point. It\\u2019s possible, however \\u201c\\u2026since nerves, blood vessels and other electrically conducting structures can carry radiation-induced currents deep into the body\\u201d (see section 5G is qualitatively and quantitatively different from 4G)\\n\\nAntenna technology called MIMO (pron. my-mo) has been around for about a decade now for MLB. The more recent development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, meaning many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming (and receiving) beams of radiation. It looks to be destined for both FR1 and FR2 (a virtual necessity for MMW). As noted, Sprint will use this at for 5G at 3.5 GHz.\\n\\nOne question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose an additional threat. It\\u2019s possible they have an effect different from traditional antennas. Also, it seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of many focused beams, although being immersed in a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\nIn any case, aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying a beam from point to point (line of sight) avoids high power output per beam, since penetration of intervening structures isn\\u2019t required.\\n\\nHysteria often warns of outrageously high power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d As noted, effects occur at all levels below heating, which is why 3G/4G need to go. And it would not behoove the industry for people to suddenly be suffering heat damage.\\n\\nDetails of several typical news reports follow. Most demonstrate the fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one shows a more general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\nThe story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from a Verizon antenna installed near the home illustrates confusion. The first video on this page shows testimony before the Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with the mayor present.\\n\\nThe type of antenna isn\\u2019t given. But it\\u2019s probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. We learned from the \\u201cgushing PR piece\\u201d cited in the 5G Rollouts section that Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strange that the testimony date precedes the stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests prior to the grand \\u201cunveiling,\\u201d so it could have been an early \\u201cHome\\u201d antenna. Or maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\nThe opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that ambiguous statement mean to the person who wrote it? To the viewer? The incident suggests harm (cold/flu symptoms) from 5Gmmw but still reinforces the importance of knowing what we mean when we say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\nThe mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although her prepared speech commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but the suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness, even though levels \\u201care still very high\\u201d will certainly be taken officially as \\u201ccorrelation,\\u201d not proof or even evidence.\\n\\nTypically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\nBottom line: Which 5G is present is academic, since the pre-\\u201c5G\\u201d endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal. Focus on \\u201c5G\\u201d is like fretting about a wildfire 10 miles away while your house is burning down.\\n\\nOne of the more outrageous opposition-induced hysterias in recent times is a story from Gateshead, a town in northern UK near the North Sea, that new LED street lights (no microwave fixtures on them, just the lights) were emitting \\u201c5G\\u201d and causing health issues. This was carelessly picked up by other outlets. No one gave a moment\\u2019s thought to the likelihood that it might be LED lights themselves.\\n\\nA news report from Cincinnati clearly demonstrates that folks are in the dark about what 5G is, thanks to hysteria. And a fairly well-known one from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, to its credit, shows a better general awareness of wireless threat. But both demonstrate questionable thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make them safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem).\\n\\nScroll down this page to see an RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story. Regardless of one\\u2019s opinion of RT, this one\\u2019s a great and accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\nThe original story from 9/20/19 (now includes an update) is a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria,\\u201d since no one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers up to this point. It involves a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that \\u201cpeople fear\\u201d will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d.\\n\\nThe 9/27/19 update shows a video interview with a concerned nurse, a conditioned \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacking understanding of the wireless threat. She\\u2019ll feel safer if that nasty tall tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\nThe tall, new-look tower with the cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video) is clearly not the massive MIMO 5Gmmw/small-cell type shown in the 5G-phone report in the 5G Rollouts section. That was Verizon\\u2019s.\\n\\nThe update also says the tower is Sprint\\u2019s. As noted, Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using massive MIMO. It being a Sprint tower, it\\u2019s not MMW. The \\u201c5G\\u201d fear was an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\nSo what\\u2019s in the cylindrical fixture? Could be 4G (LTE), 5Gmlb (\\u201c5G\\u201d), WiFi as well? WiMax? One question \\u2013 is it MIMO? Massive? Anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\nThe update notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are also popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman David Weissmann confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what? From what we\\u2019ve seen of Verizon, probably 5Gmlb, i.e., 4G LTE on FR1 steroids.\\n\\nThe San Joaquin report, from 3/12/19 also concerns a tall tower with a cylindrical fixture. But this isn\\u2019t about 5G, but about \\u201ca cell tower\\u201d being too close to an elementary school in Ripon with a \\u2018cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\n\\u201cAll in all, three teachers and four students have been battling various cancers since 2016,\\u201d as well as a 22-year-old former male student. Of course, those teachers and that young man \\u2018never\\u2019 used a wireless device, and never near that tower. Nor were they exposed to another tower or anyone else\\u2019s phone. This doesn\\u2019t seem to dawn on people.\\n\\nThe Ripon case is interesting. An independent expert was consulted, who contradicted official assurance that the tower tested within federal standards. He said he wouldn\\u2019t send his kids there, because kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed \\u2013 as if they\\u2019re not exposed 24/7 anywhere a phone/tower system is working, not only from towers, but many phones as well. And does he think that once you\\u2019re \\u201cdeveloped\\u201d it\\u2019s OK?\\n\\nSprint subsequently shut it down and agreed to relocate, guilty or not. The move was good PR, and indicates that companies and municipalities will back down \\u2013 probably to avoid litigation, since that could open floodgates.\\n\\nRipon is important for two more reasons. The first is the usually overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure (see History of Official Awareness below). It\\u2019s well known, for example, that effects from cigarette tobacco and ionizing radiation (like a hospital X-ray), are cumulative. There\\u2019s no reason wireless radiation should be any different.\\n\\nMost kids are heavily exposed in our wireless world, wherever they are \\u2013 many from conception, and even before that, especially to ovarian DNA damage. This is one egregious crime of the technology.\\n\\nThe second reason is the bogus advice that \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the false argument for slow death over quicker death, or the futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can even make things worse. The farther the source, the greater are reflection and refraction of signals, creating a far more chaotic condition for the body to handle. Any telecom/WiFi antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\nReducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usually usage tips but also lower exposure limits. Despite calls for the latter, it holds mostly for heating. For non-heating effects, lower power could even increase the threat, since there\\u2019s a good chance that the closer we get to the minute power levels used by biosystems for intercellular communication, a greater confusion sets in.\\n\\nWith regard to usage tips, \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures accumulate over time to engender serious disease \\u2013 of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem, whose damage these clever warnings for humans worsen.\\n\\nThe problem is that reliance on power level alone to determine safety is largely a convenience (there\\u2019s that fatal word again), not science. The reader doesn\\u2019t need to understand the following terms, just that there are several factors in play, including whether the signal is continuous or pulsed, the shape of the pulsations, the rise time, fall time and duration of the pulsations, the type and depth of modulation, the frequencies, and the bandwidth.\\n\\nTry to set a \\u201csafe\\u201d exposure limit based on all that. So they keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\nA corollary is that folks claiming harm seem to think it\\u2019s for the first time. This is fatal error. There are also stories wherein people or animals affected by, say, a Smart meter, regard symptom abatement when the meter is removed as complete recovery. More fatal error. People have no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway. By now, the reader should know why.\\n\\nAn Idaho organization, ehsidaho.com, collects reports on the incidence and effects of what\\u2019s being called electrohypersensitivity, or EHS. The term is misleading, because no living thing is unaffected by the radiation, whether it manifests outwardly or not. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 is suggested.\\n\\nAn estimated 35% of the population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\nClaire Edwards, a former UN staffer, top writer and wireless activist said to me in an email that an estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. The rest of society is virtually thumbing its nose at these unfortunate people. But they\\u2019ll also suffer if this red flag is ignored: As bad as this sensitivity is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad, either in incidence or severity, as things could quickly and easily get.\\n\\nIllness caused by wireless radiation is not new or unique to it, even though there are lists and categories of issues attributed to it. In medicine, a symptom can be caused by any number of influences, and a single influence can cause various symptoms.\\n\\nSo a big question is, how much of today\\u2019s ongoing ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 that is, defined and named prior to the wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to telecom/WiFi radiation (or even the whole radiation gamut to which we expose ourselves)?\\n\\nIf officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\nThus even for EMF-sick users \\u2014 who are much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors (oblivious) attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\nBut quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 is what must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\nManifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere (see The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026).\\n\\nIf we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\nOf the several historical documents acknowledging the deleterious effects of artificial electromagnetic fields denied by FCC, the definitive one for wireless tech seems to be a 1981 World Health Organization (WHO) report entitled Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973. (I\\u2019ve always thought it unfortunate and instructive that \\u201cenvironmental health\\u201d is not about techno-human torment of Earth, but concern about just payback for the tormentor).\\n\\nThe report is long, covering many aspects. It covers all telecom/WiFi frequencies, including MMW; but real-world harm for the last three decades has come, and continues from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\nAs forthright as the WHO publication purports to be, the Summary reveals a distressing ruthlessness. It\\u2019s all most people need to read to understand that \\u2018they\\u2019 knew. For reader convenience, a brief review follows.\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.3 Biological effects in experimental animals: It has been demonstrated that low-level, long-term exposure may induce effects in the nervous, haematopoietic (production of blood cells and platelets), and immuno-competent cell systems of animals. Such effects have been reported in small animals (rodents) exposed to incident power density levels as low as 0.1-1.0 mW/cm2\\u201d (\\u201cmW\\u201d = milliwatt \\u2013 one thousandth of a watt). So this is one tenth of one thousandth of a watt to one thousandth of a watt per square centimeter. FCC limit: one thousandth of a watt \\u2013 1 mW/cm2 (for frequencies 1500 MHz \\u2013 100 GHz).\\n\\n\\u201cThe reported effects on the nervous system include behavioural, bioelectrical, metabolic, and structural (at the cellular and subcellular levels) changes. Erythrocyte production and haemaglobin synthesis may be impaired and immunological reactivity changed.\\u201d OK so far (except for exploiting/hurting animals).\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.6: Health risk evaluation as a basis for exposure limits: \\u2026 A highly conservative approach would be to keep exposure limits close to natural background levels. However, this is not technically feasible [emphasis added]. A reasonable risk-benefit analysis has to be considered.\\u201d\\n\\nIs \\u201chighly conservative\\u201d a euphemism for \\u201csafe\\u201d? And what does \\u201cclose\\u201d mean? In any case, the \\u201cbackground level,\\u201c called the cosmic background is 0.0000000001 \\u2013 0.000000000000001 \\u00b5W/cm2 (\\u00b5W = microwatt \\u2013 one millionth of a watt). Thus, the higher background limit (first one) is one ten billionth of a millionth of a watt (sounds like just a few electrons to me \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nFCC limit is on the other side of the decimal point at 1000 \\u00b5W/cm2. a thousand millionths of a watt \\u2013 per square centimeter, that is. Frankly, the author\\u2019s head goes into a spin with these minuscule decimals, but it\\u2019s safe to say there\\u2019s a bit of a margin between FCC and Cosmos \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nThe FCC limit is outrageous even compared to the most conservative proposed \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit: .003 \\u2013 .006 \\u00b5W/cm2. and the BioInitiative Report authors say it might even need to be lower..\\n\\nImportantly, however, the cosmic variety is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed). That means there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limit after all: zero.\\n\\n\\u201cNot technically feasible\\u201d? Well, of course. Technology is more important than health in some minds. \\u201cReasonable risk-benefit\\u201d? The Summary doesn\\u2019t say how many sick or dead per million is reasonable. (Please see also)\\n\\nOne wonders if they were aware of earlier studies, referred to by Andrew Michrowski, PhD at the 2009 Toronto Whole Life Expo (see section, Key Testimony in Toronto in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMichrowski interprets the data for us: \\u201cAnalysis of 1950 -1974 mortality of 40,000 Korean War veterans shows that microwave exposure effect is cumulative [emphasis added] it affects all deaths \\u2026 doubling to tripling cancers of eye, brain and central nervous system, lymphatic and hematopoietic [blood-cell/platelet-forming] and digestive systems. This means that even \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures from wireless systems accumulate over the years and decades to engender serious diseases\\u201d (can\\u2019t be said too often).\\n\\nNor do we know if the Warsaw International Symposium or its WHO reviewers were aware that the US military and others conducted microwave stealth-weapon research in the 1950s. This technology became 2G. See Sections Assault: From Weapon to Telecom and Ultimate Atrocity in the Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nOpposition warnings frequently emphasize \\u2018protecting you and your family.\\u2019 The point having been made several times is worth repeating: The most dire threat is to the ecosystem, not humans. No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\nEnvironment usually suffers in the background of hysteria. One will see lists something like this: \\u201chealth, privacy, security, and the environment.\\u201d\\n\\nThose who offer exposure \\u201csolutions\\u201d or \\u201ctips\\u201d seem to forget that no form or amount of human protection does so for Nature. A false sense of security in being \\u201csafer\\u201d leads to continued use and support of the overall system, immeasurably intensifying that threat.\\n\\nInsects, for example, are highly susceptible to telecom/WiFi microwave, especially to MMW, which we haven\\u2019t even had yet. In the last quarter century or so, coinciding closely with the introduction of 2G, 75% of the biomass of insects has disappeared in otherwise protected areas in Germany. Meaning it\\u2019s probably worse where other threats co-exist.\\n\\nEmphatically: The wireless threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. We need to look at the context of wireless, which is technology, per se. And one thing is certain about most of that, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\nIn almost all cases, somewhere along the line from resource acquisition (especially mining) to manufacture, use, and disposal, advanced technology is chemically/energetically toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless encompasses the entire line of a process of Earth liquidation/sacrifice for human \\u201cneeds\\u201d \\u2013 money, convenience, and entertainment (see section The Price of Techno-Civilization in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMoving to \\u201cwired\\u201d telecom/WiFi will not stop this assault. Countries are under siege for resources. Nor will the Elite psyops \\u201cSustainable Development\\u201d and \\u201cClean Renewable Energy\\u201d stop it. But that\\u2019s another article.\\n\\nThe attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed. I ask that anyone who can name a major environmental or health crisis in which technology isn\\u2019t the cause or doesn\\u2019t play a major role, comment about it.\\n\\nLooking at the overall output of \\u201cconcerned\\u201d EMF scientists and activists, however, if one isn\\u2019t careful, one could conclude it\\u2019s thought that humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\nAnother major concern is disproportionate attention on local antennas, while a massive satellite program proceeds. At one point, up to 20,000 satellites were planned to blanket the globe. But the number keeps growing.\\n\\nMadman Elon Musk\\u2019s SpaceX had dibs on 12,000 for 5Gmmw. Here is news that Madman is applying for 30,000 more. Just 42,000 satellites will be about 5 times the total spacecraft launched since 1957 (8,500).\\n\\nSeveral other companies, including Boeing, OneWeb, Amazon, Facebook, not to mention Russia and China, mean many thousands more. Total madness could bring it to somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000. This considered sane. Why? Because insanity unrecognized as such has become the norm in the culture of toxic-technomasturbation.\\n\\nPollution. Some 150 tons of refined kerosene and 340 tons of liquid oxygen per Musk 5G launch (60 satellites, 400 kg each). Do the math, even for 12,000. There seems to be no concern for consequences, such as potential damage to the ozone layer, major interference with earth\\u2019s energy field, or even increased atmospheric CO2 (for the faithful). Not to mention, decline of breathable free oxygen (very cool dynamic graph).\\n\\nMuch seems to be up in the air on the satellite program. Since launches proceed in haste, the plan seems to be shoot them up first, answer proprietary questions later, dismissing anyone else\\u2019s. In Europe, there are currently calls for papers on satellite integration with 5G, with submissions deadline being the Ides of March 2020.\\n\\nNASA, NOAA, meteorologists, (and radio astronomers) have issued valid concerns about MMW. FCC has dismissed them, too. Yet, NASA intends to participate in this bit of insanity.\\n\\nMight such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates? Insane is a good word for it, but psychopathic puts a more specific tag on it. See subsections Same Old Story\\u2026 and \\u2026with a Twist in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nThe best way to beat 5G, on the ground at least, is to quit wireless tech flat. Little demand \\u2018down here\\u2019 could greatly reduce incentive to invest \\u2018up there\\u2019. If there is a total-surveillance and human-control system gestating in the technosphere, how much of a role could satellites play?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strongly suggested that an outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the one on earthbound antennas.\\n\\nTaking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\nAgain, a race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse. Allowing classic 4G (or even just 5G FR1) to continue potentiates imminent disaster. Both scenarios are in progress, but at the \\u2018deniable\\u2019 stage. When \\u2018undeniable\\u2019 sets in, the slope will almost certainly have become too steep and slippery.\\n\\nExperience shows that science-based appeals, to governments at all levels; to national and international regulatory bodies, and so on is an exercise in futility due to multiple factors, including corruption, disbelief, and intimidation. Old and chronic conditions.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s in the People\\u2019s hands now, at the commercial level. Either common sense prevails over addiction and selfishness, or we wait for the race to end and hope it\\u2019s not too late.\\n\\nGive up wireless per se or give up the future \\u2013 liberty first, then life. If not, then welcome all 5G, especially the satellites. Surrender to it will mercifully shorten the coming agony.\\n\\nPeter Tocci is a retired massage therapist and wellness consultant with an abiding interest in exploring \\u2018managed\\u2019 history, nefarious covert agendas, and mainstream/mainstream-alternative news-media dereliction, distortion and suppression.

Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more like hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts.

Safety testing, history of official awareness of harm, and opposition priorities are also discussed.\\n\\nTwo Summaries have been published separately for fast-trackers. A Bullet Summary for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose detail, and a Text Summary, for those who want a more general sweep. Both provide means for quickly accessing areas of particular interest. But reading the full text is strongly encouraged. A small number of revisions might not appear in the Summaries.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\nWithout any help from \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers, the \\u201cnext generation\\u201d wireless is very dangerous \\u2014 all by itself \\u2014 as is each previous G by itself. But due to hysteria (illogic, inaccuracies and omissions), most opposition is also dangerous by itself.\\n\\nNot much has changed since this PC Mag article was published in 1/2019. And that doesn\\u2019t cover all critical aspects.\\n\\nConfusion begins right off the bat with the term \\u201c5G.\\u201d It\\u2019s being flung carelessly about, in articles, protests, news reports, corporate bulletins, by politicians \\u2013 even by scientists, and in submissions and comments to official bodies.\\n\\nAlmost always implied when \\u201c5G\\u201d is uttered \\u2013 especially, \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d or \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d \\u2013 is use of the \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This causes misunderstanding and potential danger.\\n\\nOverall, EHF is specified as 30 GHz to 300 GHz, and wavelength 10 millimeters to 1mm respectively. Only a small portion of that range is used in high-frequency 5G operation, and is defined in the US by the FCC as 24 GHz to 90 GHz.\\n\\nAs explained below in 5G Rollouts, for accuracy one must at least distinguish between 1) \\u2018small-cell\\u2019 infrastructure and 5G/small cells per se; 2) between 5G infrastructure and 5G high-frequency radiation; 3) between antennas and their enclosures, and **4) between high frequency 5G and mid-/low-band 5G, the signaling long used for 2G-4G iterations.\\n\\nNew terms are offered here for consistency and for clarifying hysteria-induced misunderstanding and confusion: \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d is a housing for antennas (sending/receiving elements). A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\nOne might see warnings such as: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSmall cell\\u201d is regularly misused, even by the Industry. Accurately speaking, a cell is not an antenna, but the effective area/range of an antenna\\u2019s radiation. 5Gmmw has a short range, which decreases with higher frequency. Thus, its cell is comparatively small.\\n\\nAlso, MMW can easily be blocked, even by even leaves and heavy rain, which deficiency increases with increasing frequency. Both drawbacks can be improved with a substantial power boost, but this also becomes a problem with energy cost and exposure levels, and so is not under consideration. Energy consumption is a major concern for the industry, which is feverishly at work to solve it.\\n\\nShort range and easy \\u2018blockability\\u2019 require more fixture locations, which hysteria frets about, rarely noting the distinction that 5Gmlb makes a large cell and is not blocked. Call it nitpicking if you will, but why not be accurate instead of creating misconception or \\u2018making cases\\u2019?\\n\\n\\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density, and common hysteria about how it will be implemented are in serious question (more later).\\n\\nOne interesting discovery came up while working on this article: Small cells are small but not new, and were not developed for 5G. Small cells have long been deployed in 3G and 4G networks and have become an industry choice to deliver MMW and enable better MLB performance if needed.\\n\\nTraditionally, there have been three types of small cells (more now), identified as they should be by antenna range. Some early deployments were in the US in 2007 and in the UK and Europe in 2009. \\u201cAccording to Small Cell Forum (who would have thought?), 18 million small cells had been deployed globally for various applications by the end of 2016.\\u201d\\n\\nBut haven\\u2019t we been led in a virtually deliberate way from the outset, and even continue to be, to think that 5G is small cells/MMW? Saying \\u201c5G\\u201d to indicate only these two things, or not specifying what you mean, is irresponsible, inaccurate, and misleading, as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nA 10/8/19 bulletin from Project Censored was forwarded to me via an email group that received it from Joel M. Moskowitz, PhD, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at UC Berkeley. A typically careless statement consisting of an error and a question mark says, \\u201cThe telecom industry is promoting the replacement of the current cellular network, known as 4G, with a new generation of higher frequency 5G wavelengths to power the \\u201cInternet of Things\\u2026\\u201d As a generalization, this is either shameful unawareness of the current scenario or untruth/propaganda, as we\\u2019ll also see.\\n\\n5G opposition also asserts that the skin\\u2019s (spiral) sweat ducts act as \\u201creceiving antennas.\\u201d This refers to an Israeli study, \\u201cThe human skin as a sub-THz receiver \\u2013 Does 5G pose a danger to it or not?\\u201d\\n\\nFrequency ranges don\\u2019t transition abruptly, but sub-THz usually means a range of 300 GHz down to 90, which is the upper end of FCC 5Gmmw.\\n\\nThe study Abstract uses two unquantified terms, \\u201csub-terahertz band\\u201d and \\u201csub-THz region.\\u201d I think \\u201cregion\\u201d is more accurate, meaning the range, or \\u201cspectrum\\u201d as understood in tech circles. \\u201cBand\\u201d is used to designate a single frequency, but also is an interval between a lower and upper frequency. For instance, a transmission between 40 and 50 MHz is a 10 MHz band (width).\\n\\nStudy frequencies were 75 GHz to 110 GHz. No wireless provider I\\u2019m aware of (in the US) has announced a mobile 5Gmmw service anywhere near 75 GHz. There was no explanation in the Abstract why announced commercial frequencies were not used.\\n\\nPower-level exposure limits at the user end are expressed in watts per area, usually square meter or square centimeter. No such levels are provided for the targets used, but maybe that\\u2019s not relevant in this case.\\n\\nThe highest commercial frequency I could find being tested is in the UK (though also approved for US), is 60 GHz. At least one rural test area is reportedly using a 60 GHz \\u201cwireless mesh\\u201d (interior network of interacting antennas) for \\u2018super WiFi.\\u2019 Not for mobile and still not up to 75 GHz.\\n\\nInteresting is that other UK rural testbeds are running unused TV bands called \\u201cTV white space\\u201d \\u2014 the old VHF to UHF frequencies, mostly MHz bands. This is 5G, mind you.\\n\\nHowever, bandwidths 71 to 76 GHz, 81 to 86 GHz and 92 to 95 GHz are available in the US for \\u201chigh-density\\u201d (high power) \\u201cfixed wireless access\\u201d services: \\u201c\\u2026the operation of wireless communication devices or systems used to connect two fixed locations (e.g., building to building or tower to building) with a radio or other wireless link\\u2026\\u201d, which would have to be line-of-sight and are not for mobile.\\n\\nAs noted, the higher the frequency, the greater are transmission challenges, so high-density bands would be very tight beams, with minimal to no obstacles and no human exposure (watch out, pigeons). Due to excess electricity consumption, MMW signals probably won\\u2019t be power boosted sufficiently to penetrate buildings, but be brought in via cable from an external receiver, then be distributed via a wireless network.\\n\\nStudy conclusion: \\u201cWe are raising a warning flag against the unrestricted use of sub-THz technologies for communication, before the possible consequences for public health are explored.\\u201d This seems sane enough \\u2013 within the insane context called wireless telecom/WiFi. See Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (needs updating).\\n\\nBut \\u201cunrestricted\\u201d at least suggests the impossible, that restrictions could prevent all trouble. Note also \\u201cpossible consequences.\\u201d This can\\u2019t be valid for harm in general, which is a fact long understood \\u2013 almost three decades before 2G came out (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\nWhen this warning is given, we don\\u2019t hear that the \\u201cwarning flag\\u201d would apply conceptually to all G\\u2019s; presumes there is a safe dose of MLB somewhere; and, as usual, neglects the ecosystem. But \\u2014 enough for protesters to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas? Making cases? I confess I fell for this one in my early research on wireless. A more likely, but still speculative, concern is discussed in Reports of \\u201c5G\\u201d Harm.\\n\\nAnother common warning, \\u201c5G is a weapon,\\u201d usually refers to the military\\u2019s Active Denial System, a \\u201cnon-lethal\\u201d microwave device for dispersing crowds by heating the skin. It\\u2019s a high density (power) millimeter wave at 95 GHz \\u2013 hardly commercial 5Gmmw.\\n\\nMMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G. Wireless telecom, beginning with 2G, is adapted stealth-weapon technology which uses very low power. The entire wireless system, not just \\u201c5G\\u201d, is a potential weapon on various levels (more below).\\n\\nAlso, high-enough density microwave \\u2014 at a \\u2018lowly\\u2019 2.5 GHz, for example \\u2014 will cook you like a microwave oven (2.45 GHz). That is, through and through, unlike ADS. At commercial power levels, 5Gmmw will not.\\n\\nA powerful Air Force radar system called Pave Paws at three US locations will cook you in a nanosecond at 420 to 450 MHz. Installations have two large circular arrays of antenna elements, each array radiating 580 kilowatts (!) It can detect a basketball at 12 miles, and small planes caught in the beam have blown up. So don\\u2019t swallow the rhetoric about telecom MMW weaponry.\\n\\nI was unable to find a range of ADS power output, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study calling out 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2) at 94 GHz (see Reports of Harm). ADS power is adjustable, however, enough to be used as a lethal weapon. But \\u2013 \\u2018making cases\\u2019 again?\\n\\nMicrowave ovens operate from 600 to 1200 watts. By comparison, maximum output of traditional cell towers is 10 watts \\u2013 phones, 2 watts. The higher frequency/shorter wavelength was chosen for ADS to limit penetration depth. Not saying that\\u2019s a good thing, not to mention it\\u2019s misleading (see Reports of Harm).\\n\\nFinding a wattage output figure for new, 5G MLB or MMW antennas proved fruitlessly time consuming (anyone?), but I did find a study establishing a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for a particular 5Gmmw antenna design for 28 and 38 GHz.\\n\\nSAR is an expression of how much radiation from a phone is absorbed over time by the body. It\\u2019s expressed in watts per kilogram (W/kg). Values were \\u201c\\u20260.37 and 1.34 W/kg [up to] 2 W/kg. Current FCC SAR standard is 1.6W/kg. This is given just for a sense of comparison, because SAR is useless for determining the amount of radiofrequency (RF) absorption in biosystems during typical conditions of use. See Safety Testing below.\\n\\nMany opposers suggest that 3G/4G/WiFi can be made reasonably safe. Others understand that impossibility, but seem too habituated and addicted to do the right thing. As noted in the Introduction, techno-humans are adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\n\\u201cNo \\u20185G\\u2019 safety studies have been conducted or funded by the Federal Communications Commission or the telecom industry, and none is planned.\\u201d Or simply, \\u201c5G has not been tested for safety\\u201d. Or the like. No such claims provide the facts.\\n\\nThat the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d terror, whereas, the real terror is wireless tech per se. Inherent in this ploy is the erroneous implication that 2G-4G were tested (a yes and no proposition).\\n\\nIn 1996, FCC adopted the standard identified as ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992. There were \\u2018window dressings\\u2019 in 2004, 2005, and 2010, and, like the original, covered frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019. (Overall \\u2018microwave\\u2019 is considered to be 300 MHz (.3 GHz) to 300 GHz.\\n\\nThe Commission\\u2019s assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is based on the fraudulent IEEE \\u2018testing\\u2019 it adopted in 1996 to run interference for 3G. That is, if the radiation doesn\\u2019t heat you, it can\\u2019t harm you.\\n\\nThis author warned of this response by FCC in February 2019 as \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria was powering up: Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised? Exposure limits worldwide are based on the ANSI/IEEE C95.1 fraud.\\n\\nPeer reviewed independent science, as early as the 1950s and still going, demonstrating myriad effects at non-heating levels, brings the integrity of C95.1-1992 through 2019 into question. Was *proper* testing ever done? Instead of clarifying this, hysteria makes the blanket claim. Making cases.\\n\\nThe FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science and such questions: \\u2018No convincing evidence exists, but we\\u2019re keeping an eye on it.\\u2019 The blatant criminality of the FCC with respect to wireless/EMF is clearly demonstrated by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nHysteria often resorts to another \\u2018ploy on words\\u2019 pertaining to 2G-4G, and used even by scientists, as seen near the end of this report: \\u201cThe current FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d The word implies that standards were at one time valid or sufficient, when they were never any such thing, for any living thing.\\n\\n\\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing has been demonstrated or can exist. Despite this, new limits are proposed and stubbornly called for \\u2014 in spite of the consensus that no safe level has even been published for fetuses.\\n\\nApparently, that\\u2019s not of sufficient concern to call for \\u201cStop Wireless Technology!\\u201d instead of \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d We\\u2019ll figure that fetus part out later.\\n\\nFor details on the original \\u2018safety\\u2019 testing \\u2013 scientific fraud, that is, on which power-level exposure limits worldwide are based \\u2013 see Sections Cell Phone Output and Exposure Limits for Users in the article Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\nMajor emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA,\\u2019 due to the short range and easy block-ability of MMW. But things seem to be developing differently for now, as we\\u2019ll see. As noted, even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\nThe following synthesis is the result of wading through too many articles to give credit to any one. Some sources tell varying stories about the same thing, and even disagree with each other considerably.\\n\\nSo here goes: A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard has been issued, specifying two frequency ranges: 5G NR bands FR1 & 5G NR bands FR2. Number one is for current bands below 6 GHz (5Gmlb), such as 600MHz, 1900MHz, and 2.5GHz; two is for MMW \\u2014 mostly 24 to 40 GHz for mobile, and higher for special applications (not mobile). In the near term, public WiFi will remain separate at MLB, 2.45 GHz and 5 GHz, but Verizon, for example, is offering 5Gmmw home internet/WiFi (not mobile) in limited areas of four cities.\\n\\n5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention at this point, including especially \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and \\u2018beamforming\\u2019 (more later).\\n\\nHowever, 5G NR FR1 can use the same towers as 4G, but will need new antennas. It has the same reach and penetration, but with shorter delay, while providing up to 35 percent more speed. The wireless addict\\u2019s dream. When you think about it, FR1 should really be 5G, and 5Gmmw, 6G.\\n\\nPlans are also in place for deployments using the unlicensed, Citizens Broadband Radio Service 3.5 GHz band, and all key players really want in. This is MLB called 5G, mind you.\\n\\nThings get a bit stickier when it comes to needing a new phone or not. Many current phones should be able to get updates to process FR1, but a new phone is needed for FR2. Generally, the \\u201ctech\\u201d advice is not to move yet, and here\\u2019s an example with Samsung\\u2019s $1300 5G Galaxy S10 being tested in Chicago (good shot of a 5Gmmw \\u201cnode\\u201d here).\\n\\nThe \\u201chold off\\u201d sentiment is conveyed also in this article. What it amounts to at this writing is that 5Gmmw is virtually at a \\u201cdemo\\u201d stage, not full coverage and service, even in town.\\n\\nMany \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers continue to use traditional 3G/4G/WiFi wireless, either knowing the danger or believing it\\u2019s safe, or will be, because they just want it. A possible motive driving hysteria?\\n\\nAnother possible motive for \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, or maybe just the effect it\\u2019s having, is to create a threat on the ground to draw resistance and to distract attention from the satellite program, a much more sinister development (see Examining Priorities below).\\n\\nThe disconnect about dangers brings up a story that drew wide attention at the time, especially in the UK, and one that seems to present a puzzle. It\\u2019s about the 6/26 2019 Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, Somerset County, England. It\\u2019s not strictly a \\u201crollout\\u201d story, more a system demo/test, but a decision was announced about installing \\u201c5G\\u201d network towers on festival grounds,\\n\\nDespite the fact that \\u201cGlastonbury officials [said] that move will allow festival attendees to access the Internet on their smartphones at faster speeds,\\u201d the announcement created a huge protest. In this story, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G are mentioned, but \\u201c5G\\u201d is not specified as MLB or MMW \\u2014 as anything, in other words. Is this hysteria-induced negligence?\\n\\nThe protest article is laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated one that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d. Even some much-admired professional associates/contacts promote this irresponsible notion. I must respectfully, but strongly, disagree, because the erroneous implication is that 2G-4G were/are not an experiment. Paradoxically, they were/are and were/are not experiments. Distinctions must be made (more below).\\n\\nConfusion again: \\u201cWhile obviously not many festival-goers are likely to have a \\u20185G\\u2019 phone by June, EE will be showing off what the network can do at its stand.\\u201d Once again, unspecified 5G. So, was the Glastonbury demo about 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb? Whatever, tickets sold out in less than 45 minutes.\\n\\nThe grand protest by potential attendees was both tragic and macabrely amusing: They were prepared to irradiate themselves constantly in huge numbers (up to 200,000 fans in attendance potentially using phones/smartphones), but fretted over \\u201c5G\\u201d, not even knowing it could have been their beloved 4G poison\\u2026reborn. Phone radiation is often overlooked.\\n\\nSimilarly, reports on the 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland clearly reflect the confusion and negligent use of \\u201c5G.\\u201d This Agence France-Presse story says, \\u201cBy early July, 334 antennae (sic) stations for 5G were operational across the country, authorities have told AFP.\\u201d Boy, watch out for authorities.\\n\\nAntenna location and density info aren\\u2019t revealed, but it could be urban or \\u2018near-urban.\\u2019 The number doesn\\u2019t seem to correspond to FLD in neighborhoods, but who knows, thanks to incomplete reporting (and perhaps misled authorities). The news reader is therefore in the dark about exactly what\\u2019s going on, but probably assumes it\\u2019s MMW. Due to\\u2026 \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s (but beginning much earlier). What was known then was later hushed in the runup to digital mobile telecom in 1991-2.\\n\\nThe decision was callously made long ago to put life/people at risk to have the technology (see History of Official Awareness below). Thus, the yes/no \\u201cexperiment\\u201d is not whether there will be harm from telecom/WiFi microwave, but the time window in which ongoing exposure damage \\u2014 across all frequencies and regardless of power level \\u2014 will manifest in a cascade of widespread intractable illness.\\n\\nNot to worry, though, that fate might be avoided: Ecosystem collapse could bring the house down beforehand. You might hear/see, \\u201cThe 5G race is on,\\u201d meaning market competition. The race of note, though, is between ecosystem collapse and human-health collapse.\\n\\nIn any case, here\\u2019s some of what\\u2019s happening in \\u2018real\\u2019 life. The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon. Carriers are choosing service areas for FR1, FR2 very carefully.\\n\\nT-Mobile has announced a nationwide 5Gmlb rollout at 600 MHz and an undisclosed application of \\u201c28 and 39\\u201d (see video), which means some 5Gmmw, almost certainly in cities.\\n\\nSprint\\u2019s plans are to run \\u201cLTE and 5G\\u201d simultaneously in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\nMentioned earlier, Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d (allegedly MMW \\u2013 5Gmmw) is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range to cover wide area\\u201d (5Gmlb), doesn\\u2019t say where.\\n\\nSacramento seems to be the most enthusiastic victim host for wireless. Here\\u2019s a gushing PR piece about a Verizon UWB installation at one Sacramento citizen\\u2019s home, with City officials attending. It features an external receiver. Sacramento also prides itself on opening the floodgates for \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more later).\\n\\nVerizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas, which could be its final destination. Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason. Ecocidal, terminally pathological 3G/4G still rages, again reflecting the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nThe forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. As noted earlier, drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for \\u201c18 million new\\u201d closely spaced fixtures nationwide. Given the above information on FR1 rollouts, there seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\nA report on new Qualcomm smartphone antennas supports the foregoing. It covers four bands between 26.5GHz and 40 GHz, but also antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 The QPM56xx RF module family works with the Snapdragon X50 modem to work in the sub-6GHz bands\\u2026\\u201d (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\nOne puzzle: It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) as specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs seem to disagree, saying 4G can handle IoT. Propaganda? Careless chatter? Who knows. It\\u2019s safe to assume, however, they refer to the new 4G/5Gmlb.\\n\\nSome opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. And the attempted widespread deployment of smart utility meters on 4G WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say. 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, because if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\nI didn\\u2019t bother spending the rest of my life trying to find if/where FLD installations are occurring. Anyone who\\u2019s seen close installations in any area, please share details in Comments.\\n\\nNow, if FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose. One, possibility of course, is optimized 5Gmlb performance, as in the past, although this shouldn\\u2019t often be necessary, due to the large cell and penetration of MLB.\\n\\nIn the entrained, FLD frame of mind, I was suspicious in Wireless Technology: \\u2026 (The 5G Locomotive section) of Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams\\u2019 statement in a 5/15/18 CNBC interview that antennas in your face is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019d say he was being coy, implying MLB, and being careful not to depict 5G accurately, since 5Gmmw must have increased FLD, while 5Gmlb, not for the most part.\\n\\nMcAdam touted 5Gmmw for smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality, all good reasons for planetary and health destruction. But remember, all the \\u201cSmart\\u201d out there now is WiFi, for which there is no 5Gmmw (although Verizon\\u2019s UWB Home Internet might qualify). \\u201cSmart\\u201d is the wireless tech word for monumentally stupid \\u2014 and for total surveillance and centralized coordination and control of daily life. See section The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026.\\n\\nNone of the above means things can\\u2019t change. It\\u2019s early. The MLB rollout could be just a prelude to an FLD/MMW invasion. If MMW gets a toe-hold and no one\\u2019s coming up provably sick, and people like it, it could weaken opposition and open floodgates.\\n\\nAnd there\\u2019s the question of how the many thousands of planned satellites (looking now like well more than 50,000) fit into the overall picture. Obviously, coverage comes immediately to mind, such as saturation in outlying areas? For IoT? One issue for satellites, though, is increased delay time (\\u201clatency\\u201d) due to distance. There could be a \\u2018division of labor\\u2019 among various services, such as ground for mobile and sats for entertainment.\\n\\nNote the promise of the nationwide sySTEMic programming to make kids into corporate plug-ins or hitech drones: \\u201cSTEM education emphasizes the value of a rigorous, interdisciplinary approach to education, allowing students to compete and succeed in a modern global marketplace.\\u201d How many dubious assumptions, claims and buzzwords in that PR flak?\\n\\nSTEM promises a wondrous, prosperous, techno-shiny future. It exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. In the developed world, the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum total of the latter. Speaking of which, once a city is immersed in \\u201csmart\\u201d tech, it\\u2019s likely to become a special target of hackers. Imagine the potential chaos.)\\n\\nThere have been various reports of adverse effects when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, almost certainly implying 5Gmmw. This would seem unlikely, virtually impossible, outside cities/populous areas.\\n\\nApparently, people see new infrastructure dense or not, or/and feel effects, and apparently assume MMW is in use, as we saw in the Bern example.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d harm stories consistently report symptoms existing before anyone even heard of 5G. Long before. All reported harms I\\u2019ve seen are classic 2G-4G symptoms, and mostly of the \\u2018Electrohypersensitivity\\u2019 type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\nRadiation/RF-level meters have been used to support claims. But RF meters don\\u2019t display frequencies, only power level within a range of frequencies. Ordinary meters, costing from around $120 to $400, top out at 8 GHz. 3G/4G mobile frequencies range from 600 megahertz to 2.5 GHz in the US, with 3.5 GHz coming. WiFi is 2.4 and 5 GHz. Recall, FCC defines 5Gmmw as 24 GHz to 90 GHz. Thus, current meters can\\u2019t read MMW.\\n\\nA true 5G phone would identify MMW (and MLB at this point). Professional (very expensive) meters cover low and high ranges into the upper GHz (I found one 10 MHz to 220 GHz), but also don\\u2019t display frequencies, so all frequencies present still couldn\\u2019t be identified.\\n\\nLong-term exposure, perhaps a cumulative effect, is playing into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Thus, if there is harm when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, what\\u2019s shown by existing meters? Not understood by victims and reporters? 4G, one way or another. Hysteria-induced confusion.\\n\\nOne hawker claims its meter can read \\u201c5G\\u201d based on the fact that two new MLB frequencies are used for 5G (mlb). Any old meter does this. This ruse brought to you by \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nMeters are interesting, but not really helpful for most people. Radiation is everywhere; no amount of exposure is safe; most bio-effects below heating are power-independent; and effects may be cumulative (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nA meter might come in handy for someone with outward symptoms and using some form of shielding, for example. It could be seen at what level symptoms abate \\u2013 which doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops. Most likely, it\\u2019s palliation, but it can still save much grief and help people function.\\n\\nWe can come to cautious conclusion about the frequency present by type of effect. Known effects of MMW (a limited volume of science, though growing) differ from MLB effects long reported in the voluminous dismissed science.\\n\\nMMW potentially threatens skin and eyes, but more effects are being reported, although sometimes \\u2018stretched.\\u2019 For example, a paper cited (in an article by a prominent scientist who must remain anonymous) to show that 5Gmmw impacts \\u201cheart rate variability\\u201d was a military directed-energy study (see Author Information) using 94 GHz at 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2). That\\u2019s essentially the \\u201cADS\\u201d system noted earlier.\\n\\nNot only is 75 mW 75 times the main FCC limit (limits vary with frequency), but 94 is a frequency higher than the upper limit of 5Gmmw defined by the FCC, and certainly wouldn\\u2019t be used in mobile applications. Making cases?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not that MMW can\\u2019t create MLB effects, but it\\u2019s a bit speculative at this point. It\\u2019s possible, however \\u201c\\u2026since nerves, blood vessels and other electrically conducting structures can carry radiation-induced currents deep into the body\\u201d (see section 5G is qualitatively and quantitatively different from 4G)\\n\\nAntenna technology called MIMO (pron. my-mo) has been around for about a decade now for MLB. The more recent development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, meaning many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming (and receiving) beams of radiation. It looks to be destined for both FR1 and FR2 (a virtual necessity for MMW). As noted, Sprint will use this at for 5G at 3.5 GHz.\\n\\nOne question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose an additional threat. It\\u2019s possible they have an effect different from traditional antennas. Also, it seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of many focused beams, although being immersed in a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\nIn any case, aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying a beam from point to point (line of sight) avoids high power output per beam, since penetration of intervening structures isn\\u2019t required.\\n\\nHysteria often warns of outrageously high power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d As noted, effects occur at all levels below heating, which is why 3G/4G need to go. And it would not behoove the industry for people to suddenly be suffering heat damage.\\n\\nDetails of several typical news reports follow. Most demonstrate the fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one shows a more general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\nThe story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from a Verizon antenna installed near the home illustrates confusion. The first video on this page shows testimony before the Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with the mayor present.\\n\\nThe type of antenna isn\\u2019t given. But it\\u2019s probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. We learned from the \\u201cgushing PR piece\\u201d cited in the 5G Rollouts section that Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strange that the testimony date precedes the stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests prior to the grand \\u201cunveiling,\\u201d so it could have been an early \\u201cHome\\u201d antenna. Or maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\nThe opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that ambiguous statement mean to the person who wrote it? To the viewer? The incident suggests harm (cold/flu symptoms) from 5Gmmw but still reinforces the importance of knowing what we mean when we say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\nThe mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although her prepared speech commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but the suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness, even though levels \\u201care still very high\\u201d will certainly be taken officially as \\u201ccorrelation,\\u201d not proof or even evidence.\\n\\nTypically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\nBottom line: Which 5G is present is academic, since the pre-\\u201c5G\\u201d endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal. Focus on \\u201c5G\\u201d is like fretting about a wildfire 10 miles away while your house is burning down.\\n\\nOne of the more outrageous opposition-induced hysterias in recent times is a story from Gateshead, a town in northern UK near the North Sea, that new LED street lights (no microwave fixtures on them, just the lights) were emitting \\u201c5G\\u201d and causing health issues. This was carelessly picked up by other outlets. No one gave a moment\\u2019s thought to the likelihood that it might be LED lights themselves.\\n\\nA news report from Cincinnati clearly demonstrates that folks are in the dark about what 5G is, thanks to hysteria. And a fairly well-known one from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, to its credit, shows a better general awareness of wireless threat. But both demonstrate questionable thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make them safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem).\\n\\nScroll down this page to see an RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story. Regardless of one\\u2019s opinion of RT, this one\\u2019s a great and accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\nThe original story from 9/20/19 (now includes an update) is a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria,\\u201d since no one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers up to this point. It involves a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that \\u201cpeople fear\\u201d will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d.\\n\\nThe 9/27/19 update shows a video interview with a concerned nurse, a conditioned \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacking understanding of the wireless threat. She\\u2019ll feel safer if that nasty tall tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\nThe tall, new-look tower with the cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video) is clearly not the massive MIMO 5Gmmw/small-cell type shown in the 5G-phone report in the 5G Rollouts section. That was Verizon\\u2019s.\\n\\nThe update also says the tower is Sprint\\u2019s. As noted, Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using massive MIMO. It being a Sprint tower, it\\u2019s not MMW. The \\u201c5G\\u201d fear was an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\nSo what\\u2019s in the cylindrical fixture? Could be 4G (LTE), 5Gmlb (\\u201c5G\\u201d), WiFi as well? WiMax? One question \\u2013 is it MIMO? Massive? Anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\nThe update notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are also popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman David Weissmann confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what? From what we\\u2019ve seen of Verizon, probably 5Gmlb, i.e., 4G LTE on FR1 steroids.\\n\\nThe San Joaquin report, from 3/12/19 also concerns a tall tower with a cylindrical fixture. But this isn\\u2019t about 5G, but about \\u201ca cell tower\\u201d being too close to an elementary school in Ripon with a \\u2018cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\n\\u201cAll in all, three teachers and four students have been battling various cancers since 2016,\\u201d as well as a 22-year-old former male student. Of course, those teachers and that young man \\u2018never\\u2019 used a wireless device, and never near that tower. Nor were they exposed to another tower or anyone else\\u2019s phone. This doesn\\u2019t seem to dawn on people.\\n\\nThe Ripon case is interesting. An independent expert was consulted, who contradicted official assurance that the tower tested within federal standards. He said he wouldn\\u2019t send his kids there, because kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed \\u2013 as if they\\u2019re not exposed 24/7 anywhere a phone/tower system is working, not only from towers, but many phones as well. And does he think that once you\\u2019re \\u201cdeveloped\\u201d it\\u2019s OK?\\n\\nSprint subsequently shut it down and agreed to relocate, guilty or not. The move was good PR, and indicates that companies and municipalities will back down \\u2013 probably to avoid litigation, since that could open floodgates.\\n\\nRipon is important for two more reasons. The first is the usually overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure (see History of Official Awareness below). It\\u2019s well known, for example, that effects from cigarette tobacco and ionizing radiation (like a hospital X-ray), are cumulative. There\\u2019s no reason wireless radiation should be any different.\\n\\nMost kids are heavily exposed in our wireless world, wherever they are \\u2013 many from conception, and even before that, especially to ovarian DNA damage. This is one egregious crime of the technology.\\n\\nThe second reason is the bogus advice that \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the false argument for slow death over quicker death, or the futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can even make things worse. The farther the source, the greater are reflection and refraction of signals, creating a far more chaotic condition for the body to handle. Any telecom/WiFi antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\nReducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usually usage tips but also lower exposure limits. Despite calls for the latter, it holds mostly for heating. For non-heating effects, lower power could even increase the threat, since there\\u2019s a good chance that the closer we get to the minute power levels used by biosystems for intercellular communication, a greater confusion sets in.\\n\\nWith regard to usage tips, \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures accumulate over time to engender serious disease \\u2013 of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem, whose damage these clever warnings for humans worsen.\\n\\nThe problem is that reliance on power level alone to determine safety is largely a convenience (there\\u2019s that fatal word again), not science. The reader doesn\\u2019t need to understand the following terms, just that there are several factors in play, including whether the signal is continuous or pulsed, the shape of the pulsations, the rise time, fall time and duration of the pulsations, the type and depth of modulation, the frequencies, and the bandwidth.\\n\\nTry to set a \\u201csafe\\u201d exposure limit based on all that. So they keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\nA corollary is that folks claiming harm seem to think it\\u2019s for the first time. This is fatal error. There are also stories wherein people or animals affected by, say, a Smart meter, regard symptom abatement when the meter is removed as complete recovery. More fatal error. People have no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway. By now, the reader should know why.\\n\\nAn Idaho organization, ehsidaho.com, collects reports on the incidence and effects of what\\u2019s being called electrohypersensitivity, or EHS. The term is misleading, because no living thing is unaffected by the radiation, whether it manifests outwardly or not. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 is suggested.\\n\\nAn estimated 35% of the population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\nClaire Edwards, a former UN staffer, top writer and wireless activist said to me in an email that an estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. The rest of society is virtually thumbing its nose at these unfortunate people. But they\\u2019ll also suffer if this red flag is ignored: As bad as this sensitivity is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad, either in incidence or severity, as things could quickly and easily get.\\n\\nIllness caused by wireless radiation is not new or unique to it, even though there are lists and categories of issues attributed to it. In medicine, a symptom can be caused by any number of influences, and a single influence can cause various symptoms.\\n\\nSo a big question is, how much of today\\u2019s ongoing ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 that is, defined and named prior to the wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to telecom/WiFi radiation (or even the whole radiation gamut to which we expose ourselves)?\\n\\nIf officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\nThus even for EMF-sick users \\u2014 who are much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors (oblivious) attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\nBut quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 is what must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\nManifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere (see The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026).\\n\\nIf we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\nOf the several historical documents acknowledging the deleterious effects of artificial electromagnetic fields denied by FCC, the definitive one for wireless tech seems to be a 1981 World Health Organization (WHO) report entitled Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973. (I\\u2019ve always thought it unfortunate and instructive that \\u201cenvironmental health\\u201d is not about techno-human torment of Earth, but concern about just payback for the tormentor).\\n\\nThe report is long, covering many aspects. It covers all telecom/WiFi frequencies, including MMW; but real-world harm for the last three decades has come, and continues from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\nAs forthright as the WHO publication purports to be, the Summary reveals a distressing ruthlessness. It\\u2019s all most people need to read to understand that \\u2018they\\u2019 knew. For reader convenience, a brief review follows.\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.3 Biological effects in experimental animals: It has been demonstrated that low-level, long-term exposure may induce effects in the nervous, haematopoietic (production of blood cells and platelets), and immuno-competent cell systems of animals. Such effects have been reported in small animals (rodents) exposed to incident power density levels as low as 0.1-1.0 mW/cm2\\u201d (\\u201cmW\\u201d = milliwatt \\u2013 one thousandth of a watt). So this is one tenth of one thousandth of a watt to one thousandth of a watt per square centimeter. FCC limit: one thousandth of a watt \\u2013 1 mW/cm2 (for frequencies 1500 MHz \\u2013 100 GHz).\\n\\n\\u201cThe reported effects on the nervous system include behavioural, bioelectrical, metabolic, and structural (at the cellular and subcellular levels) changes. Erythrocyte production and haemaglobin synthesis may be impaired and immunological reactivity changed.\\u201d OK so far (except for exploiting/hurting animals).\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.6: Health risk evaluation as a basis for exposure limits: \\u2026 A highly conservative approach would be to keep exposure limits close to natural background levels. However, this is not technically feasible [emphasis added]. A reasonable risk-benefit analysis has to be considered.\\u201d\\n\\nIs \\u201chighly conservative\\u201d a euphemism for \\u201csafe\\u201d? And what does \\u201cclose\\u201d mean? In any case, the \\u201cbackground level,\\u201c called the cosmic background is 0.0000000001 \\u2013 0.000000000000001 \\u00b5W/cm2 (\\u00b5W = microwatt \\u2013 one millionth of a watt). Thus, the higher background limit (first one) is one ten billionth of a millionth of a watt (sounds like just a few electrons to me \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nFCC limit is on the other side of the decimal point at 1000 \\u00b5W/cm2. a thousand millionths of a watt \\u2013 per square centimeter, that is. Frankly, the author\\u2019s head goes into a spin with these minuscule decimals, but it\\u2019s safe to say there\\u2019s a bit of a margin between FCC and Cosmos \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nThe FCC limit is outrageous even compared to the most conservative proposed \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit: .003 \\u2013 .006 \\u00b5W/cm2. and the BioInitiative Report authors say it might even need to be lower..\\n\\nImportantly, however, the cosmic variety is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed). That means there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limit after all: zero.\\n\\n\\u201cNot technically feasible\\u201d? Well, of course. Technology is more important than health in some minds. \\u201cReasonable risk-benefit\\u201d? The Summary doesn\\u2019t say how many sick or dead per million is reasonable. (Please see also)\\n\\nOne wonders if they were aware of earlier studies, referred to by Andrew Michrowski, PhD at the 2009 Toronto Whole Life Expo (see section, Key Testimony in Toronto in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMichrowski interprets the data for us: \\u201cAnalysis of 1950 -1974 mortality of 40,000 Korean War veterans shows that microwave exposure effect is cumulative [emphasis added] it affects all deaths \\u2026 doubling to tripling cancers of eye, brain and central nervous system, lymphatic and hematopoietic [blood-cell/platelet-forming] and digestive systems. This means that even \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures from wireless systems accumulate over the years and decades to engender serious diseases\\u201d (can\\u2019t be said too often).\\n\\nNor do we know if the Warsaw International Symposium or its WHO reviewers were aware that the US military and others conducted microwave stealth-weapon research in the 1950s. This technology became 2G. See Sections Assault: From Weapon to Telecom and Ultimate Atrocity in the Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nOpposition warnings frequently emphasize \\u2018protecting you and your family.\\u2019 The point having been made several times is worth repeating: The most dire threat is to the ecosystem, not humans. No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\nEnvironment usually suffers in the background of hysteria. One will see lists something like this: \\u201chealth, privacy, security, and the environment.\\u201d\\n\\nThose who offer exposure \\u201csolutions\\u201d or \\u201ctips\\u201d seem to forget that no form or amount of human protection does so for Nature. A false sense of security in being \\u201csafer\\u201d leads to continued use and support of the overall system, immeasurably intensifying that threat.\\n\\nInsects, for example, are highly susceptible to telecom/WiFi microwave, especially to MMW, which we haven\\u2019t even had yet. In the last quarter century or so, coinciding closely with the introduction of 2G, 75% of the biomass of insects has disappeared in otherwise protected areas in Germany. Meaning it\\u2019s probably worse where other threats co-exist.\\n\\nEmphatically: The wireless threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. We need to look at the context of wireless, which is technology, per se. And one thing is certain about most of that, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\nIn almost all cases, somewhere along the line from resource acquisition (especially mining) to manufacture, use, and disposal, advanced technology is chemically/energetically toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless encompasses the entire line of a process of Earth liquidation/sacrifice for human \\u201cneeds\\u201d \\u2013 money, convenience, and entertainment (see section The Price of Techno-Civilization in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMoving to \\u201cwired\\u201d telecom/WiFi will not stop this assault. Countries are under siege for resources. Nor will the Elite psyops \\u201cSustainable Development\\u201d and \\u201cClean Renewable Energy\\u201d stop it. But that\\u2019s another article.\\n\\nThe attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed. I ask that anyone who can name a major environmental or health crisis in which technology isn\\u2019t the cause or doesn\\u2019t play a major role, comment about it.\\n\\nLooking at the overall output of \\u201cconcerned\\u201d EMF scientists and activists, however, if one isn\\u2019t careful, one could conclude it\\u2019s thought that humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\nAnother major concern is disproportionate attention on local antennas, while a massive satellite program proceeds. At one point, up to 20,000 satellites were planned to blanket the globe. But the number keeps growing.\\n\\nMadman Elon Musk\\u2019s SpaceX had dibs on 12,000 for 5Gmmw. Here is news that Madman is applying for 30,000 more. Just 42,000 satellites will be about 5 times the total spacecraft launched since 1957 (8,500).\\n\\nSeveral other companies, including Boeing, OneWeb, Amazon, Facebook, not to mention Russia and China, mean many thousands more. Total madness could bring it to somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000. This considered sane. Why? Because insanity unrecognized as such has become the norm in the culture of toxic-technomasturbation.\\n\\nPollution. Some 150 tons of refined kerosene and 340 tons of liquid oxygen per Musk 5G launch (60 satellites, 400 kg each). Do the math, even for 12,000. There seems to be no concern for consequences, such as potential damage to the ozone layer, major interference with earth\\u2019s energy field, or even increased atmospheric CO2 (for the faithful). Not to mention, decline of breathable free oxygen (very cool dynamic graph).\\n\\nMuch seems to be up in the air on the satellite program. Since launches proceed in haste, the plan seems to be shoot them up first, answer proprietary questions later, dismissing anyone else\\u2019s. In Europe, there are currently calls for papers on satellite integration with 5G, with submissions deadline being the Ides of March 2020.\\n\\nNASA, NOAA, meteorologists, (and radio astronomers) have issued valid concerns about MMW. FCC has dismissed them, too. Yet, NASA intends to participate in this bit of insanity.\\n\\nMight such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates? Insane is a good word for it, but psychopathic puts a more specific tag on it. See subsections Same Old Story\\u2026 and \\u2026with a Twist in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nThe best way to beat 5G, on the ground at least, is to quit wireless tech flat. Little demand \\u2018down here\\u2019 could greatly reduce incentive to invest \\u2018up there\\u2019. If there is a total-surveillance and human-control system gestating in the technosphere, how much of a role could satellites play?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strongly suggested that an outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the one on earthbound antennas.\\n\\nTaking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\nAgain, a race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse. Allowing classic 4G (or even just 5G FR1) to continue potentiates imminent disaster. Both scenarios are in progress, but at the \\u2018deniable\\u2019 stage. When \\u2018undeniable\\u2019 sets in, the slope will almost certainly have become too steep and slippery.\\n\\nExperience shows that science-based appeals, to governments at all levels; to national and international regulatory bodies, and so on is an exercise in futility due to multiple factors, including corruption, disbelief, and intimidation. Old and chronic conditions.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s in the People\\u2019s hands now, at the commercial level. Either common sense prevails over addiction and selfishness, or we wait for the race to end and hope it\\u2019s not too late.\\n\\nGive up wireless per se or give up the future \\u2013 liberty first, then life. If not, then welcome all 5G, especially the satellites. Surrender to it will mercifully shorten the coming agony.\\n\\nPeter Tocci is a retired massage therapist and wellness consultant with an abiding interest in exploring \\u2018managed\\u2019 history, nefarious covert agendas, and mainstream/mainstream-alternative news-media dereliction, distortion and suppression.

Both provide means for quickly accessing areas of particular interest. But reading the full text is strongly encouraged. A small number of revisions might not appear in the Summaries.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\nWithout any help from \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers, the \\u201cnext generation\\u201d wireless is very dangerous \\u2014 all by itself \\u2014 as is each previous G by itself. But due to hysteria (illogic, inaccuracies and omissions), most opposition is also dangerous by itself.\\n\\nNot much has changed since this PC Mag article was published in 1/2019. And that doesn\\u2019t cover all critical aspects.\\n\\nConfusion begins right off the bat with the term \\u201c5G.\\u201d It\\u2019s being flung carelessly about, in articles, protests, news reports, corporate bulletins, by politicians \\u2013 even by scientists, and in submissions and comments to official bodies.\\n\\nAlmost always implied when \\u201c5G\\u201d is uttered \\u2013 especially, \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d or \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d \\u2013 is use of the \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This causes misunderstanding and potential danger.\\n\\nOverall, EHF is specified as 30 GHz to 300 GHz, and wavelength 10 millimeters to 1mm respectively. Only a small portion of that range is used in high-frequency 5G operation, and is defined in the US by the FCC as 24 GHz to 90 GHz.\\n\\nAs explained below in 5G Rollouts, for accuracy one must at least distinguish between 1) \\u2018small-cell\\u2019 infrastructure and 5G/small cells per se; 2) between 5G infrastructure and 5G high-frequency radiation; 3) between antennas and their enclosures, and **4) between high frequency 5G and mid-/low-band 5G, the signaling long used for 2G-4G iterations.\\n\\nNew terms are offered here for consistency and for clarifying hysteria-induced misunderstanding and confusion: \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d is a housing for antennas (sending/receiving elements). A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\nOne might see warnings such as: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSmall cell\\u201d is regularly misused, even by the Industry. Accurately speaking, a cell is not an antenna, but the effective area/range of an antenna\\u2019s radiation. 5Gmmw has a short range, which decreases with higher frequency. Thus, its cell is comparatively small.\\n\\nAlso, MMW can easily be blocked, even by even leaves and heavy rain, which deficiency increases with increasing frequency. Both drawbacks can be improved with a substantial power boost, but this also becomes a problem with energy cost and exposure levels, and so is not under consideration. Energy consumption is a major concern for the industry, which is feverishly at work to solve it.\\n\\nShort range and easy \\u2018blockability\\u2019 require more fixture locations, which hysteria frets about, rarely noting the distinction that 5Gmlb makes a large cell and is not blocked. Call it nitpicking if you will, but why not be accurate instead of creating misconception or \\u2018making cases\\u2019?\\n\\n\\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density, and common hysteria about how it will be implemented are in serious question (more later).\\n\\nOne interesting discovery came up while working on this article: Small cells are small but not new, and were not developed for 5G. Small cells have long been deployed in 3G and 4G networks and have become an industry choice to deliver MMW and enable better MLB performance if needed.\\n\\nTraditionally, there have been three types of small cells (more now), identified as they should be by antenna range. Some early deployments were in the US in 2007 and in the UK and Europe in 2009. \\u201cAccording to Small Cell Forum (who would have thought?), 18 million small cells had been deployed globally for various applications by the end of 2016.\\u201d\\n\\nBut haven\\u2019t we been led in a virtually deliberate way from the outset, and even continue to be, to think that 5G is small cells/MMW? Saying \\u201c5G\\u201d to indicate only these two things, or not specifying what you mean, is irresponsible, inaccurate, and misleading, as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nA 10/8/19 bulletin from Project Censored was forwarded to me via an email group that received it from Joel M. Moskowitz, PhD, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at UC Berkeley. A typically careless statement consisting of an error and a question mark says, \\u201cThe telecom industry is promoting the replacement of the current cellular network, known as 4G, with a new generation of higher frequency 5G wavelengths to power the \\u201cInternet of Things\\u2026\\u201d As a generalization, this is either shameful unawareness of the current scenario or untruth/propaganda, as we\\u2019ll also see.\\n\\n5G opposition also asserts that the skin\\u2019s (spiral) sweat ducts act as \\u201creceiving antennas.\\u201d This refers to an Israeli study, \\u201cThe human skin as a sub-THz receiver \\u2013 Does 5G pose a danger to it or not?\\u201d\\n\\nFrequency ranges don\\u2019t transition abruptly, but sub-THz usually means a range of 300 GHz down to 90, which is the upper end of FCC 5Gmmw.\\n\\nThe study Abstract uses two unquantified terms, \\u201csub-terahertz band\\u201d and \\u201csub-THz region.\\u201d I think \\u201cregion\\u201d is more accurate, meaning the range, or \\u201cspectrum\\u201d as understood in tech circles. \\u201cBand\\u201d is used to designate a single frequency, but also is an interval between a lower and upper frequency. For instance, a transmission between 40 and 50 MHz is a 10 MHz band (width).\\n\\nStudy frequencies were 75 GHz to 110 GHz. No wireless provider I\\u2019m aware of (in the US) has announced a mobile 5Gmmw service anywhere near 75 GHz. There was no explanation in the Abstract why announced commercial frequencies were not used.\\n\\nPower-level exposure limits at the user end are expressed in watts per area, usually square meter or square centimeter. No such levels are provided for the targets used, but maybe that\\u2019s not relevant in this case.\\n\\nThe highest commercial frequency I could find being tested is in the UK (though also approved for US), is 60 GHz. At least one rural test area is reportedly using a 60 GHz \\u201cwireless mesh\\u201d (interior network of interacting antennas) for \\u2018super WiFi.\\u2019 Not for mobile and still not up to 75 GHz.\\n\\nInteresting is that other UK rural testbeds are running unused TV bands called \\u201cTV white space\\u201d \\u2014 the old VHF to UHF frequencies, mostly MHz bands. This is 5G, mind you.\\n\\nHowever, bandwidths 71 to 76 GHz, 81 to 86 GHz and 92 to 95 GHz are available in the US for \\u201chigh-density\\u201d (high power) \\u201cfixed wireless access\\u201d services: \\u201c\\u2026the operation of wireless communication devices or systems used to connect two fixed locations (e.g., building to building or tower to building) with a radio or other wireless link\\u2026\\u201d, which would have to be line-of-sight and are not for mobile.\\n\\nAs noted, the higher the frequency, the greater are transmission challenges, so high-density bands would be very tight beams, with minimal to no obstacles and no human exposure (watch out, pigeons). Due to excess electricity consumption, MMW signals probably won\\u2019t be power boosted sufficiently to penetrate buildings, but be brought in via cable from an external receiver, then be distributed via a wireless network.\\n\\nStudy conclusion: \\u201cWe are raising a warning flag against the unrestricted use of sub-THz technologies for communication, before the possible consequences for public health are explored.\\u201d This seems sane enough \\u2013 within the insane context called wireless telecom/WiFi. See Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (needs updating).\\n\\nBut \\u201cunrestricted\\u201d at least suggests the impossible, that restrictions could prevent all trouble. Note also \\u201cpossible consequences.\\u201d This can\\u2019t be valid for harm in general, which is a fact long understood \\u2013 almost three decades before 2G came out (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\nWhen this warning is given, we don\\u2019t hear that the \\u201cwarning flag\\u201d would apply conceptually to all G\\u2019s; presumes there is a safe dose of MLB somewhere; and, as usual, neglects the ecosystem. But \\u2014 enough for protesters to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas? Making cases? I confess I fell for this one in my early research on wireless. A more likely, but still speculative, concern is discussed in Reports of \\u201c5G\\u201d Harm.\\n\\nAnother common warning, \\u201c5G is a weapon,\\u201d usually refers to the military\\u2019s Active Denial System, a \\u201cnon-lethal\\u201d microwave device for dispersing crowds by heating the skin. It\\u2019s a high density (power) millimeter wave at 95 GHz \\u2013 hardly commercial 5Gmmw.\\n\\nMMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G. Wireless telecom, beginning with 2G, is adapted stealth-weapon technology which uses very low power. The entire wireless system, not just \\u201c5G\\u201d, is a potential weapon on various levels (more below).\\n\\nAlso, high-enough density microwave \\u2014 at a \\u2018lowly\\u2019 2.5 GHz, for example \\u2014 will cook you like a microwave oven (2.45 GHz). That is, through and through, unlike ADS. At commercial power levels, 5Gmmw will not.\\n\\nA powerful Air Force radar system called Pave Paws at three US locations will cook you in a nanosecond at 420 to 450 MHz. Installations have two large circular arrays of antenna elements, each array radiating 580 kilowatts (!) It can detect a basketball at 12 miles, and small planes caught in the beam have blown up. So don\\u2019t swallow the rhetoric about telecom MMW weaponry.\\n\\nI was unable to find a range of ADS power output, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study calling out 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2) at 94 GHz (see Reports of Harm). ADS power is adjustable, however, enough to be used as a lethal weapon. But \\u2013 \\u2018making cases\\u2019 again?\\n\\nMicrowave ovens operate from 600 to 1200 watts. By comparison, maximum output of traditional cell towers is 10 watts \\u2013 phones, 2 watts. The higher frequency/shorter wavelength was chosen for ADS to limit penetration depth. Not saying that\\u2019s a good thing, not to mention it\\u2019s misleading (see Reports of Harm).\\n\\nFinding a wattage output figure for new, 5G MLB or MMW antennas proved fruitlessly time consuming (anyone?), but I did find a study establishing a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for a particular 5Gmmw antenna design for 28 and 38 GHz.\\n\\nSAR is an expression of how much radiation from a phone is absorbed over time by the body. It\\u2019s expressed in watts per kilogram (W/kg). Values were \\u201c\\u20260.37 and 1.34 W/kg [up to] 2 W/kg. Current FCC SAR standard is 1.6W/kg. This is given just for a sense of comparison, because SAR is useless for determining the amount of radiofrequency (RF) absorption in biosystems during typical conditions of use. See Safety Testing below.\\n\\nMany opposers suggest that 3G/4G/WiFi can be made reasonably safe. Others understand that impossibility, but seem too habituated and addicted to do the right thing. As noted in the Introduction, techno-humans are adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\n\\u201cNo \\u20185G\\u2019 safety studies have been conducted or funded by the Federal Communications Commission or the telecom industry, and none is planned.\\u201d Or simply, \\u201c5G has not been tested for safety\\u201d. Or the like. No such claims provide the facts.\\n\\nThat the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d terror, whereas, the real terror is wireless tech per se. Inherent in this ploy is the erroneous implication that 2G-4G were tested (a yes and no proposition).\\n\\nIn 1996, FCC adopted the standard identified as ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992. There were \\u2018window dressings\\u2019 in 2004, 2005, and 2010, and, like the original, covered frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019. (Overall \\u2018microwave\\u2019 is considered to be 300 MHz (.3 GHz) to 300 GHz.\\n\\nThe Commission\\u2019s assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is based on the fraudulent IEEE \\u2018testing\\u2019 it adopted in 1996 to run interference for 3G. That is, if the radiation doesn\\u2019t heat you, it can\\u2019t harm you.\\n\\nThis author warned of this response by FCC in February 2019 as \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria was powering up: Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised? Exposure limits worldwide are based on the ANSI/IEEE C95.1 fraud.\\n\\nPeer reviewed independent science, as early as the 1950s and still going, demonstrating myriad effects at non-heating levels, brings the integrity of C95.1-1992 through 2019 into question. Was *proper* testing ever done? Instead of clarifying this, hysteria makes the blanket claim. Making cases.\\n\\nThe FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science and such questions: \\u2018No convincing evidence exists, but we\\u2019re keeping an eye on it.\\u2019 The blatant criminality of the FCC with respect to wireless/EMF is clearly demonstrated by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nHysteria often resorts to another \\u2018ploy on words\\u2019 pertaining to 2G-4G, and used even by scientists, as seen near the end of this report: \\u201cThe current FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d The word implies that standards were at one time valid or sufficient, when they were never any such thing, for any living thing.\\n\\n\\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing has been demonstrated or can exist. Despite this, new limits are proposed and stubbornly called for \\u2014 in spite of the consensus that no safe level has even been published for fetuses.\\n\\nApparently, that\\u2019s not of sufficient concern to call for \\u201cStop Wireless Technology!\\u201d instead of \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d We\\u2019ll figure that fetus part out later.\\n\\nFor details on the original \\u2018safety\\u2019 testing \\u2013 scientific fraud, that is, on which power-level exposure limits worldwide are based \\u2013 see Sections Cell Phone Output and Exposure Limits for Users in the article Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\nMajor emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA,\\u2019 due to the short range and easy block-ability of MMW. But things seem to be developing differently for now, as we\\u2019ll see. As noted, even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\nThe following synthesis is the result of wading through too many articles to give credit to any one. Some sources tell varying stories about the same thing, and even disagree with each other considerably.\\n\\nSo here goes: A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard has been issued, specifying two frequency ranges: 5G NR bands FR1 & 5G NR bands FR2. Number one is for current bands below 6 GHz (5Gmlb), such as 600MHz, 1900MHz, and 2.5GHz; two is for MMW \\u2014 mostly 24 to 40 GHz for mobile, and higher for special applications (not mobile). In the near term, public WiFi will remain separate at MLB, 2.45 GHz and 5 GHz, but Verizon, for example, is offering 5Gmmw home internet/WiFi (not mobile) in limited areas of four cities.\\n\\n5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention at this point, including especially \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and \\u2018beamforming\\u2019 (more later).\\n\\nHowever, 5G NR FR1 can use the same towers as 4G, but will need new antennas. It has the same reach and penetration, but with shorter delay, while providing up to 35 percent more speed. The wireless addict\\u2019s dream. When you think about it, FR1 should really be 5G, and 5Gmmw, 6G.\\n\\nPlans are also in place for deployments using the unlicensed, Citizens Broadband Radio Service 3.5 GHz band, and all key players really want in. This is MLB called 5G, mind you.\\n\\nThings get a bit stickier when it comes to needing a new phone or not. Many current phones should be able to get updates to process FR1, but a new phone is needed for FR2. Generally, the \\u201ctech\\u201d advice is not to move yet, and here\\u2019s an example with Samsung\\u2019s $1300 5G Galaxy S10 being tested in Chicago (good shot of a 5Gmmw \\u201cnode\\u201d here).\\n\\nThe \\u201chold off\\u201d sentiment is conveyed also in this article. What it amounts to at this writing is that 5Gmmw is virtually at a \\u201cdemo\\u201d stage, not full coverage and service, even in town.\\n\\nMany \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers continue to use traditional 3G/4G/WiFi wireless, either knowing the danger or believing it\\u2019s safe, or will be, because they just want it. A possible motive driving hysteria?\\n\\nAnother possible motive for \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, or maybe just the effect it\\u2019s having, is to create a threat on the ground to draw resistance and to distract attention from the satellite program, a much more sinister development (see Examining Priorities below).\\n\\nThe disconnect about dangers brings up a story that drew wide attention at the time, especially in the UK, and one that seems to present a puzzle. It\\u2019s about the 6/26 2019 Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, Somerset County, England. It\\u2019s not strictly a \\u201crollout\\u201d story, more a system demo/test, but a decision was announced about installing \\u201c5G\\u201d network towers on festival grounds,\\n\\nDespite the fact that \\u201cGlastonbury officials [said] that move will allow festival attendees to access the Internet on their smartphones at faster speeds,\\u201d the announcement created a huge protest. In this story, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G are mentioned, but \\u201c5G\\u201d is not specified as MLB or MMW \\u2014 as anything, in other words. Is this hysteria-induced negligence?\\n\\nThe protest article is laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated one that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d. Even some much-admired professional associates/contacts promote this irresponsible notion. I must respectfully, but strongly, disagree, because the erroneous implication is that 2G-4G were/are not an experiment. Paradoxically, they were/are and were/are not experiments. Distinctions must be made (more below).\\n\\nConfusion again: \\u201cWhile obviously not many festival-goers are likely to have a \\u20185G\\u2019 phone by June, EE will be showing off what the network can do at its stand.\\u201d Once again, unspecified 5G. So, was the Glastonbury demo about 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb? Whatever, tickets sold out in less than 45 minutes.\\n\\nThe grand protest by potential attendees was both tragic and macabrely amusing: They were prepared to irradiate themselves constantly in huge numbers (up to 200,000 fans in attendance potentially using phones/smartphones), but fretted over \\u201c5G\\u201d, not even knowing it could have been their beloved 4G poison\\u2026reborn. Phone radiation is often overlooked.\\n\\nSimilarly, reports on the 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland clearly reflect the confusion and negligent use of \\u201c5G.\\u201d This Agence France-Presse story says, \\u201cBy early July, 334 antennae (sic) stations for 5G were operational across the country, authorities have told AFP.\\u201d Boy, watch out for authorities.\\n\\nAntenna location and density info aren\\u2019t revealed, but it could be urban or \\u2018near-urban.\\u2019 The number doesn\\u2019t seem to correspond to FLD in neighborhoods, but who knows, thanks to incomplete reporting (and perhaps misled authorities). The news reader is therefore in the dark about exactly what\\u2019s going on, but probably assumes it\\u2019s MMW. Due to\\u2026 \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s (but beginning much earlier). What was known then was later hushed in the runup to digital mobile telecom in 1991-2.\\n\\nThe decision was callously made long ago to put life/people at risk to have the technology (see History of Official Awareness below). Thus, the yes/no \\u201cexperiment\\u201d is not whether there will be harm from telecom/WiFi microwave, but the time window in which ongoing exposure damage \\u2014 across all frequencies and regardless of power level \\u2014 will manifest in a cascade of widespread intractable illness.\\n\\nNot to worry, though, that fate might be avoided: Ecosystem collapse could bring the house down beforehand. You might hear/see, \\u201cThe 5G race is on,\\u201d meaning market competition. The race of note, though, is between ecosystem collapse and human-health collapse.\\n\\nIn any case, here\\u2019s some of what\\u2019s happening in \\u2018real\\u2019 life. The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon. Carriers are choosing service areas for FR1, FR2 very carefully.\\n\\nT-Mobile has announced a nationwide 5Gmlb rollout at 600 MHz and an undisclosed application of \\u201c28 and 39\\u201d (see video), which means some 5Gmmw, almost certainly in cities.\\n\\nSprint\\u2019s plans are to run \\u201cLTE and 5G\\u201d simultaneously in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\nMentioned earlier, Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d (allegedly MMW \\u2013 5Gmmw) is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range to cover wide area\\u201d (5Gmlb), doesn\\u2019t say where.\\n\\nSacramento seems to be the most enthusiastic victim host for wireless. Here\\u2019s a gushing PR piece about a Verizon UWB installation at one Sacramento citizen\\u2019s home, with City officials attending. It features an external receiver. Sacramento also prides itself on opening the floodgates for \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more later).\\n\\nVerizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas, which could be its final destination. Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason. Ecocidal, terminally pathological 3G/4G still rages, again reflecting the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nThe forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. As noted earlier, drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for \\u201c18 million new\\u201d closely spaced fixtures nationwide. Given the above information on FR1 rollouts, there seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\nA report on new Qualcomm smartphone antennas supports the foregoing. It covers four bands between 26.5GHz and 40 GHz, but also antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 The QPM56xx RF module family works with the Snapdragon X50 modem to work in the sub-6GHz bands\\u2026\\u201d (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\nOne puzzle: It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) as specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs seem to disagree, saying 4G can handle IoT. Propaganda? Careless chatter? Who knows. It\\u2019s safe to assume, however, they refer to the new 4G/5Gmlb.\\n\\nSome opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. And the attempted widespread deployment of smart utility meters on 4G WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say. 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, because if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\nI didn\\u2019t bother spending the rest of my life trying to find if/where FLD installations are occurring. Anyone who\\u2019s seen close installations in any area, please share details in Comments.\\n\\nNow, if FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose. One, possibility of course, is optimized 5Gmlb performance, as in the past, although this shouldn\\u2019t often be necessary, due to the large cell and penetration of MLB.\\n\\nIn the entrained, FLD frame of mind, I was suspicious in Wireless Technology: \\u2026 (The 5G Locomotive section) of Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams\\u2019 statement in a 5/15/18 CNBC interview that antennas in your face is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019d say he was being coy, implying MLB, and being careful not to depict 5G accurately, since 5Gmmw must have increased FLD, while 5Gmlb, not for the most part.\\n\\nMcAdam touted 5Gmmw for smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality, all good reasons for planetary and health destruction. But remember, all the \\u201cSmart\\u201d out there now is WiFi, for which there is no 5Gmmw (although Verizon\\u2019s UWB Home Internet might qualify). \\u201cSmart\\u201d is the wireless tech word for monumentally stupid \\u2014 and for total surveillance and centralized coordination and control of daily life. See section The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026.\\n\\nNone of the above means things can\\u2019t change. It\\u2019s early. The MLB rollout could be just a prelude to an FLD/MMW invasion. If MMW gets a toe-hold and no one\\u2019s coming up provably sick, and people like it, it could weaken opposition and open floodgates.\\n\\nAnd there\\u2019s the question of how the many thousands of planned satellites (looking now like well more than 50,000) fit into the overall picture. Obviously, coverage comes immediately to mind, such as saturation in outlying areas? For IoT? One issue for satellites, though, is increased delay time (\\u201clatency\\u201d) due to distance. There could be a \\u2018division of labor\\u2019 among various services, such as ground for mobile and sats for entertainment.\\n\\nNote the promise of the nationwide sySTEMic programming to make kids into corporate plug-ins or hitech drones: \\u201cSTEM education emphasizes the value of a rigorous, interdisciplinary approach to education, allowing students to compete and succeed in a modern global marketplace.\\u201d How many dubious assumptions, claims and buzzwords in that PR flak?\\n\\nSTEM promises a wondrous, prosperous, techno-shiny future. It exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. In the developed world, the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum total of the latter. Speaking of which, once a city is immersed in \\u201csmart\\u201d tech, it\\u2019s likely to become a special target of hackers. Imagine the potential chaos.)\\n\\nThere have been various reports of adverse effects when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, almost certainly implying 5Gmmw. This would seem unlikely, virtually impossible, outside cities/populous areas.\\n\\nApparently, people see new infrastructure dense or not, or/and feel effects, and apparently assume MMW is in use, as we saw in the Bern example.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d harm stories consistently report symptoms existing before anyone even heard of 5G. Long before. All reported harms I\\u2019ve seen are classic 2G-4G symptoms, and mostly of the \\u2018Electrohypersensitivity\\u2019 type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\nRadiation/RF-level meters have been used to support claims. But RF meters don\\u2019t display frequencies, only power level within a range of frequencies. Ordinary meters, costing from around $120 to $400, top out at 8 GHz. 3G/4G mobile frequencies range from 600 megahertz to 2.5 GHz in the US, with 3.5 GHz coming. WiFi is 2.4 and 5 GHz. Recall, FCC defines 5Gmmw as 24 GHz to 90 GHz. Thus, current meters can\\u2019t read MMW.\\n\\nA true 5G phone would identify MMW (and MLB at this point). Professional (very expensive) meters cover low and high ranges into the upper GHz (I found one 10 MHz to 220 GHz), but also don\\u2019t display frequencies, so all frequencies present still couldn\\u2019t be identified.\\n\\nLong-term exposure, perhaps a cumulative effect, is playing into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Thus, if there is harm when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, what\\u2019s shown by existing meters? Not understood by victims and reporters? 4G, one way or another. Hysteria-induced confusion.\\n\\nOne hawker claims its meter can read \\u201c5G\\u201d based on the fact that two new MLB frequencies are used for 5G (mlb). Any old meter does this. This ruse brought to you by \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nMeters are interesting, but not really helpful for most people. Radiation is everywhere; no amount of exposure is safe; most bio-effects below heating are power-independent; and effects may be cumulative (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nA meter might come in handy for someone with outward symptoms and using some form of shielding, for example. It could be seen at what level symptoms abate \\u2013 which doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops. Most likely, it\\u2019s palliation, but it can still save much grief and help people function.\\n\\nWe can come to cautious conclusion about the frequency present by type of effect. Known effects of MMW (a limited volume of science, though growing) differ from MLB effects long reported in the voluminous dismissed science.\\n\\nMMW potentially threatens skin and eyes, but more effects are being reported, although sometimes \\u2018stretched.\\u2019 For example, a paper cited (in an article by a prominent scientist who must remain anonymous) to show that 5Gmmw impacts \\u201cheart rate variability\\u201d was a military directed-energy study (see Author Information) using 94 GHz at 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2). That\\u2019s essentially the \\u201cADS\\u201d system noted earlier.\\n\\nNot only is 75 mW 75 times the main FCC limit (limits vary with frequency), but 94 is a frequency higher than the upper limit of 5Gmmw defined by the FCC, and certainly wouldn\\u2019t be used in mobile applications. Making cases?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not that MMW can\\u2019t create MLB effects, but it\\u2019s a bit speculative at this point. It\\u2019s possible, however \\u201c\\u2026since nerves, blood vessels and other electrically conducting structures can carry radiation-induced currents deep into the body\\u201d (see section 5G is qualitatively and quantitatively different from 4G)\\n\\nAntenna technology called MIMO (pron. my-mo) has been around for about a decade now for MLB. The more recent development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, meaning many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming (and receiving) beams of radiation. It looks to be destined for both FR1 and FR2 (a virtual necessity for MMW). As noted, Sprint will use this at for 5G at 3.5 GHz.\\n\\nOne question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose an additional threat. It\\u2019s possible they have an effect different from traditional antennas. Also, it seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of many focused beams, although being immersed in a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\nIn any case, aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying a beam from point to point (line of sight) avoids high power output per beam, since penetration of intervening structures isn\\u2019t required.\\n\\nHysteria often warns of outrageously high power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d As noted, effects occur at all levels below heating, which is why 3G/4G need to go. And it would not behoove the industry for people to suddenly be suffering heat damage.\\n\\nDetails of several typical news reports follow. Most demonstrate the fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one shows a more general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\nThe story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from a Verizon antenna installed near the home illustrates confusion. The first video on this page shows testimony before the Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with the mayor present.\\n\\nThe type of antenna isn\\u2019t given. But it\\u2019s probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. We learned from the \\u201cgushing PR piece\\u201d cited in the 5G Rollouts section that Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strange that the testimony date precedes the stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests prior to the grand \\u201cunveiling,\\u201d so it could have been an early \\u201cHome\\u201d antenna. Or maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\nThe opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that ambiguous statement mean to the person who wrote it? To the viewer? The incident suggests harm (cold/flu symptoms) from 5Gmmw but still reinforces the importance of knowing what we mean when we say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\nThe mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although her prepared speech commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but the suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness, even though levels \\u201care still very high\\u201d will certainly be taken officially as \\u201ccorrelation,\\u201d not proof or even evidence.\\n\\nTypically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\nBottom line: Which 5G is present is academic, since the pre-\\u201c5G\\u201d endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal. Focus on \\u201c5G\\u201d is like fretting about a wildfire 10 miles away while your house is burning down.\\n\\nOne of the more outrageous opposition-induced hysterias in recent times is a story from Gateshead, a town in northern UK near the North Sea, that new LED street lights (no microwave fixtures on them, just the lights) were emitting \\u201c5G\\u201d and causing health issues. This was carelessly picked up by other outlets. No one gave a moment\\u2019s thought to the likelihood that it might be LED lights themselves.\\n\\nA news report from Cincinnati clearly demonstrates that folks are in the dark about what 5G is, thanks to hysteria. And a fairly well-known one from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, to its credit, shows a better general awareness of wireless threat. But both demonstrate questionable thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make them safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem).\\n\\nScroll down this page to see an RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story. Regardless of one\\u2019s opinion of RT, this one\\u2019s a great and accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\nThe original story from 9/20/19 (now includes an update) is a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria,\\u201d since no one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers up to this point. It involves a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that \\u201cpeople fear\\u201d will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d.\\n\\nThe 9/27/19 update shows a video interview with a concerned nurse, a conditioned \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacking understanding of the wireless threat. She\\u2019ll feel safer if that nasty tall tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\nThe tall, new-look tower with the cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video) is clearly not the massive MIMO 5Gmmw/small-cell type shown in the 5G-phone report in the 5G Rollouts section. That was Verizon\\u2019s.\\n\\nThe update also says the tower is Sprint\\u2019s. As noted, Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using massive MIMO. It being a Sprint tower, it\\u2019s not MMW. The \\u201c5G\\u201d fear was an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\nSo what\\u2019s in the cylindrical fixture? Could be 4G (LTE), 5Gmlb (\\u201c5G\\u201d), WiFi as well? WiMax? One question \\u2013 is it MIMO? Massive? Anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\nThe update notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are also popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman David Weissmann confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what? From what we\\u2019ve seen of Verizon, probably 5Gmlb, i.e., 4G LTE on FR1 steroids.\\n\\nThe San Joaquin report, from 3/12/19 also concerns a tall tower with a cylindrical fixture. But this isn\\u2019t about 5G, but about \\u201ca cell tower\\u201d being too close to an elementary school in Ripon with a \\u2018cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\n\\u201cAll in all, three teachers and four students have been battling various cancers since 2016,\\u201d as well as a 22-year-old former male student. Of course, those teachers and that young man \\u2018never\\u2019 used a wireless device, and never near that tower. Nor were they exposed to another tower or anyone else\\u2019s phone. This doesn\\u2019t seem to dawn on people.\\n\\nThe Ripon case is interesting. An independent expert was consulted, who contradicted official assurance that the tower tested within federal standards. He said he wouldn\\u2019t send his kids there, because kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed \\u2013 as if they\\u2019re not exposed 24/7 anywhere a phone/tower system is working, not only from towers, but many phones as well. And does he think that once you\\u2019re \\u201cdeveloped\\u201d it\\u2019s OK?\\n\\nSprint subsequently shut it down and agreed to relocate, guilty or not. The move was good PR, and indicates that companies and municipalities will back down \\u2013 probably to avoid litigation, since that could open floodgates.\\n\\nRipon is important for two more reasons. The first is the usually overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure (see History of Official Awareness below). It\\u2019s well known, for example, that effects from cigarette tobacco and ionizing radiation (like a hospital X-ray), are cumulative. There\\u2019s no reason wireless radiation should be any different.\\n\\nMost kids are heavily exposed in our wireless world, wherever they are \\u2013 many from conception, and even before that, especially to ovarian DNA damage. This is one egregious crime of the technology.\\n\\nThe second reason is the bogus advice that \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the false argument for slow death over quicker death, or the futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can even make things worse. The farther the source, the greater are reflection and refraction of signals, creating a far more chaotic condition for the body to handle. Any telecom/WiFi antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\nReducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usually usage tips but also lower exposure limits. Despite calls for the latter, it holds mostly for heating. For non-heating effects, lower power could even increase the threat, since there\\u2019s a good chance that the closer we get to the minute power levels used by biosystems for intercellular communication, a greater confusion sets in.\\n\\nWith regard to usage tips, \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures accumulate over time to engender serious disease \\u2013 of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem, whose damage these clever warnings for humans worsen.\\n\\nThe problem is that reliance on power level alone to determine safety is largely a convenience (there\\u2019s that fatal word again), not science. The reader doesn\\u2019t need to understand the following terms, just that there are several factors in play, including whether the signal is continuous or pulsed, the shape of the pulsations, the rise time, fall time and duration of the pulsations, the type and depth of modulation, the frequencies, and the bandwidth.\\n\\nTry to set a \\u201csafe\\u201d exposure limit based on all that. So they keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\nA corollary is that folks claiming harm seem to think it\\u2019s for the first time. This is fatal error. There are also stories wherein people or animals affected by, say, a Smart meter, regard symptom abatement when the meter is removed as complete recovery. More fatal error. People have no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway. By now, the reader should know why.\\n\\nAn Idaho organization, ehsidaho.com, collects reports on the incidence and effects of what\\u2019s being called electrohypersensitivity, or EHS. The term is misleading, because no living thing is unaffected by the radiation, whether it manifests outwardly or not. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 is suggested.\\n\\nAn estimated 35% of the population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\nClaire Edwards, a former UN staffer, top writer and wireless activist said to me in an email that an estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. The rest of society is virtually thumbing its nose at these unfortunate people. But they\\u2019ll also suffer if this red flag is ignored: As bad as this sensitivity is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad, either in incidence or severity, as things could quickly and easily get.\\n\\nIllness caused by wireless radiation is not new or unique to it, even though there are lists and categories of issues attributed to it. In medicine, a symptom can be caused by any number of influences, and a single influence can cause various symptoms.\\n\\nSo a big question is, how much of today\\u2019s ongoing ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 that is, defined and named prior to the wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to telecom/WiFi radiation (or even the whole radiation gamut to which we expose ourselves)?\\n\\nIf officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\nThus even for EMF-sick users \\u2014 who are much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors (oblivious) attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\nBut quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 is what must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\nManifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere (see The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026).\\n\\nIf we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\nOf the several historical documents acknowledging the deleterious effects of artificial electromagnetic fields denied by FCC, the definitive one for wireless tech seems to be a 1981 World Health Organization (WHO) report entitled Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973. (I\\u2019ve always thought it unfortunate and instructive that \\u201cenvironmental health\\u201d is not about techno-human torment of Earth, but concern about just payback for the tormentor).\\n\\nThe report is long, covering many aspects. It covers all telecom/WiFi frequencies, including MMW; but real-world harm for the last three decades has come, and continues from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\nAs forthright as the WHO publication purports to be, the Summary reveals a distressing ruthlessness. It\\u2019s all most people need to read to understand that \\u2018they\\u2019 knew. For reader convenience, a brief review follows.\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.3 Biological effects in experimental animals: It has been demonstrated that low-level, long-term exposure may induce effects in the nervous, haematopoietic (production of blood cells and platelets), and immuno-competent cell systems of animals. Such effects have been reported in small animals (rodents) exposed to incident power density levels as low as 0.1-1.0 mW/cm2\\u201d (\\u201cmW\\u201d = milliwatt \\u2013 one thousandth of a watt). So this is one tenth of one thousandth of a watt to one thousandth of a watt per square centimeter. FCC limit: one thousandth of a watt \\u2013 1 mW/cm2 (for frequencies 1500 MHz \\u2013 100 GHz).\\n\\n\\u201cThe reported effects on the nervous system include behavioural, bioelectrical, metabolic, and structural (at the cellular and subcellular levels) changes. Erythrocyte production and haemaglobin synthesis may be impaired and immunological reactivity changed.\\u201d OK so far (except for exploiting/hurting animals).\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.6: Health risk evaluation as a basis for exposure limits: \\u2026 A highly conservative approach would be to keep exposure limits close to natural background levels. However, this is not technically feasible [emphasis added]. A reasonable risk-benefit analysis has to be considered.\\u201d\\n\\nIs \\u201chighly conservative\\u201d a euphemism for \\u201csafe\\u201d? And what does \\u201cclose\\u201d mean? In any case, the \\u201cbackground level,\\u201c called the cosmic background is 0.0000000001 \\u2013 0.000000000000001 \\u00b5W/cm2 (\\u00b5W = microwatt \\u2013 one millionth of a watt). Thus, the higher background limit (first one) is one ten billionth of a millionth of a watt (sounds like just a few electrons to me \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nFCC limit is on the other side of the decimal point at 1000 \\u00b5W/cm2. a thousand millionths of a watt \\u2013 per square centimeter, that is. Frankly, the author\\u2019s head goes into a spin with these minuscule decimals, but it\\u2019s safe to say there\\u2019s a bit of a margin between FCC and Cosmos \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nThe FCC limit is outrageous even compared to the most conservative proposed \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit: .003 \\u2013 .006 \\u00b5W/cm2. and the BioInitiative Report authors say it might even need to be lower..\\n\\nImportantly, however, the cosmic variety is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed). That means there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limit after all: zero.\\n\\n\\u201cNot technically feasible\\u201d? Well, of course. Technology is more important than health in some minds. \\u201cReasonable risk-benefit\\u201d? The Summary doesn\\u2019t say how many sick or dead per million is reasonable. (Please see also)\\n\\nOne wonders if they were aware of earlier studies, referred to by Andrew Michrowski, PhD at the 2009 Toronto Whole Life Expo (see section, Key Testimony in Toronto in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMichrowski interprets the data for us: \\u201cAnalysis of 1950 -1974 mortality of 40,000 Korean War veterans shows that microwave exposure effect is cumulative [emphasis added] it affects all deaths \\u2026 doubling to tripling cancers of eye, brain and central nervous system, lymphatic and hematopoietic [blood-cell/platelet-forming] and digestive systems. This means that even \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures from wireless systems accumulate over the years and decades to engender serious diseases\\u201d (can\\u2019t be said too often).\\n\\nNor do we know if the Warsaw International Symposium or its WHO reviewers were aware that the US military and others conducted microwave stealth-weapon research in the 1950s. This technology became 2G. See Sections Assault: From Weapon to Telecom and Ultimate Atrocity in the Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nOpposition warnings frequently emphasize \\u2018protecting you and your family.\\u2019 The point having been made several times is worth repeating: The most dire threat is to the ecosystem, not humans. No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\nEnvironment usually suffers in the background of hysteria. One will see lists something like this: \\u201chealth, privacy, security, and the environment.\\u201d\\n\\nThose who offer exposure \\u201csolutions\\u201d or \\u201ctips\\u201d seem to forget that no form or amount of human protection does so for Nature. A false sense of security in being \\u201csafer\\u201d leads to continued use and support of the overall system, immeasurably intensifying that threat.\\n\\nInsects, for example, are highly susceptible to telecom/WiFi microwave, especially to MMW, which we haven\\u2019t even had yet. In the last quarter century or so, coinciding closely with the introduction of 2G, 75% of the biomass of insects has disappeared in otherwise protected areas in Germany. Meaning it\\u2019s probably worse where other threats co-exist.\\n\\nEmphatically: The wireless threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. We need to look at the context of wireless, which is technology, per se. And one thing is certain about most of that, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\nIn almost all cases, somewhere along the line from resource acquisition (especially mining) to manufacture, use, and disposal, advanced technology is chemically/energetically toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless encompasses the entire line of a process of Earth liquidation/sacrifice for human \\u201cneeds\\u201d \\u2013 money, convenience, and entertainment (see section The Price of Techno-Civilization in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMoving to \\u201cwired\\u201d telecom/WiFi will not stop this assault. Countries are under siege for resources. Nor will the Elite psyops \\u201cSustainable Development\\u201d and \\u201cClean Renewable Energy\\u201d stop it. But that\\u2019s another article.\\n\\nThe attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed. I ask that anyone who can name a major environmental or health crisis in which technology isn\\u2019t the cause or doesn\\u2019t play a major role, comment about it.\\n\\nLooking at the overall output of \\u201cconcerned\\u201d EMF scientists and activists, however, if one isn\\u2019t careful, one could conclude it\\u2019s thought that humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\nAnother major concern is disproportionate attention on local antennas, while a massive satellite program proceeds. At one point, up to 20,000 satellites were planned to blanket the globe. But the number keeps growing.\\n\\nMadman Elon Musk\\u2019s SpaceX had dibs on 12,000 for 5Gmmw. Here is news that Madman is applying for 30,000 more. Just 42,000 satellites will be about 5 times the total spacecraft launched since 1957 (8,500).\\n\\nSeveral other companies, including Boeing, OneWeb, Amazon, Facebook, not to mention Russia and China, mean many thousands more. Total madness could bring it to somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000. This considered sane. Why? Because insanity unrecognized as such has become the norm in the culture of toxic-technomasturbation.\\n\\nPollution. Some 150 tons of refined kerosene and 340 tons of liquid oxygen per Musk 5G launch (60 satellites, 400 kg each). Do the math, even for 12,000. There seems to be no concern for consequences, such as potential damage to the ozone layer, major interference with earth\\u2019s energy field, or even increased atmospheric CO2 (for the faithful). Not to mention, decline of breathable free oxygen (very cool dynamic graph).\\n\\nMuch seems to be up in the air on the satellite program. Since launches proceed in haste, the plan seems to be shoot them up first, answer proprietary questions later, dismissing anyone else\\u2019s. In Europe, there are currently calls for papers on satellite integration with 5G, with submissions deadline being the Ides of March 2020.\\n\\nNASA, NOAA, meteorologists, (and radio astronomers) have issued valid concerns about MMW. FCC has dismissed them, too. Yet, NASA intends to participate in this bit of insanity.\\n\\nMight such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates? Insane is a good word for it, but psychopathic puts a more specific tag on it. See subsections Same Old Story\\u2026 and \\u2026with a Twist in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nThe best way to beat 5G, on the ground at least, is to quit wireless tech flat. Little demand \\u2018down here\\u2019 could greatly reduce incentive to invest \\u2018up there\\u2019. If there is a total-surveillance and human-control system gestating in the technosphere, how much of a role could satellites play?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strongly suggested that an outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the one on earthbound antennas.\\n\\nTaking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\nAgain, a race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse. Allowing classic 4G (or even just 5G FR1) to continue potentiates imminent disaster. Both scenarios are in progress, but at the \\u2018deniable\\u2019 stage. When \\u2018undeniable\\u2019 sets in, the slope will almost certainly have become too steep and slippery.\\n\\nExperience shows that science-based appeals, to governments at all levels; to national and international regulatory bodies, and so on is an exercise in futility due to multiple factors, including corruption, disbelief, and intimidation. Old and chronic conditions.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s in the People\\u2019s hands now, at the commercial level. Either common sense prevails over addiction and selfishness, or we wait for the race to end and hope it\\u2019s not too late.\\n\\nGive up wireless per se or give up the future \\u2013 liberty first, then life. If not, then welcome all 5G, especially the satellites.

Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts.

A Bullet Summary for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose detail, and a Text Summary, for those who want a more general sweep. Both provide means for quickly accessing areas of particular interest. But reading the full text is strongly encouraged. A small number of revisions might not appear in the Summaries.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\nWithout any help from \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers, the \\u201cnext generation\\u201d wireless is very dangerous \\u2014 all by itself \\u2014 as is each previous G by itself. But due to hysteria (illogic, inaccuracies and omissions), most opposition is also dangerous by itself.\\n\\nNot much has changed since this PC Mag article was published in 1/2019. And that doesn\\u2019t cover all critical aspects.\\n\\nConfusion begins right off the bat with the term \\u201c5G.\\u201d It\\u2019s being flung carelessly about, in articles, protests, news reports, corporate bulletins, by politicians \\u2013 even by scientists, and in submissions and comments to official bodies.\\n\\nAlmost always implied when \\u201c5G\\u201d is uttered \\u2013 especially, \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d or \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d \\u2013 is use of the \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This causes misunderstanding and potential danger.\\n\\nOverall, EHF is specified as 30 GHz to 300 GHz, and wavelength 10 millimeters to 1mm respectively. Only a small portion of that range is used in high-frequency 5G operation, and is defined in the US by the FCC as 24 GHz to 90 GHz.\\n\\nAs explained below in 5G Rollouts, for accuracy one must at least distinguish between 1) \\u2018small-cell\\u2019 infrastructure and 5G/small cells per se; 2) between 5G infrastructure and 5G high-frequency radiation; 3) between antennas and their enclosures, and **4) between high frequency 5G and mid-/low-band 5G, the signaling long used for 2G-4G iterations.\\n\\nNew terms are offered here for consistency and for clarifying hysteria-induced misunderstanding and confusion: \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d is a housing for antennas (sending/receiving elements). A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\nOne might see warnings such as: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSmall cell\\u201d is regularly misused, even by the Industry. Accurately speaking, a cell is not an antenna, but the effective area/range of an antenna\\u2019s radiation. 5Gmmw has a short range, which decreases with higher frequency. Thus, its cell is comparatively small.\\n\\nAlso, MMW can easily be blocked, even by even leaves and heavy rain, which deficiency increases with increasing frequency. Both drawbacks can be improved with a substantial power boost, but this also becomes a problem with energy cost and exposure levels, and so is not under consideration. Energy consumption is a major concern for the industry, which is feverishly at work to solve it.\\n\\nShort range and easy \\u2018blockability\\u2019 require more fixture locations, which hysteria frets about, rarely noting the distinction that 5Gmlb makes a large cell and is not blocked. Call it nitpicking if you will, but why not be accurate instead of creating misconception or \\u2018making cases\\u2019?\\n\\n\\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density, and common hysteria about how it will be implemented are in serious question (more later).\\n\\nOne interesting discovery came up while working on this article: Small cells are small but not new, and were not developed for 5G. Small cells have long been deployed in 3G and 4G networks and have become an industry choice to deliver MMW and enable better MLB performance if needed.\\n\\nTraditionally, there have been three types of small cells (more now), identified as they should be by antenna range. Some early deployments were in the US in 2007 and in the UK and Europe in 2009. \\u201cAccording to Small Cell Forum (who would have thought?), 18 million small cells had been deployed globally for various applications by the end of 2016.\\u201d\\n\\nBut haven\\u2019t we been led in a virtually deliberate way from the outset, and even continue to be, to think that 5G is small cells/MMW? Saying \\u201c5G\\u201d to indicate only these two things, or not specifying what you mean, is irresponsible, inaccurate, and misleading, as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nA 10/8/19 bulletin from Project Censored was forwarded to me via an email group that received it from Joel M. Moskowitz, PhD, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at UC Berkeley. A typically careless statement consisting of an error and a question mark says, \\u201cThe telecom industry is promoting the replacement of the current cellular network, known as 4G, with a new generation of higher frequency 5G wavelengths to power the \\u201cInternet of Things\\u2026\\u201d As a generalization, this is either shameful unawareness of the current scenario or untruth/propaganda, as we\\u2019ll also see.\\n\\n5G opposition also asserts that the skin\\u2019s (spiral) sweat ducts act as \\u201creceiving antennas.\\u201d This refers to an Israeli study, \\u201cThe human skin as a sub-THz receiver \\u2013 Does 5G pose a danger to it or not?\\u201d\\n\\nFrequency ranges don\\u2019t transition abruptly, but sub-THz usually means a range of 300 GHz down to 90, which is the upper end of FCC 5Gmmw.\\n\\nThe study Abstract uses two unquantified terms, \\u201csub-terahertz band\\u201d and \\u201csub-THz region.\\u201d I think \\u201cregion\\u201d is more accurate, meaning the range, or \\u201cspectrum\\u201d as understood in tech circles. \\u201cBand\\u201d is used to designate a single frequency, but also is an interval between a lower and upper frequency. For instance, a transmission between 40 and 50 MHz is a 10 MHz band (width).\\n\\nStudy frequencies were 75 GHz to 110 GHz. No wireless provider I\\u2019m aware of (in the US) has announced a mobile 5Gmmw service anywhere near 75 GHz. There was no explanation in the Abstract why announced commercial frequencies were not used.\\n\\nPower-level exposure limits at the user end are expressed in watts per area, usually square meter or square centimeter. No such levels are provided for the targets used, but maybe that\\u2019s not relevant in this case.\\n\\nThe highest commercial frequency I could find being tested is in the UK (though also approved for US), is 60 GHz. At least one rural test area is reportedly using a 60 GHz \\u201cwireless mesh\\u201d (interior network of interacting antennas) for \\u2018super WiFi.\\u2019 Not for mobile and still not up to 75 GHz.\\n\\nInteresting is that other UK rural testbeds are running unused TV bands called \\u201cTV white space\\u201d \\u2014 the old VHF to UHF frequencies, mostly MHz bands. This is 5G, mind you.\\n\\nHowever, bandwidths 71 to 76 GHz, 81 to 86 GHz and 92 to 95 GHz are available in the US for \\u201chigh-density\\u201d (high power) \\u201cfixed wireless access\\u201d services: \\u201c\\u2026the operation of wireless communication devices or systems used to connect two fixed locations (e.g., building to building or tower to building) with a radio or other wireless link\\u2026\\u201d, which would have to be line-of-sight and are not for mobile.\\n\\nAs noted, the higher the frequency, the greater are transmission challenges, so high-density bands would be very tight beams, with minimal to no obstacles and no human exposure (watch out, pigeons). Due to excess electricity consumption, MMW signals probably won\\u2019t be power boosted sufficiently to penetrate buildings, but be brought in via cable from an external receiver, then be distributed via a wireless network.\\n\\nStudy conclusion: \\u201cWe are raising a warning flag against the unrestricted use of sub-THz technologies for communication, before the possible consequences for public health are explored.\\u201d This seems sane enough \\u2013 within the insane context called wireless telecom/WiFi. See Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (needs updating).\\n\\nBut \\u201cunrestricted\\u201d at least suggests the impossible, that restrictions could prevent all trouble. Note also \\u201cpossible consequences.\\u201d This can\\u2019t be valid for harm in general, which is a fact long understood \\u2013 almost three decades before 2G came out (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\nWhen this warning is given, we don\\u2019t hear that the \\u201cwarning flag\\u201d would apply conceptually to all G\\u2019s; presumes there is a safe dose of MLB somewhere; and, as usual, neglects the ecosystem. But \\u2014 enough for protesters to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas? Making cases? I confess I fell for this one in my early research on wireless. A more likely, but still speculative, concern is discussed in Reports of \\u201c5G\\u201d Harm.\\n\\nAnother common warning, \\u201c5G is a weapon,\\u201d usually refers to the military\\u2019s Active Denial System, a \\u201cnon-lethal\\u201d microwave device for dispersing crowds by heating the skin. It\\u2019s a high density (power) millimeter wave at 95 GHz \\u2013 hardly commercial 5Gmmw.\\n\\nMMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G. Wireless telecom, beginning with 2G, is adapted stealth-weapon technology which uses very low power. The entire wireless system, not just \\u201c5G\\u201d, is a potential weapon on various levels (more below).\\n\\nAlso, high-enough density microwave \\u2014 at a \\u2018lowly\\u2019 2.5 GHz, for example \\u2014 will cook you like a microwave oven (2.45 GHz). That is, through and through, unlike ADS. At commercial power levels, 5Gmmw will not.\\n\\nA powerful Air Force radar system called Pave Paws at three US locations will cook you in a nanosecond at 420 to 450 MHz. Installations have two large circular arrays of antenna elements, each array radiating 580 kilowatts (!) It can detect a basketball at 12 miles, and small planes caught in the beam have blown up. So don\\u2019t swallow the rhetoric about telecom MMW weaponry.\\n\\nI was unable to find a range of ADS power output, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study calling out 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2) at 94 GHz (see Reports of Harm). ADS power is adjustable, however, enough to be used as a lethal weapon. But \\u2013 \\u2018making cases\\u2019 again?\\n\\nMicrowave ovens operate from 600 to 1200 watts. By comparison, maximum output of traditional cell towers is 10 watts \\u2013 phones, 2 watts. The higher frequency/shorter wavelength was chosen for ADS to limit penetration depth. Not saying that\\u2019s a good thing, not to mention it\\u2019s misleading (see Reports of Harm).\\n\\nFinding a wattage output figure for new, 5G MLB or MMW antennas proved fruitlessly time consuming (anyone?), but I did find a study establishing a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for a particular 5Gmmw antenna design for 28 and 38 GHz.\\n\\nSAR is an expression of how much radiation from a phone is absorbed over time by the body. It\\u2019s expressed in watts per kilogram (W/kg). Values were \\u201c\\u20260.37 and 1.34 W/kg [up to] 2 W/kg. Current FCC SAR standard is 1.6W/kg. This is given just for a sense of comparison, because SAR is useless for determining the amount of radiofrequency (RF) absorption in biosystems during typical conditions of use. See Safety Testing below.\\n\\nMany opposers suggest that 3G/4G/WiFi can be made reasonably safe. Others understand that impossibility, but seem too habituated and addicted to do the right thing. As noted in the Introduction, techno-humans are adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\n\\u201cNo \\u20185G\\u2019 safety studies have been conducted or funded by the Federal Communications Commission or the telecom industry, and none is planned.\\u201d Or simply, \\u201c5G has not been tested for safety\\u201d. Or the like. No such claims provide the facts.\\n\\nThat the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d terror, whereas, the real terror is wireless tech per se. Inherent in this ploy is the erroneous implication that 2G-4G were tested (a yes and no proposition).\\n\\nIn 1996, FCC adopted the standard identified as ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992. There were \\u2018window dressings\\u2019 in 2004, 2005, and 2010, and, like the original, covered frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019. (Overall \\u2018microwave\\u2019 is considered to be 300 MHz (.3 GHz) to 300 GHz.\\n\\nThe Commission\\u2019s assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is based on the fraudulent IEEE \\u2018testing\\u2019 it adopted in 1996 to run interference for 3G. That is, if the radiation doesn\\u2019t heat you, it can\\u2019t harm you.\\n\\nThis author warned of this response by FCC in February 2019 as \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria was powering up: Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised? Exposure limits worldwide are based on the ANSI/IEEE C95.1 fraud.\\n\\nPeer reviewed independent science, as early as the 1950s and still going, demonstrating myriad effects at non-heating levels, brings the integrity of C95.1-1992 through 2019 into question. Was *proper* testing ever done? Instead of clarifying this, hysteria makes the blanket claim. Making cases.\\n\\nThe FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science and such questions: \\u2018No convincing evidence exists, but we\\u2019re keeping an eye on it.\\u2019 The blatant criminality of the FCC with respect to wireless/EMF is clearly demonstrated by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nHysteria often resorts to another \\u2018ploy on words\\u2019 pertaining to 2G-4G, and used even by scientists, as seen near the end of this report: \\u201cThe current FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d The word implies that standards were at one time valid or sufficient, when they were never any such thing, for any living thing.\\n\\n\\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing has been demonstrated or can exist. Despite this, new limits are proposed and stubbornly called for \\u2014 in spite of the consensus that no safe level has even been published for fetuses.\\n\\nApparently, that\\u2019s not of sufficient concern to call for \\u201cStop Wireless Technology!\\u201d instead of \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d We\\u2019ll figure that fetus part out later.\\n\\nFor details on the original \\u2018safety\\u2019 testing \\u2013 scientific fraud, that is, on which power-level exposure limits worldwide are based \\u2013 see Sections Cell Phone Output and Exposure Limits for Users in the article Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\nMajor emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA,\\u2019 due to the short range and easy block-ability of MMW. But things seem to be developing differently for now, as we\\u2019ll see. As noted, even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\nThe following synthesis is the result of wading through too many articles to give credit to any one. Some sources tell varying stories about the same thing, and even disagree with each other considerably.\\n\\nSo here goes: A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard has been issued, specifying two frequency ranges: 5G NR bands FR1 & 5G NR bands FR2. Number one is for current bands below 6 GHz (5Gmlb), such as 600MHz, 1900MHz, and 2.5GHz; two is for MMW \\u2014 mostly 24 to 40 GHz for mobile, and higher for special applications (not mobile). In the near term, public WiFi will remain separate at MLB, 2.45 GHz and 5 GHz, but Verizon, for example, is offering 5Gmmw home internet/WiFi (not mobile) in limited areas of four cities.\\n\\n5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention at this point, including especially \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and \\u2018beamforming\\u2019 (more later).\\n\\nHowever, 5G NR FR1 can use the same towers as 4G, but will need new antennas. It has the same reach and penetration, but with shorter delay, while providing up to 35 percent more speed. The wireless addict\\u2019s dream. When you think about it, FR1 should really be 5G, and 5Gmmw, 6G.\\n\\nPlans are also in place for deployments using the unlicensed, Citizens Broadband Radio Service 3.5 GHz band, and all key players really want in. This is MLB called 5G, mind you.\\n\\nThings get a bit stickier when it comes to needing a new phone or not. Many current phones should be able to get updates to process FR1, but a new phone is needed for FR2. Generally, the \\u201ctech\\u201d advice is not to move yet, and here\\u2019s an example with Samsung\\u2019s $1300 5G Galaxy S10 being tested in Chicago (good shot of a 5Gmmw \\u201cnode\\u201d here).\\n\\nThe \\u201chold off\\u201d sentiment is conveyed also in this article. What it amounts to at this writing is that 5Gmmw is virtually at a \\u201cdemo\\u201d stage, not full coverage and service, even in town.\\n\\nMany \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers continue to use traditional 3G/4G/WiFi wireless, either knowing the danger or believing it\\u2019s safe, or will be, because they just want it. A possible motive driving hysteria?\\n\\nAnother possible motive for \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, or maybe just the effect it\\u2019s having, is to create a threat on the ground to draw resistance and to distract attention from the satellite program, a much more sinister development (see Examining Priorities below).\\n\\nThe disconnect about dangers brings up a story that drew wide attention at the time, especially in the UK, and one that seems to present a puzzle. It\\u2019s about the 6/26 2019 Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, Somerset County, England. It\\u2019s not strictly a \\u201crollout\\u201d story, more a system demo/test, but a decision was announced about installing \\u201c5G\\u201d network towers on festival grounds,\\n\\nDespite the fact that \\u201cGlastonbury officials [said] that move will allow festival attendees to access the Internet on their smartphones at faster speeds,\\u201d the announcement created a huge protest. In this story, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G are mentioned, but \\u201c5G\\u201d is not specified as MLB or MMW \\u2014 as anything, in other words. Is this hysteria-induced negligence?\\n\\nThe protest article is laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated one that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d. Even some much-admired professional associates/contacts promote this irresponsible notion. I must respectfully, but strongly, disagree, because the erroneous implication is that 2G-4G were/are not an experiment. Paradoxically, they were/are and were/are not experiments. Distinctions must be made (more below).\\n\\nConfusion again: \\u201cWhile obviously not many festival-goers are likely to have a \\u20185G\\u2019 phone by June, EE will be showing off what the network can do at its stand.\\u201d Once again, unspecified 5G. So, was the Glastonbury demo about 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb? Whatever, tickets sold out in less than 45 minutes.\\n\\nThe grand protest by potential attendees was both tragic and macabrely amusing: They were prepared to irradiate themselves constantly in huge numbers (up to 200,000 fans in attendance potentially using phones/smartphones), but fretted over \\u201c5G\\u201d, not even knowing it could have been their beloved 4G poison\\u2026reborn. Phone radiation is often overlooked.\\n\\nSimilarly, reports on the 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland clearly reflect the confusion and negligent use of \\u201c5G.\\u201d This Agence France-Presse story says, \\u201cBy early July, 334 antennae (sic) stations for 5G were operational across the country, authorities have told AFP.\\u201d Boy, watch out for authorities.\\n\\nAntenna location and density info aren\\u2019t revealed, but it could be urban or \\u2018near-urban.\\u2019 The number doesn\\u2019t seem to correspond to FLD in neighborhoods, but who knows, thanks to incomplete reporting (and perhaps misled authorities). The news reader is therefore in the dark about exactly what\\u2019s going on, but probably assumes it\\u2019s MMW. Due to\\u2026 \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s (but beginning much earlier). What was known then was later hushed in the runup to digital mobile telecom in 1991-2.\\n\\nThe decision was callously made long ago to put life/people at risk to have the technology (see History of Official Awareness below). Thus, the yes/no \\u201cexperiment\\u201d is not whether there will be harm from telecom/WiFi microwave, but the time window in which ongoing exposure damage \\u2014 across all frequencies and regardless of power level \\u2014 will manifest in a cascade of widespread intractable illness.\\n\\nNot to worry, though, that fate might be avoided: Ecosystem collapse could bring the house down beforehand. You might hear/see, \\u201cThe 5G race is on,\\u201d meaning market competition. The race of note, though, is between ecosystem collapse and human-health collapse.\\n\\nIn any case, here\\u2019s some of what\\u2019s happening in \\u2018real\\u2019 life. The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon. Carriers are choosing service areas for FR1, FR2 very carefully.\\n\\nT-Mobile has announced a nationwide 5Gmlb rollout at 600 MHz and an undisclosed application of \\u201c28 and 39\\u201d (see video), which means some 5Gmmw, almost certainly in cities.\\n\\nSprint\\u2019s plans are to run \\u201cLTE and 5G\\u201d simultaneously in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\nMentioned earlier, Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d (allegedly MMW \\u2013 5Gmmw) is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range to cover wide area\\u201d (5Gmlb), doesn\\u2019t say where.\\n\\nSacramento seems to be the most enthusiastic victim host for wireless. Here\\u2019s a gushing PR piece about a Verizon UWB installation at one Sacramento citizen\\u2019s home, with City officials attending. It features an external receiver. Sacramento also prides itself on opening the floodgates for \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more later).\\n\\nVerizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas, which could be its final destination. Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason. Ecocidal, terminally pathological 3G/4G still rages, again reflecting the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nThe forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. As noted earlier, drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for \\u201c18 million new\\u201d closely spaced fixtures nationwide. Given the above information on FR1 rollouts, there seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\nA report on new Qualcomm smartphone antennas supports the foregoing. It covers four bands between 26.5GHz and 40 GHz, but also antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 The QPM56xx RF module family works with the Snapdragon X50 modem to work in the sub-6GHz bands\\u2026\\u201d (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\nOne puzzle: It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) as specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs seem to disagree, saying 4G can handle IoT. Propaganda? Careless chatter? Who knows. It\\u2019s safe to assume, however, they refer to the new 4G/5Gmlb.\\n\\nSome opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. And the attempted widespread deployment of smart utility meters on 4G WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say. 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, because if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\nI didn\\u2019t bother spending the rest of my life trying to find if/where FLD installations are occurring. Anyone who\\u2019s seen close installations in any area, please share details in Comments.\\n\\nNow, if FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose. One, possibility of course, is optimized 5Gmlb performance, as in the past, although this shouldn\\u2019t often be necessary, due to the large cell and penetration of MLB.\\n\\nIn the entrained, FLD frame of mind, I was suspicious in Wireless Technology: \\u2026 (The 5G Locomotive section) of Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams\\u2019 statement in a 5/15/18 CNBC interview that antennas in your face is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019d say he was being coy, implying MLB, and being careful not to depict 5G accurately, since 5Gmmw must have increased FLD, while 5Gmlb, not for the most part.\\n\\nMcAdam touted 5Gmmw for smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality, all good reasons for planetary and health destruction. But remember, all the \\u201cSmart\\u201d out there now is WiFi, for which there is no 5Gmmw (although Verizon\\u2019s UWB Home Internet might qualify). \\u201cSmart\\u201d is the wireless tech word for monumentally stupid \\u2014 and for total surveillance and centralized coordination and control of daily life. See section The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026.\\n\\nNone of the above means things can\\u2019t change. It\\u2019s early. The MLB rollout could be just a prelude to an FLD/MMW invasion. If MMW gets a toe-hold and no one\\u2019s coming up provably sick, and people like it, it could weaken opposition and open floodgates.\\n\\nAnd there\\u2019s the question of how the many thousands of planned satellites (looking now like well more than 50,000) fit into the overall picture. Obviously, coverage comes immediately to mind, such as saturation in outlying areas? For IoT? One issue for satellites, though, is increased delay time (\\u201clatency\\u201d) due to distance. There could be a \\u2018division of labor\\u2019 among various services, such as ground for mobile and sats for entertainment.\\n\\nNote the promise of the nationwide sySTEMic programming to make kids into corporate plug-ins or hitech drones: \\u201cSTEM education emphasizes the value of a rigorous, interdisciplinary approach to education, allowing students to compete and succeed in a modern global marketplace.\\u201d How many dubious assumptions, claims and buzzwords in that PR flak?\\n\\nSTEM promises a wondrous, prosperous, techno-shiny future. It exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. In the developed world, the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum total of the latter. Speaking of which, once a city is immersed in \\u201csmart\\u201d tech, it\\u2019s likely to become a special target of hackers. Imagine the potential chaos.)\\n\\nThere have been various reports of adverse effects when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, almost certainly implying 5Gmmw. This would seem unlikely, virtually impossible, outside cities/populous areas.\\n\\nApparently, people see new infrastructure dense or not, or/and feel effects, and apparently assume MMW is in use, as we saw in the Bern example.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d harm stories consistently report symptoms existing before anyone even heard of 5G. Long before. All reported harms I\\u2019ve seen are classic 2G-4G symptoms, and mostly of the \\u2018Electrohypersensitivity\\u2019 type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\nRadiation/RF-level meters have been used to support claims. But RF meters don\\u2019t display frequencies, only power level within a range of frequencies. Ordinary meters, costing from around $120 to $400, top out at 8 GHz. 3G/4G mobile frequencies range from 600 megahertz to 2.5 GHz in the US, with 3.5 GHz coming. WiFi is 2.4 and 5 GHz. Recall, FCC defines 5Gmmw as 24 GHz to 90 GHz. Thus, current meters can\\u2019t read MMW.\\n\\nA true 5G phone would identify MMW (and MLB at this point). Professional (very expensive) meters cover low and high ranges into the upper GHz (I found one 10 MHz to 220 GHz), but also don\\u2019t display frequencies, so all frequencies present still couldn\\u2019t be identified.\\n\\nLong-term exposure, perhaps a cumulative effect, is playing into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Thus, if there is harm when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, what\\u2019s shown by existing meters? Not understood by victims and reporters? 4G, one way or another. Hysteria-induced confusion.\\n\\nOne hawker claims its meter can read \\u201c5G\\u201d based on the fact that two new MLB frequencies are used for 5G (mlb). Any old meter does this. This ruse brought to you by \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nMeters are interesting, but not really helpful for most people. Radiation is everywhere; no amount of exposure is safe; most bio-effects below heating are power-independent; and effects may be cumulative (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nA meter might come in handy for someone with outward symptoms and using some form of shielding, for example. It could be seen at what level symptoms abate \\u2013 which doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops. Most likely, it\\u2019s palliation, but it can still save much grief and help people function.\\n\\nWe can come to cautious conclusion about the frequency present by type of effect. Known effects of MMW (a limited volume of science, though growing) differ from MLB effects long reported in the voluminous dismissed science.\\n\\nMMW potentially threatens skin and eyes, but more effects are being reported, although sometimes \\u2018stretched.\\u2019 For example, a paper cited (in an article by a prominent scientist who must remain anonymous) to show that 5Gmmw impacts \\u201cheart rate variability\\u201d was a military directed-energy study (see Author Information) using 94 GHz at 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2). That\\u2019s essentially the \\u201cADS\\u201d system noted earlier.\\n\\nNot only is 75 mW 75 times the main FCC limit (limits vary with frequency), but 94 is a frequency higher than the upper limit of 5Gmmw defined by the FCC, and certainly wouldn\\u2019t be used in mobile applications. Making cases?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not that MMW can\\u2019t create MLB effects, but it\\u2019s a bit speculative at this point. It\\u2019s possible, however \\u201c\\u2026since nerves, blood vessels and other electrically conducting structures can carry radiation-induced currents deep into the body\\u201d (see section 5G is qualitatively and quantitatively different from 4G)\\n\\nAntenna technology called MIMO (pron. my-mo) has been around for about a decade now for MLB. The more recent development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, meaning many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming (and receiving) beams of radiation. It looks to be destined for both FR1 and FR2 (a virtual necessity for MMW). As noted, Sprint will use this at for 5G at 3.5 GHz.\\n\\nOne question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose an additional threat. It\\u2019s possible they have an effect different from traditional antennas. Also, it seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of many focused beams, although being immersed in a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\nIn any case, aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying a beam from point to point (line of sight) avoids high power output per beam, since penetration of intervening structures isn\\u2019t required.\\n\\nHysteria often warns of outrageously high power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d As noted, effects occur at all levels below heating, which is why 3G/4G need to go. And it would not behoove the industry for people to suddenly be suffering heat damage.\\n\\nDetails of several typical news reports follow. Most demonstrate the fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one shows a more general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\nThe story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from a Verizon antenna installed near the home illustrates confusion. The first video on this page shows testimony before the Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with the mayor present.\\n\\nThe type of antenna isn\\u2019t given. But it\\u2019s probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. We learned from the \\u201cgushing PR piece\\u201d cited in the 5G Rollouts section that Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strange that the testimony date precedes the stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests prior to the grand \\u201cunveiling,\\u201d so it could have been an early \\u201cHome\\u201d antenna. Or maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\nThe opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that ambiguous statement mean to the person who wrote it? To the viewer? The incident suggests harm (cold/flu symptoms) from 5Gmmw but still reinforces the importance of knowing what we mean when we say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\nThe mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although her prepared speech commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but the suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness, even though levels \\u201care still very high\\u201d will certainly be taken officially as \\u201ccorrelation,\\u201d not proof or even evidence.\\n\\nTypically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\nBottom line: Which 5G is present is academic, since the pre-\\u201c5G\\u201d endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal. Focus on \\u201c5G\\u201d is like fretting about a wildfire 10 miles away while your house is burning down.\\n\\nOne of the more outrageous opposition-induced hysterias in recent times is a story from Gateshead, a town in northern UK near the North Sea, that new LED street lights (no microwave fixtures on them, just the lights) were emitting \\u201c5G\\u201d and causing health issues. This was carelessly picked up by other outlets. No one gave a moment\\u2019s thought to the likelihood that it might be LED lights themselves.\\n\\nA news report from Cincinnati clearly demonstrates that folks are in the dark about what 5G is, thanks to hysteria. And a fairly well-known one from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, to its credit, shows a better general awareness of wireless threat. But both demonstrate questionable thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make them safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem).\\n\\nScroll down this page to see an RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story. Regardless of one\\u2019s opinion of RT, this one\\u2019s a great and accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\nThe original story from 9/20/19 (now includes an update) is a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria,\\u201d since no one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers up to this point. It involves a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that \\u201cpeople fear\\u201d will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d.\\n\\nThe 9/27/19 update shows a video interview with a concerned nurse, a conditioned \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacking understanding of the wireless threat. She\\u2019ll feel safer if that nasty tall tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\nThe tall, new-look tower with the cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video) is clearly not the massive MIMO 5Gmmw/small-cell type shown in the 5G-phone report in the 5G Rollouts section. That was Verizon\\u2019s.\\n\\nThe update also says the tower is Sprint\\u2019s. As noted, Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using massive MIMO. It being a Sprint tower, it\\u2019s not MMW. The \\u201c5G\\u201d fear was an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\nSo what\\u2019s in the cylindrical fixture? Could be 4G (LTE), 5Gmlb (\\u201c5G\\u201d), WiFi as well? WiMax? One question \\u2013 is it MIMO? Massive? Anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\nThe update notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are also popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman David Weissmann confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what? From what we\\u2019ve seen of Verizon, probably 5Gmlb, i.e., 4G LTE on FR1 steroids.\\n\\nThe San Joaquin report, from 3/12/19 also concerns a tall tower with a cylindrical fixture. But this isn\\u2019t about 5G, but about \\u201ca cell tower\\u201d being too close to an elementary school in Ripon with a \\u2018cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\n\\u201cAll in all, three teachers and four students have been battling various cancers since 2016,\\u201d as well as a 22-year-old former male student. Of course, those teachers and that young man \\u2018never\\u2019 used a wireless device, and never near that tower. Nor were they exposed to another tower or anyone else\\u2019s phone. This doesn\\u2019t seem to dawn on people.\\n\\nThe Ripon case is interesting. An independent expert was consulted, who contradicted official assurance that the tower tested within federal standards. He said he wouldn\\u2019t send his kids there, because kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed \\u2013 as if they\\u2019re not exposed 24/7 anywhere a phone/tower system is working, not only from towers, but many phones as well. And does he think that once you\\u2019re \\u201cdeveloped\\u201d it\\u2019s OK?\\n\\nSprint subsequently shut it down and agreed to relocate, guilty or not. The move was good PR, and indicates that companies and municipalities will back down \\u2013 probably to avoid litigation, since that could open floodgates.\\n\\nRipon is important for two more reasons. The first is the usually overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure (see History of Official Awareness below). It\\u2019s well known, for example, that effects from cigarette tobacco and ionizing radiation (like a hospital X-ray), are cumulative. There\\u2019s no reason wireless radiation should be any different.\\n\\nMost kids are heavily exposed in our wireless world, wherever they are \\u2013 many from conception, and even before that, especially to ovarian DNA damage. This is one egregious crime of the technology.\\n\\nThe second reason is the bogus advice that \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the false argument for slow death over quicker death, or the futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can even make things worse. The farther the source, the greater are reflection and refraction of signals, creating a far more chaotic condition for the body to handle. Any telecom/WiFi antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\nReducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usually usage tips but also lower exposure limits. Despite calls for the latter, it holds mostly for heating. For non-heating effects, lower power could even increase the threat, since there\\u2019s a good chance that the closer we get to the minute power levels used by biosystems for intercellular communication, a greater confusion sets in.\\n\\nWith regard to usage tips, \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures accumulate over time to engender serious disease \\u2013 of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem, whose damage these clever warnings for humans worsen.\\n\\nThe problem is that reliance on power level alone to determine safety is largely a convenience (there\\u2019s that fatal word again), not science. The reader doesn\\u2019t need to understand the following terms, just that there are several factors in play, including whether the signal is continuous or pulsed, the shape of the pulsations, the rise time, fall time and duration of the pulsations, the type and depth of modulation, the frequencies, and the bandwidth.\\n\\nTry to set a \\u201csafe\\u201d exposure limit based on all that. So they keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\nA corollary is that folks claiming harm seem to think it\\u2019s for the first time. This is fatal error. There are also stories wherein people or animals affected by, say, a Smart meter, regard symptom abatement when the meter is removed as complete recovery. More fatal error. People have no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway. By now, the reader should know why.\\n\\nAn Idaho organization, ehsidaho.com, collects reports on the incidence and effects of what\\u2019s being called electrohypersensitivity, or EHS. The term is misleading, because no living thing is unaffected by the radiation, whether it manifests outwardly or not. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 is suggested.\\n\\nAn estimated 35% of the population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\nClaire Edwards, a former UN staffer, top writer and wireless activist said to me in an email that an estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. The rest of society is virtually thumbing its nose at these unfortunate people. But they\\u2019ll also suffer if this red flag is ignored: As bad as this sensitivity is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad, either in incidence or severity, as things could quickly and easily get.\\n\\nIllness caused by wireless radiation is not new or unique to it, even though there are lists and categories of issues attributed to it. In medicine, a symptom can be caused by any number of influences, and a single influence can cause various symptoms.\\n\\nSo a big question is, how much of today\\u2019s ongoing ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 that is, defined and named prior to the wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to telecom/WiFi radiation (or even the whole radiation gamut to which we expose ourselves)?\\n\\nIf officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\nThus even for EMF-sick users \\u2014 who are much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors (oblivious) attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\nBut quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 is what must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\nManifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere (see The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026).\\n\\nIf we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\nOf the several historical documents acknowledging the deleterious effects of artificial electromagnetic fields denied by FCC, the definitive one for wireless tech seems to be a 1981 World Health Organization (WHO) report entitled Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973. (I\\u2019ve always thought it unfortunate and instructive that \\u201cenvironmental health\\u201d is not about techno-human torment of Earth, but concern about just payback for the tormentor).\\n\\nThe report is long, covering many aspects. It covers all telecom/WiFi frequencies, including MMW; but real-world harm for the last three decades has come, and continues from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\nAs forthright as the WHO publication purports to be, the Summary reveals a distressing ruthlessness. It\\u2019s all most people need to read to understand that \\u2018they\\u2019 knew. For reader convenience, a brief review follows.\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.3 Biological effects in experimental animals: It has been demonstrated that low-level, long-term exposure may induce effects in the nervous, haematopoietic (production of blood cells and platelets), and immuno-competent cell systems of animals. Such effects have been reported in small animals (rodents) exposed to incident power density levels as low as 0.1-1.0 mW/cm2\\u201d (\\u201cmW\\u201d = milliwatt \\u2013 one thousandth of a watt). So this is one tenth of one thousandth of a watt to one thousandth of a watt per square centimeter. FCC limit: one thousandth of a watt \\u2013 1 mW/cm2 (for frequencies 1500 MHz \\u2013 100 GHz).\\n\\n\\u201cThe reported effects on the nervous system include behavioural, bioelectrical, metabolic, and structural (at the cellular and subcellular levels) changes. Erythrocyte production and haemaglobin synthesis may be impaired and immunological reactivity changed.\\u201d OK so far (except for exploiting/hurting animals).\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.6: Health risk evaluation as a basis for exposure limits: \\u2026 A highly conservative approach would be to keep exposure limits close to natural background levels. However, this is not technically feasible [emphasis added]. A reasonable risk-benefit analysis has to be considered.\\u201d\\n\\nIs \\u201chighly conservative\\u201d a euphemism for \\u201csafe\\u201d? And what does \\u201cclose\\u201d mean? In any case, the \\u201cbackground level,\\u201c called the cosmic background is 0.0000000001 \\u2013 0.000000000000001 \\u00b5W/cm2 (\\u00b5W = microwatt \\u2013 one millionth of a watt). Thus, the higher background limit (first one) is one ten billionth of a millionth of a watt (sounds like just a few electrons to me \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nFCC limit is on the other side of the decimal point at 1000 \\u00b5W/cm2. a thousand millionths of a watt \\u2013 per square centimeter, that is. Frankly, the author\\u2019s head goes into a spin with these minuscule decimals, but it\\u2019s safe to say there\\u2019s a bit of a margin between FCC and Cosmos \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nThe FCC limit is outrageous even compared to the most conservative proposed \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit: .003 \\u2013 .006 \\u00b5W/cm2. and the BioInitiative Report authors say it might even need to be lower..\\n\\nImportantly, however, the cosmic variety is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed). That means there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limit after all: zero.\\n\\n\\u201cNot technically feasible\\u201d? Well, of course. Technology is more important than health in some minds. \\u201cReasonable risk-benefit\\u201d? The Summary doesn\\u2019t say how many sick or dead per million is reasonable. (Please see also)\\n\\nOne wonders if they were aware of earlier studies, referred to by Andrew Michrowski, PhD at the 2009 Toronto Whole Life Expo (see section, Key Testimony in Toronto in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMichrowski interprets the data for us: \\u201cAnalysis of 1950 -1974 mortality of 40,000 Korean War veterans shows that microwave exposure effect is cumulative [emphasis added] it affects all deaths \\u2026 doubling to tripling cancers of eye, brain and central nervous system, lymphatic and hematopoietic [blood-cell/platelet-forming] and digestive systems. This means that even \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures from wireless systems accumulate over the years and decades to engender serious diseases\\u201d (can\\u2019t be said too often).\\n\\nNor do we know if the Warsaw International Symposium or its WHO reviewers were aware that the US military and others conducted microwave stealth-weapon research in the 1950s. This technology became 2G. See Sections Assault: From Weapon to Telecom and Ultimate Atrocity in the Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nOpposition warnings frequently emphasize \\u2018protecting you and your family.\\u2019 The point having been made several times is worth repeating: The most dire threat is to the ecosystem, not humans. No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\nEnvironment usually suffers in the background of hysteria. One will see lists something like this: \\u201chealth, privacy, security, and the environment.\\u201d\\n\\nThose who offer exposure \\u201csolutions\\u201d or \\u201ctips\\u201d seem to forget that no form or amount of human protection does so for Nature. A false sense of security in being \\u201csafer\\u201d leads to continued use and support of the overall system, immeasurably intensifying that threat.\\n\\nInsects, for example, are highly susceptible to telecom/WiFi microwave, especially to MMW, which we haven\\u2019t even had yet. In the last quarter century or so, coinciding closely with the introduction of 2G, 75% of the biomass of insects has disappeared in otherwise protected areas in Germany. Meaning it\\u2019s probably worse where other threats co-exist.\\n\\nEmphatically: The wireless threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. We need to look at the context of wireless, which is technology, per se. And one thing is certain about most of that, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\nIn almost all cases, somewhere along the line from resource acquisition (especially mining) to manufacture, use, and disposal, advanced technology is chemically/energetically toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless encompasses the entire line of a process of Earth liquidation/sacrifice for human \\u201cneeds\\u201d \\u2013 money, convenience, and entertainment (see section The Price of Techno-Civilization in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMoving to \\u201cwired\\u201d telecom/WiFi will not stop this assault. Countries are under siege for resources. Nor will the Elite psyops \\u201cSustainable Development\\u201d and \\u201cClean Renewable Energy\\u201d stop it. But that\\u2019s another article.\\n\\nThe attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed. I ask that anyone who can name a major environmental or health crisis in which technology isn\\u2019t the cause or doesn\\u2019t play a major role, comment about it.\\n\\nLooking at the overall output of \\u201cconcerned\\u201d EMF scientists and activists, however, if one isn\\u2019t careful, one could conclude it\\u2019s thought that humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\nAnother major concern is disproportionate attention on local antennas, while a massive satellite program proceeds. At one point, up to 20,000 satellites were planned to blanket the globe. But the number keeps growing.\\n\\nMadman Elon Musk\\u2019s SpaceX had dibs on 12,000 for 5Gmmw. Here is news that Madman is applying for 30,000 more. Just 42,000 satellites will be about 5 times the total spacecraft launched since 1957 (8,500).\\n\\nSeveral other companies, including Boeing, OneWeb, Amazon, Facebook, not to mention Russia and China, mean many thousands more. Total madness could bring it to somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000. This considered sane. Why? Because insanity unrecognized as such has become the norm in the culture of toxic-technomasturbation.\\n\\nPollution. Some 150 tons of refined kerosene and 340 tons of liquid oxygen per Musk 5G launch (60 satellites, 400 kg each). Do the math, even for 12,000. There seems to be no concern for consequences, such as potential damage to the ozone layer, major interference with earth\\u2019s energy field, or even increased atmospheric CO2 (for the faithful). Not to mention, decline of breathable free oxygen (very cool dynamic graph).\\n\\nMuch seems to be up in the air on the satellite program. Since launches proceed in haste, the plan seems to be shoot them up first, answer proprietary questions later, dismissing anyone else\\u2019s. In Europe, there are currently calls for papers on satellite integration with 5G, with submissions deadline being the Ides of March 2020.\\n\\nNASA, NOAA, meteorologists, (and radio astronomers) have issued valid concerns about MMW. FCC has dismissed them, too. Yet, NASA intends to participate in this bit of insanity.\\n\\nMight such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates? Insane is a good word for it, but psychopathic puts a more specific tag on it. See subsections Same Old Story\\u2026 and \\u2026with a Twist in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nThe best way to beat 5G, on the ground at least, is to quit wireless tech flat. Little demand \\u2018down here\\u2019 could greatly reduce incentive to invest \\u2018up there\\u2019. If there is a total-surveillance and human-control system gestating in the technosphere, how much of a role could satellites play?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strongly suggested that an outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the one on earthbound antennas.\\n\\nTaking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\nAgain, a race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse. Allowing classic 4G (or even just 5G FR1) to continue potentiates imminent disaster. Both scenarios are in progress, but at the \\u2018deniable\\u2019 stage. When \\u2018undeniable\\u2019 sets in, the slope will almost certainly have become too steep and slippery.\\n\\nExperience shows that science-based appeals, to governments at all levels; to national and international regulatory bodies, and so on is an exercise in futility due to multiple factors, including corruption, disbelief, and intimidation. Old and chronic conditions.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s in the People\\u2019s hands now, at the commercial level. Either common sense prevails over addiction and selfishness, or we wait for the race to end and hope it\\u2019s not too late.\\n\\nGive up wireless per se or give up the future \\u2013 liberty first, then life. If not, then welcome all 5G, especially the satellites. Surrender to it will mercifully shorten the coming agony.\\n\\nPeter Tocci is a retired massage therapist and wellness consultant with an abiding interest in exploring \\u2018managed\\u2019 history, nefarious covert agendas, and mainstream/mainstream-alternative news-media dereliction, distortion and suppression.

Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more like hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts.

A Bullet Summary for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose detail, and a Text Summary, for those who want a more general sweep. Both provide means for quickly accessing areas of particular interest. But reading the full text is strongly encouraged. A small number of revisions might not appear in the Summaries.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\nWithout any help from \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers, the \\u201cnext generation\\u201d wireless is very dangerous \\u2014 all by itself \\u2014 as is each previous G by itself. But due to hysteria (illogic, inaccuracies and omissions), most opposition is also dangerous by itself.\\n\\nNot much has changed since this PC Mag article was published in 1/2019. And that doesn\\u2019t cover all critical aspects.\\n\\nConfusion begins right off the bat with the term \\u201c5G.\\u201d It\\u2019s being flung carelessly about, in articles, protests, news reports, corporate bulletins, by politicians \\u2013 even by scientists, and in submissions and comments to official bodies.\\n\\nAlmost always implied when \\u201c5G\\u201d is uttered \\u2013 especially, \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d or \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d \\u2013 is use of the \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This causes misunderstanding and potential danger.\\n\\nOverall, EHF is specified as 30 GHz to 300 GHz, and wavelength 10 millimeters to 1mm respectively. Only a small portion of that range is used in high-frequency 5G operation, and is defined in the US by the FCC as 24 GHz to 90 GHz.\\n\\nAs explained below in 5G Rollouts, for accuracy one must at least distinguish between 1) \\u2018small-cell\\u2019 infrastructure and 5G/small cells per se; 2) between 5G infrastructure and 5G high-frequency radiation; 3) between antennas and their enclosures, and **4) between high frequency 5G and mid-/low-band 5G, the signaling long used for 2G-4G iterations.\\n\\nNew terms are offered here for consistency and for clarifying hysteria-induced misunderstanding and confusion: \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d is a housing for antennas (sending/receiving elements). A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\nOne might see warnings such as: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSmall cell\\u201d is regularly misused, even by the Industry. Accurately speaking, a cell is not an antenna, but the effective area/range of an antenna\\u2019s radiation. 5Gmmw has a short range, which decreases with higher frequency. Thus, its cell is comparatively small.\\n\\nAlso, MMW can easily be blocked, even by even leaves and heavy rain, which deficiency increases with increasing frequency. Both drawbacks can be improved with a substantial power boost, but this also becomes a problem with energy cost and exposure levels, and so is not under consideration. Energy consumption is a major concern for the industry, which is feverishly at work to solve it.\\n\\nShort range and easy \\u2018blockability\\u2019 require more fixture locations, which hysteria frets about, rarely noting the distinction that 5Gmlb makes a large cell and is not blocked. Call it nitpicking if you will, but why not be accurate instead of creating misconception or \\u2018making cases\\u2019?\\n\\n\\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density, and common hysteria about how it will be implemented are in serious question (more later).\\n\\nOne interesting discovery came up while working on this article: Small cells are small but not new, and were not developed for 5G. Small cells have long been deployed in 3G and 4G networks and have become an industry choice to deliver MMW and enable better MLB performance if needed.\\n\\nTraditionally, there have been three types of small cells (more now), identified as they should be by antenna range. Some early deployments were in the US in 2007 and in the UK and Europe in 2009. \\u201cAccording to Small Cell Forum (who would have thought?), 18 million small cells had been deployed globally for various applications by the end of 2016.\\u201d\\n\\nBut haven\\u2019t we been led in a virtually deliberate way from the outset, and even continue to be, to think that 5G is small cells/MMW? Saying \\u201c5G\\u201d to indicate only these two things, or not specifying what you mean, is irresponsible, inaccurate, and misleading, as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nA 10/8/19 bulletin from Project Censored was forwarded to me via an email group that received it from Joel M. Moskowitz, PhD, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at UC Berkeley. A typically careless statement consisting of an error and a question mark says, \\u201cThe telecom industry is promoting the replacement of the current cellular network, known as 4G, with a new generation of higher frequency 5G wavelengths to power the \\u201cInternet of Things\\u2026\\u201d As a generalization, this is either shameful unawareness of the current scenario or untruth/propaganda, as we\\u2019ll also see.\\n\\n5G opposition also asserts that the skin\\u2019s (spiral) sweat ducts act as \\u201creceiving antennas.\\u201d This refers to an Israeli study, \\u201cThe human skin as a sub-THz receiver \\u2013 Does 5G pose a danger to it or not?\\u201d\\n\\nFrequency ranges don\\u2019t transition abruptly, but sub-THz usually means a range of 300 GHz down to 90, which is the upper end of FCC 5Gmmw.\\n\\nThe study Abstract uses two unquantified terms, \\u201csub-terahertz band\\u201d and \\u201csub-THz region.\\u201d I think \\u201cregion\\u201d is more accurate, meaning the range, or \\u201cspectrum\\u201d as understood in tech circles. \\u201cBand\\u201d is used to designate a single frequency, but also is an interval between a lower and upper frequency. For instance, a transmission between 40 and 50 MHz is a 10 MHz band (width).\\n\\nStudy frequencies were 75 GHz to 110 GHz. No wireless provider I\\u2019m aware of (in the US) has announced a mobile 5Gmmw service anywhere near 75 GHz. There was no explanation in the Abstract why announced commercial frequencies were not used.\\n\\nPower-level exposure limits at the user end are expressed in watts per area, usually square meter or square centimeter. No such levels are provided for the targets used, but maybe that\\u2019s not relevant in this case.\\n\\nThe highest commercial frequency I could find being tested is in the UK (though also approved for US), is 60 GHz. At least one rural test area is reportedly using a 60 GHz \\u201cwireless mesh\\u201d (interior network of interacting antennas) for \\u2018super WiFi.\\u2019 Not for mobile and still not up to 75 GHz.\\n\\nInteresting is that other UK rural testbeds are running unused TV bands called \\u201cTV white space\\u201d \\u2014 the old VHF to UHF frequencies, mostly MHz bands. This is 5G, mind you.\\n\\nHowever, bandwidths 71 to 76 GHz, 81 to 86 GHz and 92 to 95 GHz are available in the US for \\u201chigh-density\\u201d (high power) \\u201cfixed wireless access\\u201d services: \\u201c\\u2026the operation of wireless communication devices or systems used to connect two fixed locations (e.g., building to building or tower to building) with a radio or other wireless link\\u2026\\u201d, which would have to be line-of-sight and are not for mobile.\\n\\nAs noted, the higher the frequency, the greater are transmission challenges, so high-density bands would be very tight beams, with minimal to no obstacles and no human exposure (watch out, pigeons). Due to excess electricity consumption, MMW signals probably won\\u2019t be power boosted sufficiently to penetrate buildings, but be brought in via cable from an external receiver, then be distributed via a wireless network.\\n\\nStudy conclusion: \\u201cWe are raising a warning flag against the unrestricted use of sub-THz technologies for communication, before the possible consequences for public health are explored.\\u201d This seems sane enough \\u2013 within the insane context called wireless telecom/WiFi. See Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (needs updating).\\n\\nBut \\u201cunrestricted\\u201d at least suggests the impossible, that restrictions could prevent all trouble. Note also \\u201cpossible consequences.\\u201d This can\\u2019t be valid for harm in general, which is a fact long understood \\u2013 almost three decades before 2G came out (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\nWhen this warning is given, we don\\u2019t hear that the \\u201cwarning flag\\u201d would apply conceptually to all G\\u2019s; presumes there is a safe dose of MLB somewhere; and, as usual, neglects the ecosystem. But \\u2014 enough for protesters to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas? Making cases? I confess I fell for this one in my early research on wireless. A more likely, but still speculative, concern is discussed in Reports of \\u201c5G\\u201d Harm.\\n\\nAnother common warning, \\u201c5G is a weapon,\\u201d usually refers to the military\\u2019s Active Denial System, a \\u201cnon-lethal\\u201d microwave device for dispersing crowds by heating the skin. It\\u2019s a high density (power) millimeter wave at 95 GHz \\u2013 hardly commercial 5Gmmw.\\n\\nMMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G. Wireless telecom, beginning with 2G, is adapted stealth-weapon technology which uses very low power. The entire wireless system, not just \\u201c5G\\u201d, is a potential weapon on various levels (more below).\\n\\nAlso, high-enough density microwave \\u2014 at a \\u2018lowly\\u2019 2.5 GHz, for example \\u2014 will cook you like a microwave oven (2.45 GHz). That is, through and through, unlike ADS. At commercial power levels, 5Gmmw will not.\\n\\nA powerful Air Force radar system called Pave Paws at three US locations will cook you in a nanosecond at 420 to 450 MHz. Installations have two large circular arrays of antenna elements, each array radiating 580 kilowatts (!) It can detect a basketball at 12 miles, and small planes caught in the beam have blown up. So don\\u2019t swallow the rhetoric about telecom MMW weaponry.\\n\\nI was unable to find a range of ADS power output, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study calling out 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2) at 94 GHz (see Reports of Harm). ADS power is adjustable, however, enough to be used as a lethal weapon. But \\u2013 \\u2018making cases\\u2019 again?\\n\\nMicrowave ovens operate from 600 to 1200 watts. By comparison, maximum output of traditional cell towers is 10 watts \\u2013 phones, 2 watts. The higher frequency/shorter wavelength was chosen for ADS to limit penetration depth. Not saying that\\u2019s a good thing, not to mention it\\u2019s misleading (see Reports of Harm).\\n\\nFinding a wattage output figure for new, 5G MLB or MMW antennas proved fruitlessly time consuming (anyone?), but I did find a study establishing a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for a particular 5Gmmw antenna design for 28 and 38 GHz.\\n\\nSAR is an expression of how much radiation from a phone is absorbed over time by the body. It\\u2019s expressed in watts per kilogram (W/kg). Values were \\u201c\\u20260.37 and 1.34 W/kg [up to] 2 W/kg. Current FCC SAR standard is 1.6W/kg. This is given just for a sense of comparison, because SAR is useless for determining the amount of radiofrequency (RF) absorption in biosystems during typical conditions of use. See Safety Testing below.\\n\\nMany opposers suggest that 3G/4G/WiFi can be made reasonably safe. Others understand that impossibility, but seem too habituated and addicted to do the right thing. As noted in the Introduction, techno-humans are adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\n\\u201cNo \\u20185G\\u2019 safety studies have been conducted or funded by the Federal Communications Commission or the telecom industry, and none is planned.\\u201d Or simply, \\u201c5G has not been tested for safety\\u201d. Or the like. No such claims provide the facts.\\n\\nThat the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d terror, whereas, the real terror is wireless tech per se. Inherent in this ploy is the erroneous implication that 2G-4G were tested (a yes and no proposition).\\n\\nIn 1996, FCC adopted the standard identified as ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992. There were \\u2018window dressings\\u2019 in 2004, 2005, and 2010, and, like the original, covered frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019. (Overall \\u2018microwave\\u2019 is considered to be 300 MHz (.3 GHz) to 300 GHz.\\n\\nThe Commission\\u2019s assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is based on the fraudulent IEEE \\u2018testing\\u2019 it adopted in 1996 to run interference for 3G. That is, if the radiation doesn\\u2019t heat you, it can\\u2019t harm you.\\n\\nThis author warned of this response by FCC in February 2019 as \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria was powering up: Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised? Exposure limits worldwide are based on the ANSI/IEEE C95.1 fraud.\\n\\nPeer reviewed independent science, as early as the 1950s and still going, demonstrating myriad effects at non-heating levels, brings the integrity of C95.1-1992 through 2019 into question. Was *proper* testing ever done? Instead of clarifying this, hysteria makes the blanket claim. Making cases.\\n\\nThe FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science and such questions: \\u2018No convincing evidence exists, but we\\u2019re keeping an eye on it.\\u2019 The blatant criminality of the FCC with respect to wireless/EMF is clearly demonstrated by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nHysteria often resorts to another \\u2018ploy on words\\u2019 pertaining to 2G-4G, and used even by scientists, as seen near the end of this report: \\u201cThe current FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d The word implies that standards were at one time valid or sufficient, when they were never any such thing, for any living thing.\\n\\n\\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing has been demonstrated or can exist. Despite this, new limits are proposed and stubbornly called for \\u2014 in spite of the consensus that no safe level has even been published for fetuses.\\n\\nApparently, that\\u2019s not of sufficient concern to call for \\u201cStop Wireless Technology!\\u201d instead of \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d We\\u2019ll figure that fetus part out later.\\n\\nFor details on the original \\u2018safety\\u2019 testing \\u2013 scientific fraud, that is, on which power-level exposure limits worldwide are based \\u2013 see Sections Cell Phone Output and Exposure Limits for Users in the article Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\nMajor emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA,\\u2019 due to the short range and easy block-ability of MMW. But things seem to be developing differently for now, as we\\u2019ll see. As noted, even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\nThe following synthesis is the result of wading through too many articles to give credit to any one. Some sources tell varying stories about the same thing, and even disagree with each other considerably.\\n\\nSo here goes: A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard has been issued, specifying two frequency ranges: 5G NR bands FR1 & 5G NR bands FR2. Number one is for current bands below 6 GHz (5Gmlb), such as 600MHz, 1900MHz, and 2.5GHz; two is for MMW \\u2014 mostly 24 to 40 GHz for mobile, and higher for special applications (not mobile). In the near term, public WiFi will remain separate at MLB, 2.45 GHz and 5 GHz, but Verizon, for example, is offering 5Gmmw home internet/WiFi (not mobile) in limited areas of four cities.\\n\\n5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention at this point, including especially \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and \\u2018beamforming\\u2019 (more later).\\n\\nHowever, 5G NR FR1 can use the same towers as 4G, but will need new antennas. It has the same reach and penetration, but with shorter delay, while providing up to 35 percent more speed. The wireless addict\\u2019s dream. When you think about it, FR1 should really be 5G, and 5Gmmw, 6G.\\n\\nPlans are also in place for deployments using the unlicensed, Citizens Broadband Radio Service 3.5 GHz band, and all key players really want in. This is MLB called 5G, mind you.\\n\\nThings get a bit stickier when it comes to needing a new phone or not. Many current phones should be able to get updates to process FR1, but a new phone is needed for FR2. Generally, the \\u201ctech\\u201d advice is not to move yet, and here\\u2019s an example with Samsung\\u2019s $1300 5G Galaxy S10 being tested in Chicago (good shot of a 5Gmmw \\u201cnode\\u201d here).\\n\\nThe \\u201chold off\\u201d sentiment is conveyed also in this article. What it amounts to at this writing is that 5Gmmw is virtually at a \\u201cdemo\\u201d stage, not full coverage and service, even in town.\\n\\nMany \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers continue to use traditional 3G/4G/WiFi wireless, either knowing the danger or believing it\\u2019s safe, or will be, because they just want it. A possible motive driving hysteria?\\n\\nAnother possible motive for \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, or maybe just the effect it\\u2019s having, is to create a threat on the ground to draw resistance and to distract attention from the satellite program, a much more sinister development (see Examining Priorities below).\\n\\nThe disconnect about dangers brings up a story that drew wide attention at the time, especially in the UK, and one that seems to present a puzzle. It\\u2019s about the 6/26 2019 Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, Somerset County, England. It\\u2019s not strictly a \\u201crollout\\u201d story, more a system demo/test, but a decision was announced about installing \\u201c5G\\u201d network towers on festival grounds,\\n\\nDespite the fact that \\u201cGlastonbury officials [said] that move will allow festival attendees to access the Internet on their smartphones at faster speeds,\\u201d the announcement created a huge protest. In this story, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G are mentioned, but \\u201c5G\\u201d is not specified as MLB or MMW \\u2014 as anything, in other words. Is this hysteria-induced negligence?\\n\\nThe protest article is laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated one that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d. Even some much-admired professional associates/contacts promote this irresponsible notion. I must respectfully, but strongly, disagree, because the erroneous implication is that 2G-4G were/are not an experiment. Paradoxically, they were/are and were/are not experiments. Distinctions must be made (more below).\\n\\nConfusion again: \\u201cWhile obviously not many festival-goers are likely to have a \\u20185G\\u2019 phone by June, EE will be showing off what the network can do at its stand.\\u201d Once again, unspecified 5G. So, was the Glastonbury demo about 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb? Whatever, tickets sold out in less than 45 minutes.\\n\\nThe grand protest by potential attendees was both tragic and macabrely amusing: They were prepared to irradiate themselves constantly in huge numbers (up to 200,000 fans in attendance potentially using phones/smartphones), but fretted over \\u201c5G\\u201d, not even knowing it could have been their beloved 4G poison\\u2026reborn. Phone radiation is often overlooked.\\n\\nSimilarly, reports on the 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland clearly reflect the confusion and negligent use of \\u201c5G.\\u201d This Agence France-Presse story says, \\u201cBy early July, 334 antennae (sic) stations for 5G were operational across the country, authorities have told AFP.\\u201d Boy, watch out for authorities.\\n\\nAntenna location and density info aren\\u2019t revealed, but it could be urban or \\u2018near-urban.\\u2019 The number doesn\\u2019t seem to correspond to FLD in neighborhoods, but who knows, thanks to incomplete reporting (and perhaps misled authorities). The news reader is therefore in the dark about exactly what\\u2019s going on, but probably assumes it\\u2019s MMW. Due to\\u2026 \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s (but beginning much earlier). What was known then was later hushed in the runup to digital mobile telecom in 1991-2.\\n\\nThe decision was callously made long ago to put life/people at risk to have the technology (see History of Official Awareness below). Thus, the yes/no \\u201cexperiment\\u201d is not whether there will be harm from telecom/WiFi microwave, but the time window in which ongoing exposure damage \\u2014 across all frequencies and regardless of power level \\u2014 will manifest in a cascade of widespread intractable illness.\\n\\nNot to worry, though, that fate might be avoided: Ecosystem collapse could bring the house down beforehand. You might hear/see, \\u201cThe 5G race is on,\\u201d meaning market competition. The race of note, though, is between ecosystem collapse and human-health collapse.\\n\\nIn any case, here\\u2019s some of what\\u2019s happening in \\u2018real\\u2019 life. The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon. Carriers are choosing service areas for FR1, FR2 very carefully.\\n\\nT-Mobile has announced a nationwide 5Gmlb rollout at 600 MHz and an undisclosed application of \\u201c28 and 39\\u201d (see video), which means some 5Gmmw, almost certainly in cities.\\n\\nSprint\\u2019s plans are to run \\u201cLTE and 5G\\u201d simultaneously in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\nMentioned earlier, Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d (allegedly MMW \\u2013 5Gmmw) is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range to cover wide area\\u201d (5Gmlb), doesn\\u2019t say where.\\n\\nSacramento seems to be the most enthusiastic victim host for wireless. Here\\u2019s a gushing PR piece about a Verizon UWB installation at one Sacramento citizen\\u2019s home, with City officials attending. It features an external receiver. Sacramento also prides itself on opening the floodgates for \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more later).\\n\\nVerizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas, which could be its final destination. Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason. Ecocidal, terminally pathological 3G/4G still rages, again reflecting the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nThe forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. As noted earlier, drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for \\u201c18 million new\\u201d closely spaced fixtures nationwide. Given the above information on FR1 rollouts, there seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\nA report on new Qualcomm smartphone antennas supports the foregoing. It covers four bands between 26.5GHz and 40 GHz, but also antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 The QPM56xx RF module family works with the Snapdragon X50 modem to work in the sub-6GHz bands\\u2026\\u201d (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\nOne puzzle: It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) as specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs seem to disagree, saying 4G can handle IoT. Propaganda? Careless chatter? Who knows. It\\u2019s safe to assume, however, they refer to the new 4G/5Gmlb.\\n\\nSome opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. And the attempted widespread deployment of smart utility meters on 4G WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say. 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, because if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\nI didn\\u2019t bother spending the rest of my life trying to find if/where FLD installations are occurring. Anyone who\\u2019s seen close installations in any area, please share details in Comments.\\n\\nNow, if FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose. One, possibility of course, is optimized 5Gmlb performance, as in the past, although this shouldn\\u2019t often be necessary, due to the large cell and penetration of MLB.\\n\\nIn the entrained, FLD frame of mind, I was suspicious in Wireless Technology: \\u2026 (The 5G Locomotive section) of Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams\\u2019 statement in a 5/15/18 CNBC interview that antennas in your face is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019d say he was being coy, implying MLB, and being careful not to depict 5G accurately, since 5Gmmw must have increased FLD, while 5Gmlb, not for the most part.\\n\\nMcAdam touted 5Gmmw for smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality, all good reasons for planetary and health destruction. But remember, all the \\u201cSmart\\u201d out there now is WiFi, for which there is no 5Gmmw (although Verizon\\u2019s UWB Home Internet might qualify). \\u201cSmart\\u201d is the wireless tech word for monumentally stupid \\u2014 and for total surveillance and centralized coordination and control of daily life. See section The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026.\\n\\nNone of the above means things can\\u2019t change. It\\u2019s early. The MLB rollout could be just a prelude to an FLD/MMW invasion. If MMW gets a toe-hold and no one\\u2019s coming up provably sick, and people like it, it could weaken opposition and open floodgates.\\n\\nAnd there\\u2019s the question of how the many thousands of planned satellites (looking now like well more than 50,000) fit into the overall picture. Obviously, coverage comes immediately to mind, such as saturation in outlying areas? For IoT? One issue for satellites, though, is increased delay time (\\u201clatency\\u201d) due to distance. There could be a \\u2018division of labor\\u2019 among various services, such as ground for mobile and sats for entertainment.\\n\\nNote the promise of the nationwide sySTEMic programming to make kids into corporate plug-ins or hitech drones: \\u201cSTEM education emphasizes the value of a rigorous, interdisciplinary approach to education, allowing students to compete and succeed in a modern global marketplace.\\u201d How many dubious assumptions, claims and buzzwords in that PR flak?\\n\\nSTEM promises a wondrous, prosperous, techno-shiny future. It exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. In the developed world, the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum total of the latter. Speaking of which, once a city is immersed in \\u201csmart\\u201d tech, it\\u2019s likely to become a special target of hackers. Imagine the potential chaos.)\\n\\nThere have been various reports of adverse effects when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, almost certainly implying 5Gmmw. This would seem unlikely, virtually impossible, outside cities/populous areas.\\n\\nApparently, people see new infrastructure dense or not, or/and feel effects, and apparently assume MMW is in use, as we saw in the Bern example.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d harm stories consistently report symptoms existing before anyone even heard of 5G. Long before. All reported harms I\\u2019ve seen are classic 2G-4G symptoms, and mostly of the \\u2018Electrohypersensitivity\\u2019 type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\nRadiation/RF-level meters have been used to support claims. But RF meters don\\u2019t display frequencies, only power level within a range of frequencies. Ordinary meters, costing from around $120 to $400, top out at 8 GHz. 3G/4G mobile frequencies range from 600 megahertz to 2.5 GHz in the US, with 3.5 GHz coming. WiFi is 2.4 and 5 GHz. Recall, FCC defines 5Gmmw as 24 GHz to 90 GHz. Thus, current meters can\\u2019t read MMW.\\n\\nA true 5G phone would identify MMW (and MLB at this point). Professional (very expensive) meters cover low and high ranges into the upper GHz (I found one 10 MHz to 220 GHz), but also don\\u2019t display frequencies, so all frequencies present still couldn\\u2019t be identified.\\n\\nLong-term exposure, perhaps a cumulative effect, is playing into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Thus, if there is harm when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, what\\u2019s shown by existing meters? Not understood by victims and reporters? 4G, one way or another. Hysteria-induced confusion.\\n\\nOne hawker claims its meter can read \\u201c5G\\u201d based on the fact that two new MLB frequencies are used for 5G (mlb). Any old meter does this. This ruse brought to you by \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nMeters are interesting, but not really helpful for most people. Radiation is everywhere; no amount of exposure is safe; most bio-effects below heating are power-independent; and effects may be cumulative (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nA meter might come in handy for someone with outward symptoms and using some form of shielding, for example. It could be seen at what level symptoms abate \\u2013 which doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops. Most likely, it\\u2019s palliation, but it can still save much grief and help people function.\\n\\nWe can come to cautious conclusion about the frequency present by type of effect. Known effects of MMW (a limited volume of science, though growing) differ from MLB effects long reported in the voluminous dismissed science.\\n\\nMMW potentially threatens skin and eyes, but more effects are being reported, although sometimes \\u2018stretched.\\u2019 For example, a paper cited (in an article by a prominent scientist who must remain anonymous) to show that 5Gmmw impacts \\u201cheart rate variability\\u201d was a military directed-energy study (see Author Information) using 94 GHz at 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2). That\\u2019s essentially the \\u201cADS\\u201d system noted earlier.\\n\\nNot only is 75 mW 75 times the main FCC limit (limits vary with frequency), but 94 is a frequency higher than the upper limit of 5Gmmw defined by the FCC, and certainly wouldn\\u2019t be used in mobile applications. Making cases?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not that MMW can\\u2019t create MLB effects, but it\\u2019s a bit speculative at this point. It\\u2019s possible, however \\u201c\\u2026since nerves, blood vessels and other electrically conducting structures can carry radiation-induced currents deep into the body\\u201d (see section 5G is qualitatively and quantitatively different from 4G)\\n\\nAntenna technology called MIMO (pron. my-mo) has been around for about a decade now for MLB. The more recent development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, meaning many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming (and receiving) beams of radiation. It looks to be destined for both FR1 and FR2 (a virtual necessity for MMW). As noted, Sprint will use this at for 5G at 3.5 GHz.\\n\\nOne question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose an additional threat. It\\u2019s possible they have an effect different from traditional antennas. Also, it seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of many focused beams, although being immersed in a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\nIn any case, aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying a beam from point to point (line of sight) avoids high power output per beam, since penetration of intervening structures isn\\u2019t required.\\n\\nHysteria often warns of outrageously high power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d As noted, effects occur at all levels below heating, which is why 3G/4G need to go. And it would not behoove the industry for people to suddenly be suffering heat damage.\\n\\nDetails of several typical news reports follow. Most demonstrate the fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one shows a more general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\nThe story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from a Verizon antenna installed near the home illustrates confusion. The first video on this page shows testimony before the Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with the mayor present.\\n\\nThe type of antenna isn\\u2019t given. But it\\u2019s probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. We learned from the \\u201cgushing PR piece\\u201d cited in the 5G Rollouts section that Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strange that the testimony date precedes the stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests prior to the grand \\u201cunveiling,\\u201d so it could have been an early \\u201cHome\\u201d antenna. Or maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\nThe opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that ambiguous statement mean to the person who wrote it? To the viewer? The incident suggests harm (cold/flu symptoms) from 5Gmmw but still reinforces the importance of knowing what we mean when we say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\nThe mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although her prepared speech commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but the suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness, even though levels \\u201care still very high\\u201d will certainly be taken officially as \\u201ccorrelation,\\u201d not proof or even evidence.\\n\\nTypically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\nBottom line: Which 5G is present is academic, since the pre-\\u201c5G\\u201d endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal. Focus on \\u201c5G\\u201d is like fretting about a wildfire 10 miles away while your house is burning down.\\n\\nOne of the more outrageous opposition-induced hysterias in recent times is a story from Gateshead, a town in northern UK near the North Sea, that new LED street lights (no microwave fixtures on them, just the lights) were emitting \\u201c5G\\u201d and causing health issues. This was carelessly picked up by other outlets. No one gave a moment\\u2019s thought to the likelihood that it might be LED lights themselves.\\n\\nA news report from Cincinnati clearly demonstrates that folks are in the dark about what 5G is, thanks to hysteria. And a fairly well-known one from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, to its credit, shows a better general awareness of wireless threat. But both demonstrate questionable thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make them safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem).\\n\\nScroll down this page to see an RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story. Regardless of one\\u2019s opinion of RT, this one\\u2019s a great and accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\nThe original story from 9/20/19 (now includes an update) is a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria,\\u201d since no one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers up to this point. It involves a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that \\u201cpeople fear\\u201d will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d.\\n\\nThe 9/27/19 update shows a video interview with a concerned nurse, a conditioned \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacking understanding of the wireless threat. She\\u2019ll feel safer if that nasty tall tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\nThe tall, new-look tower with the cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video) is clearly not the massive MIMO 5Gmmw/small-cell type shown in the 5G-phone report in the 5G Rollouts section. That was Verizon\\u2019s.\\n\\nThe update also says the tower is Sprint\\u2019s. As noted, Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using massive MIMO. It being a Sprint tower, it\\u2019s not MMW. The \\u201c5G\\u201d fear was an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\nSo what\\u2019s in the cylindrical fixture? Could be 4G (LTE), 5Gmlb (\\u201c5G\\u201d), WiFi as well? WiMax? One question \\u2013 is it MIMO? Massive? Anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\nThe update notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are also popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman David Weissmann confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what? From what we\\u2019ve seen of Verizon, probably 5Gmlb, i.e., 4G LTE on FR1 steroids.\\n\\nThe San Joaquin report, from 3/12/19 also concerns a tall tower with a cylindrical fixture. But this isn\\u2019t about 5G, but about \\u201ca cell tower\\u201d being too close to an elementary school in Ripon with a \\u2018cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\n\\u201cAll in all, three teachers and four students have been battling various cancers since 2016,\\u201d as well as a 22-year-old former male student. Of course, those teachers and that young man \\u2018never\\u2019 used a wireless device, and never near that tower. Nor were they exposed to another tower or anyone else\\u2019s phone. This doesn\\u2019t seem to dawn on people.\\n\\nThe Ripon case is interesting. An independent expert was consulted, who contradicted official assurance that the tower tested within federal standards. He said he wouldn\\u2019t send his kids there, because kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed \\u2013 as if they\\u2019re not exposed 24/7 anywhere a phone/tower system is working, not only from towers, but many phones as well. And does he think that once you\\u2019re \\u201cdeveloped\\u201d it\\u2019s OK?\\n\\nSprint subsequently shut it down and agreed to relocate, guilty or not. The move was good PR, and indicates that companies and municipalities will back down \\u2013 probably to avoid litigation, since that could open floodgates.\\n\\nRipon is important for two more reasons. The first is the usually overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure (see History of Official Awareness below). It\\u2019s well known, for example, that effects from cigarette tobacco and ionizing radiation (like a hospital X-ray), are cumulative. There\\u2019s no reason wireless radiation should be any different.\\n\\nMost kids are heavily exposed in our wireless world, wherever they are \\u2013 many from conception, and even before that, especially to ovarian DNA damage. This is one egregious crime of the technology.\\n\\nThe second reason is the bogus advice that \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the false argument for slow death over quicker death, or the futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can even make things worse. The farther the source, the greater are reflection and refraction of signals, creating a far more chaotic condition for the body to handle. Any telecom/WiFi antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\nReducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usually usage tips but also lower exposure limits. Despite calls for the latter, it holds mostly for heating. For non-heating effects, lower power could even increase the threat, since there\\u2019s a good chance that the closer we get to the minute power levels used by biosystems for intercellular communication, a greater confusion sets in.\\n\\nWith regard to usage tips, \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures accumulate over time to engender serious disease \\u2013 of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem, whose damage these clever warnings for humans worsen.\\n\\nThe problem is that reliance on power level alone to determine safety is largely a convenience (there\\u2019s that fatal word again), not science. The reader doesn\\u2019t need to understand the following terms, just that there are several factors in play, including whether the signal is continuous or pulsed, the shape of the pulsations, the rise time, fall time and duration of the pulsations, the type and depth of modulation, the frequencies, and the bandwidth.\\n\\nTry to set a \\u201csafe\\u201d exposure limit based on all that. So they keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\nA corollary is that folks claiming harm seem to think it\\u2019s for the first time. This is fatal error. There are also stories wherein people or animals affected by, say, a Smart meter, regard symptom abatement when the meter is removed as complete recovery. More fatal error. People have no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway. By now, the reader should know why.\\n\\nAn Idaho organization, ehsidaho.com, collects reports on the incidence and effects of what\\u2019s being called electrohypersensitivity, or EHS. The term is misleading, because no living thing is unaffected by the radiation, whether it manifests outwardly or not. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 is suggested.\\n\\nAn estimated 35% of the population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\nClaire Edwards, a former UN staffer, top writer and wireless activist said to me in an email that an estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. The rest of society is virtually thumbing its nose at these unfortunate people. But they\\u2019ll also suffer if this red flag is ignored: As bad as this sensitivity is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad, either in incidence or severity, as things could quickly and easily get.\\n\\nIllness caused by wireless radiation is not new or unique to it, even though there are lists and categories of issues attributed to it. In medicine, a symptom can be caused by any number of influences, and a single influence can cause various symptoms.\\n\\nSo a big question is, how much of today\\u2019s ongoing ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 that is, defined and named prior to the wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to telecom/WiFi radiation (or even the whole radiation gamut to which we expose ourselves)?\\n\\nIf officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\nThus even for EMF-sick users \\u2014 who are much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors (oblivious) attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\nBut quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 is what must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\nManifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere (see The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026).\\n\\nIf we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\nOf the several historical documents acknowledging the deleterious effects of artificial electromagnetic fields denied by FCC, the definitive one for wireless tech seems to be a 1981 World Health Organization (WHO) report entitled Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973. (I\\u2019ve always thought it unfortunate and instructive that \\u201cenvironmental health\\u201d is not about techno-human torment of Earth, but concern about just payback for the tormentor).\\n\\nThe report is long, covering many aspects. It covers all telecom/WiFi frequencies, including MMW; but real-world harm for the last three decades has come, and continues from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\nAs forthright as the WHO publication purports to be, the Summary reveals a distressing ruthlessness. It\\u2019s all most people need to read to understand that \\u2018they\\u2019 knew. For reader convenience, a brief review follows.\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.3 Biological effects in experimental animals: It has been demonstrated that low-level, long-term exposure may induce effects in the nervous, haematopoietic (production of blood cells and platelets), and immuno-competent cell systems of animals. Such effects have been reported in small animals (rodents) exposed to incident power density levels as low as 0.1-1.0 mW/cm2\\u201d (\\u201cmW\\u201d = milliwatt \\u2013 one thousandth of a watt). So this is one tenth of one thousandth of a watt to one thousandth of a watt per square centimeter. FCC limit: one thousandth of a watt \\u2013 1 mW/cm2 (for frequencies 1500 MHz \\u2013 100 GHz).\\n\\n\\u201cThe reported effects on the nervous system include behavioural, bioelectrical, metabolic, and structural (at the cellular and subcellular levels) changes. Erythrocyte production and haemaglobin synthesis may be impaired and immunological reactivity changed.\\u201d OK so far (except for exploiting/hurting animals).\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.6: Health risk evaluation as a basis for exposure limits: \\u2026 A highly conservative approach would be to keep exposure limits close to natural background levels. However, this is not technically feasible [emphasis added]. A reasonable risk-benefit analysis has to be considered.\\u201d\\n\\nIs \\u201chighly conservative\\u201d a euphemism for \\u201csafe\\u201d? And what does \\u201cclose\\u201d mean? In any case, the \\u201cbackground level,\\u201c called the cosmic background is 0.0000000001 \\u2013 0.000000000000001 \\u00b5W/cm2 (\\u00b5W = microwatt \\u2013 one millionth of a watt). Thus, the higher background limit (first one) is one ten billionth of a millionth of a watt (sounds like just a few electrons to me \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nFCC limit is on the other side of the decimal point at 1000 \\u00b5W/cm2. a thousand millionths of a watt \\u2013 per square centimeter, that is. Frankly, the author\\u2019s head goes into a spin with these minuscule decimals, but it\\u2019s safe to say there\\u2019s a bit of a margin between FCC and Cosmos \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nThe FCC limit is outrageous even compared to the most conservative proposed \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit: .003 \\u2013 .006 \\u00b5W/cm2. and the BioInitiative Report authors say it might even need to be lower..\\n\\nImportantly, however, the cosmic variety is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed). That means there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limit after all: zero.\\n\\n\\u201cNot technically feasible\\u201d? Well, of course. Technology is more important than health in some minds. \\u201cReasonable risk-benefit\\u201d? The Summary doesn\\u2019t say how many sick or dead per million is reasonable. (Please see also)\\n\\nOne wonders if they were aware of earlier studies, referred to by Andrew Michrowski, PhD at the 2009 Toronto Whole Life Expo (see section, Key Testimony in Toronto in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMichrowski interprets the data for us: \\u201cAnalysis of 1950 -1974 mortality of 40,000 Korean War veterans shows that microwave exposure effect is cumulative [emphasis added] it affects all deaths \\u2026 doubling to tripling cancers of eye, brain and central nervous system, lymphatic and hematopoietic [blood-cell/platelet-forming] and digestive systems. This means that even \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures from wireless systems accumulate over the years and decades to engender serious diseases\\u201d (can\\u2019t be said too often).\\n\\nNor do we know if the Warsaw International Symposium or its WHO reviewers were aware that the US military and others conducted microwave stealth-weapon research in the 1950s. This technology became 2G. See Sections Assault: From Weapon to Telecom and Ultimate Atrocity in the Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nOpposition warnings frequently emphasize \\u2018protecting you and your family.\\u2019 The point having been made several times is worth repeating: The most dire threat is to the ecosystem, not humans. No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\nEnvironment usually suffers in the background of hysteria. One will see lists something like this: \\u201chealth, privacy, security, and the environment.\\u201d\\n\\nThose who offer exposure \\u201csolutions\\u201d or \\u201ctips\\u201d seem to forget that no form or amount of human protection does so for Nature. A false sense of security in being \\u201csafer\\u201d leads to continued use and support of the overall system, immeasurably intensifying that threat.\\n\\nInsects, for example, are highly susceptible to telecom/WiFi microwave, especially to MMW, which we haven\\u2019t even had yet. In the last quarter century or so, coinciding closely with the introduction of 2G, 75% of the biomass of insects has disappeared in otherwise protected areas in Germany. Meaning it\\u2019s probably worse where other threats co-exist.\\n\\nEmphatically: The wireless threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. We need to look at the context of wireless, which is technology, per se. And one thing is certain about most of that, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\nIn almost all cases, somewhere along the line from resource acquisition (especially mining) to manufacture, use, and disposal, advanced technology is chemically/energetically toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless encompasses the entire line of a process of Earth liquidation/sacrifice for human \\u201cneeds\\u201d \\u2013 money, convenience, and entertainment (see section The Price of Techno-Civilization in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMoving to \\u201cwired\\u201d telecom/WiFi will not stop this assault. Countries are under siege for resources. Nor will the Elite psyops \\u201cSustainable Development\\u201d and \\u201cClean Renewable Energy\\u201d stop it. But that\\u2019s another article.\\n\\nThe attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed. I ask that anyone who can name a major environmental or health crisis in which technology isn\\u2019t the cause or doesn\\u2019t play a major role, comment about it.\\n\\nLooking at the overall output of \\u201cconcerned\\u201d EMF scientists and activists, however, if one isn\\u2019t careful, one could conclude it\\u2019s thought that humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\nAnother major concern is disproportionate attention on local antennas, while a massive satellite program proceeds. At one point, up to 20,000 satellites were planned to blanket the globe. But the number keeps growing.\\n\\nMadman Elon Musk\\u2019s SpaceX had dibs on 12,000 for 5Gmmw. Here is news that Madman is applying for 30,000 more. Just 42,000 satellites will be about 5 times the total spacecraft launched since 1957 (8,500).\\n\\nSeveral other companies, including Boeing, OneWeb, Amazon, Facebook, not to mention Russia and China, mean many thousands more. Total madness could bring it to somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000. This considered sane. Why? Because insanity unrecognized as such has become the norm in the culture of toxic-technomasturbation.\\n\\nPollution. Some 150 tons of refined kerosene and 340 tons of liquid oxygen per Musk 5G launch (60 satellites, 400 kg each). Do the math, even for 12,000. There seems to be no concern for consequences, such as potential damage to the ozone layer, major interference with earth\\u2019s energy field, or even increased atmospheric CO2 (for the faithful). Not to mention, decline of breathable free oxygen (very cool dynamic graph).\\n\\nMuch seems to be up in the air on the satellite program. Since launches proceed in haste, the plan seems to be shoot them up first, answer proprietary questions later, dismissing anyone else\\u2019s. In Europe, there are currently calls for papers on satellite integration with 5G, with submissions deadline being the Ides of March 2020.\\n\\nNASA, NOAA, meteorologists, (and radio astronomers) have issued valid concerns about MMW. FCC has dismissed them, too. Yet, NASA intends to participate in this bit of insanity.\\n\\nMight such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates? Insane is a good word for it, but psychopathic puts a more specific tag on it. See subsections Same Old Story\\u2026 and \\u2026with a Twist in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nThe best way to beat 5G, on the ground at least, is to quit wireless tech flat. Little demand \\u2018down here\\u2019 could greatly reduce incentive to invest \\u2018up there\\u2019. If there is a total-surveillance and human-control system gestating in the technosphere, how much of a role could satellites play?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strongly suggested that an outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the one on earthbound antennas.\\n\\nTaking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\nAgain, a race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse. Allowing classic 4G (or even just 5G FR1) to continue potentiates imminent disaster. Both scenarios are in progress, but at the \\u2018deniable\\u2019 stage. When \\u2018undeniable\\u2019 sets in, the slope will almost certainly have become too steep and slippery.\\n\\nExperience shows that science-based appeals, to governments at all levels; to national and international regulatory bodies, and so on is an exercise in futility due to multiple factors, including corruption, disbelief, and intimidation. Old and chronic conditions.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s in the People\\u2019s hands now, at the commercial level. Either common sense prevails over addiction and selfishness, or we wait for the race to end and hope it\\u2019s not too late.\\n\\nGive up wireless per se or give up the future \\u2013 liberty first, then life. If not, then welcome all 5G, especially the satellites. Surrender to it will mercifully shorten the coming agony.\\n\\nPeter Tocci is a retired massage therapist and wellness consultant with an abiding interest in exploring \\u2018managed\\u2019 history, nefarious covert agendas, and mainstream/mainstream-alternative news-media dereliction, distortion and suppression.

A small number of revisions might not appear in the Summaries.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation.

The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\nWithout any help from \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers, the \\u201cnext generation\\u201d wireless is very dangerous \\u2014 all by itself \\u2014 as is each previous G by itself.

And that doesn\\u2019t cover all critical aspects.\\n\\nConfusion begins right off the bat with the term \\u201c5G.\\u201d It\\u2019s being flung carelessly about, in articles, protests, news reports, corporate bulletins, by politicians \\u2013 even by scientists, and in submissions and comments to official bodies.\\n\\nAlmost always implied when \\u201c5G\\u201d is uttered \\u2013 especially, \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d or \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d \\u2013 is use of the \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This causes misunderstanding and potential danger.\\n\\nOverall, EHF is specified as 30 GHz to 300 GHz, and wavelength 10 millimeters to 1mm respectively. Only a small portion of that range is used in high-frequency 5G operation, and is defined in the US by the FCC as 24 GHz to 90 GHz.\\n\\nAs explained below in 5G Rollouts, for accuracy one must at least distinguish between 1) \\u2018small-cell\\u2019 infrastructure and 5G/small cells per se; 2) between 5G infrastructure and 5G high-frequency radiation; 3) between antennas and their enclosures, and **4) between high frequency 5G and mid-/low-band 5G, the signaling long used for 2G-4G iterations.\\n\\nNew terms are offered here for consistency and for clarifying hysteria-induced misunderstanding and confusion: \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d is a housing for antennas (sending/receiving elements). A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\nOne might see warnings such as: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSmall cell\\u201d is regularly misused, even by the Industry. Accurately speaking, a cell is not an antenna, but the effective area/range of an antenna\\u2019s radiation. 5Gmmw has a short range, which decreases with higher frequency. Thus, its cell is comparatively small.\\n\\nAlso, MMW can easily be blocked, even by even leaves and heavy rain, which deficiency increases with increasing frequency. Both drawbacks can be improved with a substantial power boost, but this also becomes a problem with energy cost and exposure levels, and so is not under consideration. Energy consumption is a major concern for the industry, which is feverishly at work to solve it.\\n\\nShort range and easy \\u2018blockability\\u2019 require more fixture locations, which hysteria frets about, rarely noting the distinction that 5Gmlb makes a large cell and is not blocked. Call it nitpicking if you will, but why not be accurate instead of creating misconception or \\u2018making cases\\u2019?\\n\\n\\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density, and common hysteria about how it will be implemented are in serious question (more later).\\n\\nOne interesting discovery came up while working on this article: Small cells are small but not new, and were not developed for 5G. Small cells have long been deployed in 3G and 4G networks and have become an industry choice to deliver MMW and enable better MLB performance if needed.\\n\\nTraditionally, there have been three types of small cells (more now), identified as they should be by antenna range. Some early deployments were in the US in 2007 and in the UK and Europe in 2009. \\u201cAccording to Small Cell Forum (who would have thought?), 18 million small cells had been deployed globally for various applications by the end of 2016.\\u201d\\n\\nBut haven\\u2019t we been led in a virtually deliberate way from the outset, and even continue to be, to think that 5G is small cells/MMW? Saying \\u201c5G\\u201d to indicate only these two things, or not specifying what you mean, is irresponsible, inaccurate, and misleading, as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nA 10/8/19 bulletin from Project Censored was forwarded to me via an email group that received it from Joel M. Moskowitz, PhD, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at UC Berkeley. A typically careless statement consisting of an error and a question mark says, \\u201cThe telecom industry is promoting the replacement of the current cellular network, known as 4G, with a new generation of higher frequency 5G wavelengths to power the \\u201cInternet of Things\\u2026\\u201d As a generalization, this is either shameful unawareness of the current scenario or untruth/propaganda, as we\\u2019ll also see.\\n\\n5G opposition also asserts that the skin\\u2019s (spiral) sweat ducts act as \\u201creceiving antennas.\\u201d This refers to an Israeli study, \\u201cThe human skin as a sub-THz receiver \\u2013 Does 5G pose a danger to it or not?\\u201d\\n\\nFrequency ranges don\\u2019t transition abruptly, but sub-THz usually means a range of 300 GHz down to 90, which is the upper end of FCC 5Gmmw.\\n\\nThe study Abstract uses two unquantified terms, \\u201csub-terahertz band\\u201d and \\u201csub-THz region.\\u201d I think \\u201cregion\\u201d is more accurate, meaning the range, or \\u201cspectrum\\u201d as understood in tech circles. \\u201cBand\\u201d is used to designate a single frequency, but also is an interval between a lower and upper frequency. For instance, a transmission between 40 and 50 MHz is a 10 MHz band (width).\\n\\nStudy frequencies were 75 GHz to 110 GHz. No wireless provider I\\u2019m aware of (in the US) has announced a mobile 5Gmmw service anywhere near 75 GHz. There was no explanation in the Abstract why announced commercial frequencies were not used.\\n\\nPower-level exposure limits at the user end are expressed in watts per area, usually square meter or square centimeter. No such levels are provided for the targets used, but maybe that\\u2019s not relevant in this case.\\n\\nThe highest commercial frequency I could find being tested is in the UK (though also approved for US), is 60 GHz. At least one rural test area is reportedly using a 60 GHz \\u201cwireless mesh\\u201d (interior network of interacting antennas) for \\u2018super WiFi.\\u2019 Not for mobile and still not up to 75 GHz.\\n\\nInteresting is that other UK rural testbeds are running unused TV bands called \\u201cTV white space\\u201d \\u2014 the old VHF to UHF frequencies, mostly MHz bands. This is 5G, mind you.\\n\\nHowever, bandwidths 71 to 76 GHz, 81 to 86 GHz and 92 to 95 GHz are available in the US for \\u201chigh-density\\u201d (high power) \\u201cfixed wireless access\\u201d services: \\u201c\\u2026the operation of wireless communication devices or systems used to connect two fixed locations (e.g., building to building or tower to building) with a radio or other wireless link\\u2026\\u201d, which would have to be line-of-sight and are not for mobile.\\n\\nAs noted, the higher the frequency, the greater are transmission challenges, so high-density bands would be very tight beams, with minimal to no obstacles and no human exposure (watch out, pigeons). Due to excess electricity consumption, MMW signals probably won\\u2019t be power boosted sufficiently to penetrate buildings, but be brought in via cable from an external receiver, then be distributed via a wireless network.\\n\\nStudy conclusion: \\u201cWe are raising a warning flag against the unrestricted use of sub-THz technologies for communication, before the possible consequences for public health are explored.\\u201d This seems sane enough \\u2013 within the insane context called wireless telecom/WiFi. See Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (needs updating).\\n\\nBut \\u201cunrestricted\\u201d at least suggests the impossible, that restrictions could prevent all trouble. Note also \\u201cpossible consequences.\\u201d This can\\u2019t be valid for harm in general, which is a fact long understood \\u2013 almost three decades before 2G came out (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\nWhen this warning is given, we don\\u2019t hear that the \\u201cwarning flag\\u201d would apply conceptually to all G\\u2019s; presumes there is a safe dose of MLB somewhere; and, as usual, neglects the ecosystem. But \\u2014 enough for protesters to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas? Making cases? I confess I fell for this one in my early research on wireless. A more likely, but still speculative, concern is discussed in Reports of \\u201c5G\\u201d Harm.\\n\\nAnother common warning, \\u201c5G is a weapon,\\u201d usually refers to the military\\u2019s Active Denial System, a \\u201cnon-lethal\\u201d microwave device for dispersing crowds by heating the skin. It\\u2019s a high density (power) millimeter wave at 95 GHz \\u2013 hardly commercial 5Gmmw.\\n\\nMMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G. Wireless telecom, beginning with 2G, is adapted stealth-weapon technology which uses very low power. The entire wireless system, not just \\u201c5G\\u201d, is a potential weapon on various levels (more below).\\n\\nAlso, high-enough density microwave \\u2014 at a \\u2018lowly\\u2019 2.5 GHz, for example \\u2014 will cook you like a microwave oven (2.45 GHz). That is, through and through, unlike ADS. At commercial power levels, 5Gmmw will not.\\n\\nA powerful Air Force radar system called Pave Paws at three US locations will cook you in a nanosecond at 420 to 450 MHz. Installations have two large circular arrays of antenna elements, each array radiating 580 kilowatts (!) It can detect a basketball at 12 miles, and small planes caught in the beam have blown up. So don\\u2019t swallow the rhetoric about telecom MMW weaponry.\\n\\nI was unable to find a range of ADS power output, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study calling out 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2) at 94 GHz (see Reports of Harm). ADS power is adjustable, however, enough to be used as a lethal weapon. But \\u2013 \\u2018making cases\\u2019 again?\\n\\nMicrowave ovens operate from 600 to 1200 watts. By comparison, maximum output of traditional cell towers is 10 watts \\u2013 phones, 2 watts. The higher frequency/shorter wavelength was chosen for ADS to limit penetration depth. Not saying that\\u2019s a good thing, not to mention it\\u2019s misleading (see Reports of Harm).\\n\\nFinding a wattage output figure for new, 5G MLB or MMW antennas proved fruitlessly time consuming (anyone?), but I did find a study establishing a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for a particular 5Gmmw antenna design for 28 and 38 GHz.\\n\\nSAR is an expression of how much radiation from a phone is absorbed over time by the body. It\\u2019s expressed in watts per kilogram (W/kg). Values were \\u201c\\u20260.37 and 1.34 W/kg [up to] 2 W/kg. Current FCC SAR standard is 1.6W/kg. This is given just for a sense of comparison, because SAR is useless for determining the amount of radiofrequency (RF) absorption in biosystems during typical conditions of use. See Safety Testing below.\\n\\nMany opposers suggest that 3G/4G/WiFi can be made reasonably safe. Others understand that impossibility, but seem too habituated and addicted to do the right thing. As noted in the Introduction, techno-humans are adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\n\\u201cNo \\u20185G\\u2019 safety studies have been conducted or funded by the Federal Communications Commission or the telecom industry, and none is planned.\\u201d Or simply, \\u201c5G has not been tested for safety\\u201d. Or the like. No such claims provide the facts.\\n\\nThat the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d terror, whereas, the real terror is wireless tech per se. Inherent in this ploy is the erroneous implication that 2G-4G were tested (a yes and no proposition).\\n\\nIn 1996, FCC adopted the standard identified as ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992. There were \\u2018window dressings\\u2019 in 2004, 2005, and 2010, and, like the original, covered frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019. (Overall \\u2018microwave\\u2019 is considered to be 300 MHz (.3 GHz) to 300 GHz.\\n\\nThe Commission\\u2019s assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is based on the fraudulent IEEE \\u2018testing\\u2019 it adopted in 1996 to run interference for 3G. That is, if the radiation doesn\\u2019t heat you, it can\\u2019t harm you.\\n\\nThis author warned of this response by FCC in February 2019 as \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria was powering up: Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised? Exposure limits worldwide are based on the ANSI/IEEE C95.1 fraud.\\n\\nPeer reviewed independent science, as early as the 1950s and still going, demonstrating myriad effects at non-heating levels, brings the integrity of C95.1-1992 through 2019 into question. Was *proper* testing ever done? Instead of clarifying this, hysteria makes the blanket claim. Making cases.\\n\\nThe FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science and such questions: \\u2018No convincing evidence exists, but we\\u2019re keeping an eye on it.\\u2019 The blatant criminality of the FCC with respect to wireless/EMF is clearly demonstrated by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nHysteria often resorts to another \\u2018ploy on words\\u2019 pertaining to 2G-4G, and used even by scientists, as seen near the end of this report: \\u201cThe current FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d The word implies that standards were at one time valid or sufficient, when they were never any such thing, for any living thing.\\n\\n\\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing has been demonstrated or can exist. Despite this, new limits are proposed and stubbornly called for \\u2014 in spite of the consensus that no safe level has even been published for fetuses.\\n\\nApparently, that\\u2019s not of sufficient concern to call for \\u201cStop Wireless Technology!\\u201d instead of \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d We\\u2019ll figure that fetus part out later.\\n\\nFor details on the original \\u2018safety\\u2019 testing \\u2013 scientific fraud, that is, on which power-level exposure limits worldwide are based \\u2013 see Sections Cell Phone Output and Exposure Limits for Users in the article Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\nMajor emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA,\\u2019 due to the short range and easy block-ability of MMW. But things seem to be developing differently for now, as we\\u2019ll see. As noted, even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\nThe following synthesis is the result of wading through too many articles to give credit to any one. Some sources tell varying stories about the same thing, and even disagree with each other considerably.\\n\\nSo here goes: A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard has been issued, specifying two frequency ranges: 5G NR bands FR1 & 5G NR bands FR2. Number one is for current bands below 6 GHz (5Gmlb), such as 600MHz, 1900MHz, and 2.5GHz; two is for MMW \\u2014 mostly 24 to 40 GHz for mobile, and higher for special applications (not mobile). In the near term, public WiFi will remain separate at MLB, 2.45 GHz and 5 GHz, but Verizon, for example, is offering 5Gmmw home internet/WiFi (not mobile) in limited areas of four cities.\\n\\n5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention at this point, including especially \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and \\u2018beamforming\\u2019 (more later).\\n\\nHowever, 5G NR FR1 can use the same towers as 4G, but will need new antennas. It has the same reach and penetration, but with shorter delay, while providing up to 35 percent more speed. The wireless addict\\u2019s dream. When you think about it, FR1 should really be 5G, and 5Gmmw, 6G.\\n\\nPlans are also in place for deployments using the unlicensed, Citizens Broadband Radio Service 3.5 GHz band, and all key players really want in. This is MLB called 5G, mind you.\\n\\nThings get a bit stickier when it comes to needing a new phone or not. Many current phones should be able to get updates to process FR1, but a new phone is needed for FR2. Generally, the \\u201ctech\\u201d advice is not to move yet, and here\\u2019s an example with Samsung\\u2019s $1300 5G Galaxy S10 being tested in Chicago (good shot of a 5Gmmw \\u201cnode\\u201d here).\\n\\nThe \\u201chold off\\u201d sentiment is conveyed also in this article. What it amounts to at this writing is that 5Gmmw is virtually at a \\u201cdemo\\u201d stage, not full coverage and service, even in town.\\n\\nMany \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers continue to use traditional 3G/4G/WiFi wireless, either knowing the danger or believing it\\u2019s safe, or will be, because they just want it. A possible motive driving hysteria?\\n\\nAnother possible motive for \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, or maybe just the effect it\\u2019s having, is to create a threat on the ground to draw resistance and to distract attention from the satellite program, a much more sinister development (see Examining Priorities below).\\n\\nThe disconnect about dangers brings up a story that drew wide attention at the time, especially in the UK, and one that seems to present a puzzle. It\\u2019s about the 6/26 2019 Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, Somerset County, England. It\\u2019s not strictly a \\u201crollout\\u201d story, more a system demo/test, but a decision was announced about installing \\u201c5G\\u201d network towers on festival grounds,\\n\\nDespite the fact that \\u201cGlastonbury officials [said] that move will allow festival attendees to access the Internet on their smartphones at faster speeds,\\u201d the announcement created a huge protest. In this story, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G are mentioned, but \\u201c5G\\u201d is not specified as MLB or MMW \\u2014 as anything, in other words. Is this hysteria-induced negligence?\\n\\nThe protest article is laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated one that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d. Even some much-admired professional associates/contacts promote this irresponsible notion. I must respectfully, but strongly, disagree, because the erroneous implication is that 2G-4G were/are not an experiment. Paradoxically, they were/are and were/are not experiments. Distinctions must be made (more below).\\n\\nConfusion again: \\u201cWhile obviously not many festival-goers are likely to have a \\u20185G\\u2019 phone by June, EE will be showing off what the network can do at its stand.\\u201d Once again, unspecified 5G. So, was the Glastonbury demo about 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb? Whatever, tickets sold out in less than 45 minutes.\\n\\nThe grand protest by potential attendees was both tragic and macabrely amusing: They were prepared to irradiate themselves constantly in huge numbers (up to 200,000 fans in attendance potentially using phones/smartphones), but fretted over \\u201c5G\\u201d, not even knowing it could have been their beloved 4G poison\\u2026reborn. Phone radiation is often overlooked.\\n\\nSimilarly, reports on the 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland clearly reflect the confusion and negligent use of \\u201c5G.\\u201d This Agence France-Presse story says, \\u201cBy early July, 334 antennae (sic) stations for 5G were operational across the country, authorities have told AFP.\\u201d Boy, watch out for authorities.\\n\\nAntenna location and density info aren\\u2019t revealed, but it could be urban or \\u2018near-urban.\\u2019 The number doesn\\u2019t seem to correspond to FLD in neighborhoods, but who knows, thanks to incomplete reporting (and perhaps misled authorities). The news reader is therefore in the dark about exactly what\\u2019s going on, but probably assumes it\\u2019s MMW. Due to\\u2026 \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s (but beginning much earlier). What was known then was later hushed in the runup to digital mobile telecom in 1991-2.\\n\\nThe decision was callously made long ago to put life/people at risk to have the technology (see History of Official Awareness below). Thus, the yes/no \\u201cexperiment\\u201d is not whether there will be harm from telecom/WiFi microwave, but the time window in which ongoing exposure damage \\u2014 across all frequencies and regardless of power level \\u2014 will manifest in a cascade of widespread intractable illness.\\n\\nNot to worry, though, that fate might be avoided: Ecosystem collapse could bring the house down beforehand. You might hear/see, \\u201cThe 5G race is on,\\u201d meaning market competition. The race of note, though, is between ecosystem collapse and human-health collapse.\\n\\nIn any case, here\\u2019s some of what\\u2019s happening in \\u2018real\\u2019 life. The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon. Carriers are choosing service areas for FR1, FR2 very carefully.\\n\\nT-Mobile has announced a nationwide 5Gmlb rollout at 600 MHz and an undisclosed application of \\u201c28 and 39\\u201d (see video), which means some 5Gmmw, almost certainly in cities.\\n\\nSprint\\u2019s plans are to run \\u201cLTE and 5G\\u201d simultaneously in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\nMentioned earlier, Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d (allegedly MMW \\u2013 5Gmmw) is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range to cover wide area\\u201d (5Gmlb), doesn\\u2019t say where.\\n\\nSacramento seems to be the most enthusiastic victim host for wireless. Here\\u2019s a gushing PR piece about a Verizon UWB installation at one Sacramento citizen\\u2019s home, with City officials attending. It features an external receiver. Sacramento also prides itself on opening the floodgates for \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more later).\\n\\nVerizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas, which could be its final destination. Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason. Ecocidal, terminally pathological 3G/4G still rages, again reflecting the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nThe forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. As noted earlier, drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for \\u201c18 million new\\u201d closely spaced fixtures nationwide. Given the above information on FR1 rollouts, there seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\nA report on new Qualcomm smartphone antennas supports the foregoing. It covers four bands between 26.5GHz and 40 GHz, but also antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 The QPM56xx RF module family works with the Snapdragon X50 modem to work in the sub-6GHz bands\\u2026\\u201d (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\nOne puzzle: It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) as specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs seem to disagree, saying 4G can handle IoT. Propaganda? Careless chatter? Who knows. It\\u2019s safe to assume, however, they refer to the new 4G/5Gmlb.\\n\\nSome opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. And the attempted widespread deployment of smart utility meters on 4G WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say. 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, because if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\nI didn\\u2019t bother spending the rest of my life trying to find if/where FLD installations are occurring. Anyone who\\u2019s seen close installations in any area, please share details in Comments.\\n\\nNow, if FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose. One, possibility of course, is optimized 5Gmlb performance, as in the past, although this shouldn\\u2019t often be necessary, due to the large cell and penetration of MLB.\\n\\nIn the entrained, FLD frame of mind, I was suspicious in Wireless Technology: \\u2026 (The 5G Locomotive section) of Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams\\u2019 statement in a 5/15/18 CNBC interview that antennas in your face is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019d say he was being coy, implying MLB, and being careful not to depict 5G accurately, since 5Gmmw must have increased FLD, while 5Gmlb, not for the most part.\\n\\nMcAdam touted 5Gmmw for smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality, all good reasons for planetary and health destruction. But remember, all the \\u201cSmart\\u201d out there now is WiFi, for which there is no 5Gmmw (although Verizon\\u2019s UWB Home Internet might qualify). \\u201cSmart\\u201d is the wireless tech word for monumentally stupid \\u2014 and for total surveillance and centralized coordination and control of daily life. See section The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026.\\n\\nNone of the above means things can\\u2019t change. It\\u2019s early. The MLB rollout could be just a prelude to an FLD/MMW invasion. If MMW gets a toe-hold and no one\\u2019s coming up provably sick, and people like it, it could weaken opposition and open floodgates.\\n\\nAnd there\\u2019s the question of how the many thousands of planned satellites (looking now like well more than 50,000) fit into the overall picture. Obviously, coverage comes immediately to mind, such as saturation in outlying areas? For IoT? One issue for satellites, though, is increased delay time (\\u201clatency\\u201d) due to distance. There could be a \\u2018division of labor\\u2019 among various services, such as ground for mobile and sats for entertainment.\\n\\nNote the promise of the nationwide sySTEMic programming to make kids into corporate plug-ins or hitech drones: \\u201cSTEM education emphasizes the value of a rigorous, interdisciplinary approach to education, allowing students to compete and succeed in a modern global marketplace.\\u201d How many dubious assumptions, claims and buzzwords in that PR flak?\\n\\nSTEM promises a wondrous, prosperous, techno-shiny future. It exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. In the developed world, the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum total of the latter. Speaking of which, once a city is immersed in \\u201csmart\\u201d tech, it\\u2019s likely to become a special target of hackers. Imagine the potential chaos.)\\n\\nThere have been various reports of adverse effects when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, almost certainly implying 5Gmmw. This would seem unlikely, virtually impossible, outside cities/populous areas.\\n\\nApparently, people see new infrastructure dense or not, or/and feel effects, and apparently assume MMW is in use, as we saw in the Bern example.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d harm stories consistently report symptoms existing before anyone even heard of 5G. Long before. All reported harms I\\u2019ve seen are classic 2G-4G symptoms, and mostly of the \\u2018Electrohypersensitivity\\u2019 type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\nRadiation/RF-level meters have been used to support claims. But RF meters don\\u2019t display frequencies, only power level within a range of frequencies. Ordinary meters, costing from around $120 to $400, top out at 8 GHz. 3G/4G mobile frequencies range from 600 megahertz to 2.5 GHz in the US, with 3.5 GHz coming. WiFi is 2.4 and 5 GHz. Recall, FCC defines 5Gmmw as 24 GHz to 90 GHz. Thus, current meters can\\u2019t read MMW.\\n\\nA true 5G phone would identify MMW (and MLB at this point). Professional (very expensive) meters cover low and high ranges into the upper GHz (I found one 10 MHz to 220 GHz), but also don\\u2019t display frequencies, so all frequencies present still couldn\\u2019t be identified.\\n\\nLong-term exposure, perhaps a cumulative effect, is playing into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Thus, if there is harm when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, what\\u2019s shown by existing meters? Not understood by victims and reporters? 4G, one way or another. Hysteria-induced confusion.\\n\\nOne hawker claims its meter can read \\u201c5G\\u201d based on the fact that two new MLB frequencies are used for 5G (mlb). Any old meter does this. This ruse brought to you by \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nMeters are interesting, but not really helpful for most people. Radiation is everywhere; no amount of exposure is safe; most bio-effects below heating are power-independent; and effects may be cumulative (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nA meter might come in handy for someone with outward symptoms and using some form of shielding, for example. It could be seen at what level symptoms abate \\u2013 which doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops. Most likely, it\\u2019s palliation, but it can still save much grief and help people function.\\n\\nWe can come to cautious conclusion about the frequency present by type of effect. Known effects of MMW (a limited volume of science, though growing) differ from MLB effects long reported in the voluminous dismissed science.\\n\\nMMW potentially threatens skin and eyes, but more effects are being reported, although sometimes \\u2018stretched.\\u2019 For example, a paper cited (in an article by a prominent scientist who must remain anonymous) to show that 5Gmmw impacts \\u201cheart rate variability\\u201d was a military directed-energy study (see Author Information) using 94 GHz at 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2). That\\u2019s essentially the \\u201cADS\\u201d system noted earlier.\\n\\nNot only is 75 mW 75 times the main FCC limit (limits vary with frequency), but 94 is a frequency higher than the upper limit of 5Gmmw defined by the FCC, and certainly wouldn\\u2019t be used in mobile applications. Making cases?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not that MMW can\\u2019t create MLB effects, but it\\u2019s a bit speculative at this point. It\\u2019s possible, however \\u201c\\u2026since nerves, blood vessels and other electrically conducting structures can carry radiation-induced currents deep into the body\\u201d (see section 5G is qualitatively and quantitatively different from 4G)\\n\\nAntenna technology called MIMO (pron. my-mo) has been around for about a decade now for MLB. The more recent development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, meaning many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming (and receiving) beams of radiation. It looks to be destined for both FR1 and FR2 (a virtual necessity for MMW). As noted, Sprint will use this at for 5G at 3.5 GHz.\\n\\nOne question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose an additional threat. It\\u2019s possible they have an effect different from traditional antennas. Also, it seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of many focused beams, although being immersed in a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\nIn any case, aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying a beam from point to point (line of sight) avoids high power output per beam, since penetration of intervening structures isn\\u2019t required.\\n\\nHysteria often warns of outrageously high power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d As noted, effects occur at all levels below heating, which is why 3G/4G need to go. And it would not behoove the industry for people to suddenly be suffering heat damage.\\n\\nDetails of several typical news reports follow. Most demonstrate the fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one shows a more general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\nThe story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from a Verizon antenna installed near the home illustrates confusion. The first video on this page shows testimony before the Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with the mayor present.\\n\\nThe type of antenna isn\\u2019t given. But it\\u2019s probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. We learned from the \\u201cgushing PR piece\\u201d cited in the 5G Rollouts section that Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strange that the testimony date precedes the stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests prior to the grand \\u201cunveiling,\\u201d so it could have been an early \\u201cHome\\u201d antenna. Or maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\nThe opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that ambiguous statement mean to the person who wrote it? To the viewer? The incident suggests harm (cold/flu symptoms) from 5Gmmw but still reinforces the importance of knowing what we mean when we say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\nThe mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although her prepared speech commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but the suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness, even though levels \\u201care still very high\\u201d will certainly be taken officially as \\u201ccorrelation,\\u201d not proof or even evidence.\\n\\nTypically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\nBottom line: Which 5G is present is academic, since the pre-\\u201c5G\\u201d endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal. Focus on \\u201c5G\\u201d is like fretting about a wildfire 10 miles away while your house is burning down.\\n\\nOne of the more outrageous opposition-induced hysterias in recent times is a story from Gateshead, a town in northern UK near the North Sea, that new LED street lights (no microwave fixtures on them, just the lights) were emitting \\u201c5G\\u201d and causing health issues. This was carelessly picked up by other outlets. No one gave a moment\\u2019s thought to the likelihood that it might be LED lights themselves.\\n\\nA news report from Cincinnati clearly demonstrates that folks are in the dark about what 5G is, thanks to hysteria. And a fairly well-known one from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, to its credit, shows a better general awareness of wireless threat. But both demonstrate questionable thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make them safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem).\\n\\nScroll down this page to see an RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story. Regardless of one\\u2019s opinion of RT, this one\\u2019s a great and accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\nThe original story from 9/20/19 (now includes an update) is a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria,\\u201d since no one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers up to this point. It involves a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that \\u201cpeople fear\\u201d will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d.\\n\\nThe 9/27/19 update shows a video interview with a concerned nurse, a conditioned \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacking understanding of the wireless threat. She\\u2019ll feel safer if that nasty tall tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\nThe tall, new-look tower with the cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video) is clearly not the massive MIMO 5Gmmw/small-cell type shown in the 5G-phone report in the 5G Rollouts section. That was Verizon\\u2019s.\\n\\nThe update also says the tower is Sprint\\u2019s. As noted, Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using massive MIMO. It being a Sprint tower, it\\u2019s not MMW. The \\u201c5G\\u201d fear was an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\nSo what\\u2019s in the cylindrical fixture? Could be 4G (LTE), 5Gmlb (\\u201c5G\\u201d), WiFi as well? WiMax? One question \\u2013 is it MIMO? Massive? Anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\nThe update notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are also popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman David Weissmann confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what? From what we\\u2019ve seen of Verizon, probably 5Gmlb, i.e., 4G LTE on FR1 steroids.\\n\\nThe San Joaquin report, from 3/12/19 also concerns a tall tower with a cylindrical fixture. But this isn\\u2019t about 5G, but about \\u201ca cell tower\\u201d being too close to an elementary school in Ripon with a \\u2018cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\n\\u201cAll in all, three teachers and four students have been battling various cancers since 2016,\\u201d as well as a 22-year-old former male student. Of course, those teachers and that young man \\u2018never\\u2019 used a wireless device, and never near that tower. Nor were they exposed to another tower or anyone else\\u2019s phone. This doesn\\u2019t seem to dawn on people.\\n\\nThe Ripon case is interesting. An independent expert was consulted, who contradicted official assurance that the tower tested within federal standards. He said he wouldn\\u2019t send his kids there, because kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed \\u2013 as if they\\u2019re not exposed 24/7 anywhere a phone/tower system is working, not only from towers, but many phones as well. And does he think that once you\\u2019re \\u201cdeveloped\\u201d it\\u2019s OK?\\n\\nSprint subsequently shut it down and agreed to relocate, guilty or not. The move was good PR, and indicates that companies and municipalities will back down \\u2013 probably to avoid litigation, since that could open floodgates.\\n\\nRipon is important for two more reasons. The first is the usually overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure (see History of Official Awareness below). It\\u2019s well known, for example, that effects from cigarette tobacco and ionizing radiation (like a hospital X-ray), are cumulative. There\\u2019s no reason wireless radiation should be any different.\\n\\nMost kids are heavily exposed in our wireless world, wherever they are \\u2013 many from conception, and even before that, especially to ovarian DNA damage. This is one egregious crime of the technology.\\n\\nThe second reason is the bogus advice that \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the false argument for slow death over quicker death, or the futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can even make things worse. The farther the source, the greater are reflection and refraction of signals, creating a far more chaotic condition for the body to handle. Any telecom/WiFi antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\nReducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usually usage tips but also lower exposure limits. Despite calls for the latter, it holds mostly for heating. For non-heating effects, lower power could even increase the threat, since there\\u2019s a good chance that the closer we get to the minute power levels used by biosystems for intercellular communication, a greater confusion sets in.\\n\\nWith regard to usage tips, \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures accumulate over time to engender serious disease \\u2013 of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem, whose damage these clever warnings for humans worsen.\\n\\nThe problem is that reliance on power level alone to determine safety is largely a convenience (there\\u2019s that fatal word again), not science. The reader doesn\\u2019t need to understand the following terms, just that there are several factors in play, including whether the signal is continuous or pulsed, the shape of the pulsations, the rise time, fall time and duration of the pulsations, the type and depth of modulation, the frequencies, and the bandwidth.\\n\\nTry to set a \\u201csafe\\u201d exposure limit based on all that. So they keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\nA corollary is that folks claiming harm seem to think it\\u2019s for the first time. This is fatal error. There are also stories wherein people or animals affected by, say, a Smart meter, regard symptom abatement when the meter is removed as complete recovery. More fatal error. People have no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway. By now, the reader should know why.\\n\\nAn Idaho organization, ehsidaho.com, collects reports on the incidence and effects of what\\u2019s being called electrohypersensitivity, or EHS. The term is misleading, because no living thing is unaffected by the radiation, whether it manifests outwardly or not. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 is suggested.\\n\\nAn estimated 35% of the population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\nClaire Edwards, a former UN staffer, top writer and wireless activist said to me in an email that an estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. The rest of society is virtually thumbing its nose at these unfortunate people. But they\\u2019ll also suffer if this red flag is ignored: As bad as this sensitivity is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad, either in incidence or severity, as things could quickly and easily get.\\n\\nIllness caused by wireless radiation is not new or unique to it, even though there are lists and categories of issues attributed to it. In medicine, a symptom can be caused by any number of influences, and a single influence can cause various symptoms.\\n\\nSo a big question is, how much of today\\u2019s ongoing ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 that is, defined and named prior to the wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to telecom/WiFi radiation (or even the whole radiation gamut to which we expose ourselves)?\\n\\nIf officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\nThus even for EMF-sick users \\u2014 who are much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors (oblivious) attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\nBut quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 is what must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\nManifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere (see The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026).\\n\\nIf we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\nOf the several historical documents acknowledging the deleterious effects of artificial electromagnetic fields denied by FCC, the definitive one for wireless tech seems to be a 1981 World Health Organization (WHO) report entitled Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973. (I\\u2019ve always thought it unfortunate and instructive that \\u201cenvironmental health\\u201d is not about techno-human torment of Earth, but concern about just payback for the tormentor).\\n\\nThe report is long, covering many aspects. It covers all telecom/WiFi frequencies, including MMW; but real-world harm for the last three decades has come, and continues from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\nAs forthright as the WHO publication purports to be, the Summary reveals a distressing ruthlessness. It\\u2019s all most people need to read to understand that \\u2018they\\u2019 knew. For reader convenience, a brief review follows.\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.3 Biological effects in experimental animals: It has been demonstrated that low-level, long-term exposure may induce effects in the nervous, haematopoietic (production of blood cells and platelets), and immuno-competent cell systems of animals. Such effects have been reported in small animals (rodents) exposed to incident power density levels as low as 0.1-1.0 mW/cm2\\u201d (\\u201cmW\\u201d = milliwatt \\u2013 one thousandth of a watt). So this is one tenth of one thousandth of a watt to one thousandth of a watt per square centimeter. FCC limit: one thousandth of a watt \\u2013 1 mW/cm2 (for frequencies 1500 MHz \\u2013 100 GHz).\\n\\n\\u201cThe reported effects on the nervous system include behavioural, bioelectrical, metabolic, and structural (at the cellular and subcellular levels) changes. Erythrocyte production and haemaglobin synthesis may be impaired and immunological reactivity changed.\\u201d OK so far (except for exploiting/hurting animals).\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.6: Health risk evaluation as a basis for exposure limits: \\u2026 A highly conservative approach would be to keep exposure limits close to natural background levels. However, this is not technically feasible [emphasis added]. A reasonable risk-benefit analysis has to be considered.\\u201d\\n\\nIs \\u201chighly conservative\\u201d a euphemism for \\u201csafe\\u201d? And what does \\u201cclose\\u201d mean? In any case, the \\u201cbackground level,\\u201c called the cosmic background is 0.0000000001 \\u2013 0.000000000000001 \\u00b5W/cm2 (\\u00b5W = microwatt \\u2013 one millionth of a watt). Thus, the higher background limit (first one) is one ten billionth of a millionth of a watt (sounds like just a few electrons to me \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nFCC limit is on the other side of the decimal point at 1000 \\u00b5W/cm2. a thousand millionths of a watt \\u2013 per square centimeter, that is. Frankly, the author\\u2019s head goes into a spin with these minuscule decimals, but it\\u2019s safe to say there\\u2019s a bit of a margin between FCC and Cosmos \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nThe FCC limit is outrageous even compared to the most conservative proposed \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit: .003 \\u2013 .006 \\u00b5W/cm2. and the BioInitiative Report authors say it might even need to be lower..\\n\\nImportantly, however, the cosmic variety is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed). That means there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limit after all: zero.\\n\\n\\u201cNot technically feasible\\u201d? Well, of course. Technology is more important than health in some minds. \\u201cReasonable risk-benefit\\u201d? The Summary doesn\\u2019t say how many sick or dead per million is reasonable. (Please see also)\\n\\nOne wonders if they were aware of earlier studies, referred to by Andrew Michrowski, PhD at the 2009 Toronto Whole Life Expo (see section, Key Testimony in Toronto in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMichrowski interprets the data for us: \\u201cAnalysis of 1950 -1974 mortality of 40,000 Korean War veterans shows that microwave exposure effect is cumulative [emphasis added] it affects all deaths \\u2026 doubling to tripling cancers of eye, brain and central nervous system, lymphatic and hematopoietic [blood-cell/platelet-forming] and digestive systems. This means that even \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures from wireless systems accumulate over the years and decades to engender serious diseases\\u201d (can\\u2019t be said too often).\\n\\nNor do we know if the Warsaw International Symposium or its WHO reviewers were aware that the US military and others conducted microwave stealth-weapon research in the 1950s. This technology became 2G. See Sections Assault: From Weapon to Telecom and Ultimate Atrocity in the Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nOpposition warnings frequently emphasize \\u2018protecting you and your family.\\u2019 The point having been made several times is worth repeating: The most dire threat is to the ecosystem, not humans. No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\nEnvironment usually suffers in the background of hysteria. One will see lists something like this: \\u201chealth, privacy, security, and the environment.\\u201d\\n\\nThose who offer exposure \\u201csolutions\\u201d or \\u201ctips\\u201d seem to forget that no form or amount of human protection does so for Nature. A false sense of security in being \\u201csafer\\u201d leads to continued use and support of the overall system, immeasurably intensifying that threat.\\n\\nInsects, for example, are highly susceptible to telecom/WiFi microwave, especially to MMW, which we haven\\u2019t even had yet. In the last quarter century or so, coinciding closely with the introduction of 2G, 75% of the biomass of insects has disappeared in otherwise protected areas in Germany. Meaning it\\u2019s probably worse where other threats co-exist.\\n\\nEmphatically: The wireless threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. We need to look at the context of wireless, which is technology, per se. And one thing is certain about most of that, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\nIn almost all cases, somewhere along the line from resource acquisition (especially mining) to manufacture, use, and disposal, advanced technology is chemically/energetically toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless encompasses the entire line of a process of Earth liquidation/sacrifice for human \\u201cneeds\\u201d \\u2013 money, convenience, and entertainment (see section The Price of Techno-Civilization in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMoving to \\u201cwired\\u201d telecom/WiFi will not stop this assault. Countries are under siege for resources. Nor will the Elite psyops \\u201cSustainable Development\\u201d and \\u201cClean Renewable Energy\\u201d stop it. But that\\u2019s another article.\\n\\nThe attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed. I ask that anyone who can name a major environmental or health crisis in which technology isn\\u2019t the cause or doesn\\u2019t play a major role, comment about it.\\n\\nLooking at the overall output of \\u201cconcerned\\u201d EMF scientists and activists, however, if one isn\\u2019t careful, one could conclude it\\u2019s thought that humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\nAnother major concern is disproportionate attention on local antennas, while a massive satellite program proceeds. At one point, up to 20,000 satellites were planned to blanket the globe. But the number keeps growing.\\n\\nMadman Elon Musk\\u2019s SpaceX had dibs on 12,000 for 5Gmmw. Here is news that Madman is applying for 30,000 more. Just 42,000 satellites will be about 5 times the total spacecraft launched since 1957 (8,500).\\n\\nSeveral other companies, including Boeing, OneWeb, Amazon, Facebook, not to mention Russia and China, mean many thousands more. Total madness could bring it to somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000. This considered sane. Why? Because insanity unrecognized as such has become the norm in the culture of toxic-technomasturbation.\\n\\nPollution. Some 150 tons of refined kerosene and 340 tons of liquid oxygen per Musk 5G launch (60 satellites, 400 kg each). Do the math, even for 12,000. There seems to be no concern for consequences, such as potential damage to the ozone layer, major interference with earth\\u2019s energy field, or even increased atmospheric CO2 (for the faithful). Not to mention, decline of breathable free oxygen (very cool dynamic graph).\\n\\nMuch seems to be up in the air on the satellite program. Since launches proceed in haste, the plan seems to be shoot them up first, answer proprietary questions later, dismissing anyone else\\u2019s. In Europe, there are currently calls for papers on satellite integration with 5G, with submissions deadline being the Ides of March 2020.\\n\\nNASA, NOAA, meteorologists, (and radio astronomers) have issued valid concerns about MMW. FCC has dismissed them, too. Yet, NASA intends to participate in this bit of insanity.\\n\\nMight such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates? Insane is a good word for it, but psychopathic puts a more specific tag on it. See subsections Same Old Story\\u2026 and \\u2026with a Twist in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nThe best way to beat 5G, on the ground at least, is to quit wireless tech flat. Little demand \\u2018down here\\u2019 could greatly reduce incentive to invest \\u2018up there\\u2019. If there is a total-surveillance and human-control system gestating in the technosphere, how much of a role could satellites play?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strongly suggested that an outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the one on earthbound antennas.\\n\\nTaking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\nAgain, a race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse.

Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts.

Safety testing, history of official awareness of harm, and opposition priorities are also discussed.\\n\\nTwo Summaries have been published separately for fast-trackers. A Bullet Summary for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose detail, and a Text Summary, for those who want a more general sweep. Both provide means for quickly accessing areas of particular interest. But reading the full text is strongly encouraged. A small number of revisions might not appear in the Summaries.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\nWithout any help from \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers, the \\u201cnext generation\\u201d wireless is very dangerous \\u2014 all by itself \\u2014 as is each previous G by itself. But due to hysteria (illogic, inaccuracies and omissions), most opposition is also dangerous by itself.\\n\\nNot much has changed since this PC Mag article was published in 1/2019. And that doesn\\u2019t cover all critical aspects.\\n\\nConfusion begins right off the bat with the term \\u201c5G.\\u201d It\\u2019s being flung carelessly about, in articles, protests, news reports, corporate bulletins, by politicians \\u2013 even by scientists, and in submissions and comments to official bodies.\\n\\nAlmost always implied when \\u201c5G\\u201d is uttered \\u2013 especially, \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d or \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d \\u2013 is use of the \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This causes misunderstanding and potential danger.\\n\\nOverall, EHF is specified as 30 GHz to 300 GHz, and wavelength 10 millimeters to 1mm respectively. Only a small portion of that range is used in high-frequency 5G operation, and is defined in the US by the FCC as 24 GHz to 90 GHz.\\n\\nAs explained below in 5G Rollouts, for accuracy one must at least distinguish between 1) \\u2018small-cell\\u2019 infrastructure and 5G/small cells per se; 2) between 5G infrastructure and 5G high-frequency radiation; 3) between antennas and their enclosures, and **4) between high frequency 5G and mid-/low-band 5G, the signaling long used for 2G-4G iterations.\\n\\nNew terms are offered here for consistency and for clarifying hysteria-induced misunderstanding and confusion: \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d is a housing for antennas (sending/receiving elements). A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\nOne might see warnings such as: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSmall cell\\u201d is regularly misused, even by the Industry. Accurately speaking, a cell is not an antenna, but the effective area/range of an antenna\\u2019s radiation. 5Gmmw has a short range, which decreases with higher frequency. Thus, its cell is comparatively small.\\n\\nAlso, MMW can easily be blocked, even by even leaves and heavy rain, which deficiency increases with increasing frequency. Both drawbacks can be improved with a substantial power boost, but this also becomes a problem with energy cost and exposure levels, and so is not under consideration. Energy consumption is a major concern for the industry, which is feverishly at work to solve it.\\n\\nShort range and easy \\u2018blockability\\u2019 require more fixture locations, which hysteria frets about, rarely noting the distinction that 5Gmlb makes a large cell and is not blocked. Call it nitpicking if you will, but why not be accurate instead of creating misconception or \\u2018making cases\\u2019?\\n\\n\\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density, and common hysteria about how it will be implemented are in serious question (more later).\\n\\nOne interesting discovery came up while working on this article: Small cells are small but not new, and were not developed for 5G. Small cells have long been deployed in 3G and 4G networks and have become an industry choice to deliver MMW and enable better MLB performance if needed.\\n\\nTraditionally, there have been three types of small cells (more now), identified as they should be by antenna range. Some early deployments were in the US in 2007 and in the UK and Europe in 2009. \\u201cAccording to Small Cell Forum (who would have thought?), 18 million small cells had been deployed globally for various applications by the end of 2016.\\u201d\\n\\nBut haven\\u2019t we been led in a virtually deliberate way from the outset, and even continue to be, to think that 5G is small cells/MMW? Saying \\u201c5G\\u201d to indicate only these two things, or not specifying what you mean, is irresponsible, inaccurate, and misleading, as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nA 10/8/19 bulletin from Project Censored was forwarded to me via an email group that received it from Joel M. Moskowitz, PhD, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at UC Berkeley. A typically careless statement consisting of an error and a question mark says, \\u201cThe telecom industry is promoting the replacement of the current cellular network, known as 4G, with a new generation of higher frequency 5G wavelengths to power the \\u201cInternet of Things\\u2026\\u201d As a generalization, this is either shameful unawareness of the current scenario or untruth/propaganda, as we\\u2019ll also see.\\n\\n5G opposition also asserts that the skin\\u2019s (spiral) sweat ducts act as \\u201creceiving antennas.\\u201d This refers to an Israeli study, \\u201cThe human skin as a sub-THz receiver \\u2013 Does 5G pose a danger to it or not?\\u201d\\n\\nFrequency ranges don\\u2019t transition abruptly, but sub-THz usually means a range of 300 GHz down to 90, which is the upper end of FCC 5Gmmw.\\n\\nThe study Abstract uses two unquantified terms, \\u201csub-terahertz band\\u201d and \\u201csub-THz region.\\u201d I think \\u201cregion\\u201d is more accurate, meaning the range, or \\u201cspectrum\\u201d as understood in tech circles. \\u201cBand\\u201d is used to designate a single frequency, but also is an interval between a lower and upper frequency. For instance, a transmission between 40 and 50 MHz is a 10 MHz band (width).\\n\\nStudy frequencies were 75 GHz to 110 GHz. No wireless provider I\\u2019m aware of (in the US) has announced a mobile 5Gmmw service anywhere near 75 GHz. There was no explanation in the Abstract why announced commercial frequencies were not used.\\n\\nPower-level exposure limits at the user end are expressed in watts per area, usually square meter or square centimeter. No such levels are provided for the targets used, but maybe that\\u2019s not relevant in this case.\\n\\nThe highest commercial frequency I could find being tested is in the UK (though also approved for US), is 60 GHz. At least one rural test area is reportedly using a 60 GHz \\u201cwireless mesh\\u201d (interior network of interacting antennas) for \\u2018super WiFi.\\u2019 Not for mobile and still not up to 75 GHz.\\n\\nInteresting is that other UK rural testbeds are running unused TV bands called \\u201cTV white space\\u201d \\u2014 the old VHF to UHF frequencies, mostly MHz bands. This is 5G, mind you.\\n\\nHowever, bandwidths 71 to 76 GHz, 81 to 86 GHz and 92 to 95 GHz are available in the US for \\u201chigh-density\\u201d (high power) \\u201cfixed wireless access\\u201d services: \\u201c\\u2026the operation of wireless communication devices or systems used to connect two fixed locations (e.g., building to building or tower to building) with a radio or other wireless link\\u2026\\u201d, which would have to be line-of-sight and are not for mobile.\\n\\nAs noted, the higher the frequency, the greater are transmission challenges, so high-density bands would be very tight beams, with minimal to no obstacles and no human exposure (watch out, pigeons). Due to excess electricity consumption, MMW signals probably won\\u2019t be power boosted sufficiently to penetrate buildings, but be brought in via cable from an external receiver, then be distributed via a wireless network.\\n\\nStudy conclusion: \\u201cWe are raising a warning flag against the unrestricted use of sub-THz technologies for communication, before the possible consequences for public health are explored.\\u201d This seems sane enough \\u2013 within the insane context called wireless telecom/WiFi. See Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (needs updating).\\n\\nBut \\u201cunrestricted\\u201d at least suggests the impossible, that restrictions could prevent all trouble. Note also \\u201cpossible consequences.\\u201d This can\\u2019t be valid for harm in general, which is a fact long understood \\u2013 almost three decades before 2G came out (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\nWhen this warning is given, we don\\u2019t hear that the \\u201cwarning flag\\u201d would apply conceptually to all G\\u2019s; presumes there is a safe dose of MLB somewhere; and, as usual, neglects the ecosystem. But \\u2014 enough for protesters to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas? Making cases? I confess I fell for this one in my early research on wireless. A more likely, but still speculative, concern is discussed in Reports of \\u201c5G\\u201d Harm.\\n\\nAnother common warning, \\u201c5G is a weapon,\\u201d usually refers to the military\\u2019s Active Denial System, a \\u201cnon-lethal\\u201d microwave device for dispersing crowds by heating the skin. It\\u2019s a high density (power) millimeter wave at 95 GHz \\u2013 hardly commercial 5Gmmw.\\n\\nMMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G. Wireless telecom, beginning with 2G, is adapted stealth-weapon technology which uses very low power. The entire wireless system, not just \\u201c5G\\u201d, is a potential weapon on various levels (more below).\\n\\nAlso, high-enough density microwave \\u2014 at a \\u2018lowly\\u2019 2.5 GHz, for example \\u2014 will cook you like a microwave oven (2.45 GHz). That is, through and through, unlike ADS. At commercial power levels, 5Gmmw will not.\\n\\nA powerful Air Force radar system called Pave Paws at three US locations will cook you in a nanosecond at 420 to 450 MHz. Installations have two large circular arrays of antenna elements, each array radiating 580 kilowatts (!) It can detect a basketball at 12 miles, and small planes caught in the beam have blown up. So don\\u2019t swallow the rhetoric about telecom MMW weaponry.\\n\\nI was unable to find a range of ADS power output, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study calling out 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2) at 94 GHz (see Reports of Harm). ADS power is adjustable, however, enough to be used as a lethal weapon. But \\u2013 \\u2018making cases\\u2019 again?\\n\\nMicrowave ovens operate from 600 to 1200 watts. By comparison, maximum output of traditional cell towers is 10 watts \\u2013 phones, 2 watts. The higher frequency/shorter wavelength was chosen for ADS to limit penetration depth. Not saying that\\u2019s a good thing, not to mention it\\u2019s misleading (see Reports of Harm).\\n\\nFinding a wattage output figure for new, 5G MLB or MMW antennas proved fruitlessly time consuming (anyone?), but I did find a study establishing a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for a particular 5Gmmw antenna design for 28 and 38 GHz.\\n\\nSAR is an expression of how much radiation from a phone is absorbed over time by the body. It\\u2019s expressed in watts per kilogram (W/kg). Values were \\u201c\\u20260.37 and 1.34 W/kg [up to] 2 W/kg. Current FCC SAR standard is 1.6W/kg. This is given just for a sense of comparison, because SAR is useless for determining the amount of radiofrequency (RF) absorption in biosystems during typical conditions of use. See Safety Testing below.\\n\\nMany opposers suggest that 3G/4G/WiFi can be made reasonably safe. Others understand that impossibility, but seem too habituated and addicted to do the right thing. As noted in the Introduction, techno-humans are adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\n\\u201cNo \\u20185G\\u2019 safety studies have been conducted or funded by the Federal Communications Commission or the telecom industry, and none is planned.\\u201d Or simply, \\u201c5G has not been tested for safety\\u201d. Or the like. No such claims provide the facts.\\n\\nThat the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d terror, whereas, the real terror is wireless tech per se. Inherent in this ploy is the erroneous implication that 2G-4G were tested (a yes and no proposition).\\n\\nIn 1996, FCC adopted the standard identified as ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992. There were \\u2018window dressings\\u2019 in 2004, 2005, and 2010, and, like the original, covered frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019. (Overall \\u2018microwave\\u2019 is considered to be 300 MHz (.3 GHz) to 300 GHz.\\n\\nThe Commission\\u2019s assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is based on the fraudulent IEEE \\u2018testing\\u2019 it adopted in 1996 to run interference for 3G. That is, if the radiation doesn\\u2019t heat you, it can\\u2019t harm you.\\n\\nThis author warned of this response by FCC in February 2019 as \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria was powering up: Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised? Exposure limits worldwide are based on the ANSI/IEEE C95.1 fraud.\\n\\nPeer reviewed independent science, as early as the 1950s and still going, demonstrating myriad effects at non-heating levels, brings the integrity of C95.1-1992 through 2019 into question. Was *proper* testing ever done? Instead of clarifying this, hysteria makes the blanket claim. Making cases.\\n\\nThe FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science and such questions: \\u2018No convincing evidence exists, but we\\u2019re keeping an eye on it.\\u2019 The blatant criminality of the FCC with respect to wireless/EMF is clearly demonstrated by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nHysteria often resorts to another \\u2018ploy on words\\u2019 pertaining to 2G-4G, and used even by scientists, as seen near the end of this report: \\u201cThe current FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d The word implies that standards were at one time valid or sufficient, when they were never any such thing, for any living thing.\\n\\n\\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing has been demonstrated or can exist. Despite this, new limits are proposed and stubbornly called for \\u2014 in spite of the consensus that no safe level has even been published for fetuses.\\n\\nApparently, that\\u2019s not of sufficient concern to call for \\u201cStop Wireless Technology!\\u201d instead of \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d We\\u2019ll figure that fetus part out later.\\n\\nFor details on the original \\u2018safety\\u2019 testing \\u2013 scientific fraud, that is, on which power-level exposure limits worldwide are based \\u2013 see Sections Cell Phone Output and Exposure Limits for Users in the article Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\nMajor emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA,\\u2019 due to the short range and easy block-ability of MMW. But things seem to be developing differently for now, as we\\u2019ll see. As noted, even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\nThe following synthesis is the result of wading through too many articles to give credit to any one. Some sources tell varying stories about the same thing, and even disagree with each other considerably.\\n\\nSo here goes: A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard has been issued, specifying two frequency ranges: 5G NR bands FR1 & 5G NR bands FR2. Number one is for current bands below 6 GHz (5Gmlb), such as 600MHz, 1900MHz, and 2.5GHz; two is for MMW \\u2014 mostly 24 to 40 GHz for mobile, and higher for special applications (not mobile). In the near term, public WiFi will remain separate at MLB, 2.45 GHz and 5 GHz, but Verizon, for example, is offering 5Gmmw home internet/WiFi (not mobile) in limited areas of four cities.\\n\\n5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention at this point, including especially \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and \\u2018beamforming\\u2019 (more later).\\n\\nHowever, 5G NR FR1 can use the same towers as 4G, but will need new antennas. It has the same reach and penetration, but with shorter delay, while providing up to 35 percent more speed. The wireless addict\\u2019s dream. When you think about it, FR1 should really be 5G, and 5Gmmw, 6G.\\n\\nPlans are also in place for deployments using the unlicensed, Citizens Broadband Radio Service 3.5 GHz band, and all key players really want in. This is MLB called 5G, mind you.\\n\\nThings get a bit stickier when it comes to needing a new phone or not. Many current phones should be able to get updates to process FR1, but a new phone is needed for FR2. Generally, the \\u201ctech\\u201d advice is not to move yet, and here\\u2019s an example with Samsung\\u2019s $1300 5G Galaxy S10 being tested in Chicago (good shot of a 5Gmmw \\u201cnode\\u201d here).\\n\\nThe \\u201chold off\\u201d sentiment is conveyed also in this article. What it amounts to at this writing is that 5Gmmw is virtually at a \\u201cdemo\\u201d stage, not full coverage and service, even in town.\\n\\nMany \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers continue to use traditional 3G/4G/WiFi wireless, either knowing the danger or believing it\\u2019s safe, or will be, because they just want it. A possible motive driving hysteria?\\n\\nAnother possible motive for \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, or maybe just the effect it\\u2019s having, is to create a threat on the ground to draw resistance and to distract attention from the satellite program, a much more sinister development (see Examining Priorities below).\\n\\nThe disconnect about dangers brings up a story that drew wide attention at the time, especially in the UK, and one that seems to present a puzzle. It\\u2019s about the 6/26 2019 Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, Somerset County, England. It\\u2019s not strictly a \\u201crollout\\u201d story, more a system demo/test, but a decision was announced about installing \\u201c5G\\u201d network towers on festival grounds,\\n\\nDespite the fact that \\u201cGlastonbury officials [said] that move will allow festival attendees to access the Internet on their smartphones at faster speeds,\\u201d the announcement created a huge protest. In this story, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G are mentioned, but \\u201c5G\\u201d is not specified as MLB or MMW \\u2014 as anything, in other words. Is this hysteria-induced negligence?\\n\\nThe protest article is laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated one that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d. Even some much-admired professional associates/contacts promote this irresponsible notion. I must respectfully, but strongly, disagree, because the erroneous implication is that 2G-4G were/are not an experiment. Paradoxically, they were/are and were/are not experiments. Distinctions must be made (more below).\\n\\nConfusion again: \\u201cWhile obviously not many festival-goers are likely to have a \\u20185G\\u2019 phone by June, EE will be showing off what the network can do at its stand.\\u201d Once again, unspecified 5G. So, was the Glastonbury demo about 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb? Whatever, tickets sold out in less than 45 minutes.\\n\\nThe grand protest by potential attendees was both tragic and macabrely amusing: They were prepared to irradiate themselves constantly in huge numbers (up to 200,000 fans in attendance potentially using phones/smartphones), but fretted over \\u201c5G\\u201d, not even knowing it could have been their beloved 4G poison\\u2026reborn. Phone radiation is often overlooked.\\n\\nSimilarly, reports on the 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland clearly reflect the confusion and negligent use of \\u201c5G.\\u201d This Agence France-Presse story says, \\u201cBy early July, 334 antennae (sic) stations for 5G were operational across the country, authorities have told AFP.\\u201d Boy, watch out for authorities.\\n\\nAntenna location and density info aren\\u2019t revealed, but it could be urban or \\u2018near-urban.\\u2019 The number doesn\\u2019t seem to correspond to FLD in neighborhoods, but who knows, thanks to incomplete reporting (and perhaps misled authorities). The news reader is therefore in the dark about exactly what\\u2019s going on, but probably assumes it\\u2019s MMW. Due to\\u2026 \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s (but beginning much earlier). What was known then was later hushed in the runup to digital mobile telecom in 1991-2.\\n\\nThe decision was callously made long ago to put life/people at risk to have the technology (see History of Official Awareness below). Thus, the yes/no \\u201cexperiment\\u201d is not whether there will be harm from telecom/WiFi microwave, but the time window in which ongoing exposure damage \\u2014 across all frequencies and regardless of power level \\u2014 will manifest in a cascade of widespread intractable illness.\\n\\nNot to worry, though, that fate might be avoided: Ecosystem collapse could bring the house down beforehand. You might hear/see, \\u201cThe 5G race is on,\\u201d meaning market competition. The race of note, though, is between ecosystem collapse and human-health collapse.\\n\\nIn any case, here\\u2019s some of what\\u2019s happening in \\u2018real\\u2019 life. The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon. Carriers are choosing service areas for FR1, FR2 very carefully.\\n\\nT-Mobile has announced a nationwide 5Gmlb rollout at 600 MHz and an undisclosed application of \\u201c28 and 39\\u201d (see video), which means some 5Gmmw, almost certainly in cities.\\n\\nSprint\\u2019s plans are to run \\u201cLTE and 5G\\u201d simultaneously in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\nMentioned earlier, Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d (allegedly MMW \\u2013 5Gmmw) is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range to cover wide area\\u201d (5Gmlb), doesn\\u2019t say where.\\n\\nSacramento seems to be the most enthusiastic victim host for wireless. Here\\u2019s a gushing PR piece about a Verizon UWB installation at one Sacramento citizen\\u2019s home, with City officials attending. It features an external receiver. Sacramento also prides itself on opening the floodgates for \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more later).\\n\\nVerizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas, which could be its final destination. Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason. Ecocidal, terminally pathological 3G/4G still rages, again reflecting the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nThe forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. As noted earlier, drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for \\u201c18 million new\\u201d closely spaced fixtures nationwide. Given the above information on FR1 rollouts, there seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\nA report on new Qualcomm smartphone antennas supports the foregoing. It covers four bands between 26.5GHz and 40 GHz, but also antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 The QPM56xx RF module family works with the Snapdragon X50 modem to work in the sub-6GHz bands\\u2026\\u201d (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\nOne puzzle: It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) as specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs seem to disagree, saying 4G can handle IoT. Propaganda? Careless chatter? Who knows. It\\u2019s safe to assume, however, they refer to the new 4G/5Gmlb.\\n\\nSome opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. And the attempted widespread deployment of smart utility meters on 4G WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say. 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, because if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\nI didn\\u2019t bother spending the rest of my life trying to find if/where FLD installations are occurring. Anyone who\\u2019s seen close installations in any area, please share details in Comments.\\n\\nNow, if FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose. One, possibility of course, is optimized 5Gmlb performance, as in the past, although this shouldn\\u2019t often be necessary, due to the large cell and penetration of MLB.\\n\\nIn the entrained, FLD frame of mind, I was suspicious in Wireless Technology: \\u2026 (The 5G Locomotive section) of Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams\\u2019 statement in a 5/15/18 CNBC interview that antennas in your face is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019d say he was being coy, implying MLB, and being careful not to depict 5G accurately, since 5Gmmw must have increased FLD, while 5Gmlb, not for the most part.\\n\\nMcAdam touted 5Gmmw for smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality, all good reasons for planetary and health destruction. But remember, all the \\u201cSmart\\u201d out there now is WiFi, for which there is no 5Gmmw (although Verizon\\u2019s UWB Home Internet might qualify). \\u201cSmart\\u201d is the wireless tech word for monumentally stupid \\u2014 and for total surveillance and centralized coordination and control of daily life. See section The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026.\\n\\nNone of the above means things can\\u2019t change. It\\u2019s early. The MLB rollout could be just a prelude to an FLD/MMW invasion. If MMW gets a toe-hold and no one\\u2019s coming up provably sick, and people like it, it could weaken opposition and open floodgates.\\n\\nAnd there\\u2019s the question of how the many thousands of planned satellites (looking now like well more than 50,000) fit into the overall picture. Obviously, coverage comes immediately to mind, such as saturation in outlying areas? For IoT? One issue for satellites, though, is increased delay time (\\u201clatency\\u201d) due to distance. There could be a \\u2018division of labor\\u2019 among various services, such as ground for mobile and sats for entertainment.\\n\\nNote the promise of the nationwide sySTEMic programming to make kids into corporate plug-ins or hitech drones: \\u201cSTEM education emphasizes the value of a rigorous, interdisciplinary approach to education, allowing students to compete and succeed in a modern global marketplace.\\u201d How many dubious assumptions, claims and buzzwords in that PR flak?\\n\\nSTEM promises a wondrous, prosperous, techno-shiny future. It exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. In the developed world, the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum total of the latter. Speaking of which, once a city is immersed in \\u201csmart\\u201d tech, it\\u2019s likely to become a special target of hackers. Imagine the potential chaos.)\\n\\nThere have been various reports of adverse effects when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, almost certainly implying 5Gmmw. This would seem unlikely, virtually impossible, outside cities/populous areas.\\n\\nApparently, people see new infrastructure dense or not, or/and feel effects, and apparently assume MMW is in use, as we saw in the Bern example.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d harm stories consistently report symptoms existing before anyone even heard of 5G. Long before. All reported harms I\\u2019ve seen are classic 2G-4G symptoms, and mostly of the \\u2018Electrohypersensitivity\\u2019 type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\nRadiation/RF-level meters have been used to support claims. But RF meters don\\u2019t display frequencies, only power level within a range of frequencies. Ordinary meters, costing from around $120 to $400, top out at 8 GHz. 3G/4G mobile frequencies range from 600 megahertz to 2.5 GHz in the US, with 3.5 GHz coming. WiFi is 2.4 and 5 GHz. Recall, FCC defines 5Gmmw as 24 GHz to 90 GHz. Thus, current meters can\\u2019t read MMW.\\n\\nA true 5G phone would identify MMW (and MLB at this point). Professional (very expensive) meters cover low and high ranges into the upper GHz (I found one 10 MHz to 220 GHz), but also don\\u2019t display frequencies, so all frequencies present still couldn\\u2019t be identified.\\n\\nLong-term exposure, perhaps a cumulative effect, is playing into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Thus, if there is harm when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, what\\u2019s shown by existing meters? Not understood by victims and reporters? 4G, one way or another. Hysteria-induced confusion.\\n\\nOne hawker claims its meter can read \\u201c5G\\u201d based on the fact that two new MLB frequencies are used for 5G (mlb). Any old meter does this. This ruse brought to you by \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nMeters are interesting, but not really helpful for most people. Radiation is everywhere; no amount of exposure is safe; most bio-effects below heating are power-independent; and effects may be cumulative (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nA meter might come in handy for someone with outward symptoms and using some form of shielding, for example. It could be seen at what level symptoms abate \\u2013 which doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops. Most likely, it\\u2019s palliation, but it can still save much grief and help people function.\\n\\nWe can come to cautious conclusion about the frequency present by type of effect. Known effects of MMW (a limited volume of science, though growing) differ from MLB effects long reported in the voluminous dismissed science.\\n\\nMMW potentially threatens skin and eyes, but more effects are being reported, although sometimes \\u2018stretched.\\u2019 For example, a paper cited (in an article by a prominent scientist who must remain anonymous) to show that 5Gmmw impacts \\u201cheart rate variability\\u201d was a military directed-energy study (see Author Information) using 94 GHz at 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2). That\\u2019s essentially the \\u201cADS\\u201d system noted earlier.\\n\\nNot only is 75 mW 75 times the main FCC limit (limits vary with frequency), but 94 is a frequency higher than the upper limit of 5Gmmw defined by the FCC, and certainly wouldn\\u2019t be used in mobile applications. Making cases?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not that MMW can\\u2019t create MLB effects, but it\\u2019s a bit speculative at this point. It\\u2019s possible, however \\u201c\\u2026since nerves, blood vessels and other electrically conducting structures can carry radiation-induced currents deep into the body\\u201d (see section 5G is qualitatively and quantitatively different from 4G)\\n\\nAntenna technology called MIMO (pron. my-mo) has been around for about a decade now for MLB. The more recent development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, meaning many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming (and receiving) beams of radiation. It looks to be destined for both FR1 and FR2 (a virtual necessity for MMW). As noted, Sprint will use this at for 5G at 3.5 GHz.\\n\\nOne question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose an additional threat. It\\u2019s possible they have an effect different from traditional antennas. Also, it seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of many focused beams, although being immersed in a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\nIn any case, aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying a beam from point to point (line of sight) avoids high power output per beam, since penetration of intervening structures isn\\u2019t required.\\n\\nHysteria often warns of outrageously high power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d As noted, effects occur at all levels below heating, which is why 3G/4G need to go. And it would not behoove the industry for people to suddenly be suffering heat damage.\\n\\nDetails of several typical news reports follow. Most demonstrate the fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one shows a more general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\nThe story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from a Verizon antenna installed near the home illustrates confusion. The first video on this page shows testimony before the Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with the mayor present.\\n\\nThe type of antenna isn\\u2019t given. But it\\u2019s probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. We learned from the \\u201cgushing PR piece\\u201d cited in the 5G Rollouts section that Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strange that the testimony date precedes the stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests prior to the grand \\u201cunveiling,\\u201d so it could have been an early \\u201cHome\\u201d antenna. Or maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\nThe opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that ambiguous statement mean to the person who wrote it? To the viewer? The incident suggests harm (cold/flu symptoms) from 5Gmmw but still reinforces the importance of knowing what we mean when we say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\nThe mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although her prepared speech commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but the suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness, even though levels \\u201care still very high\\u201d will certainly be taken officially as \\u201ccorrelation,\\u201d not proof or even evidence.\\n\\nTypically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\nBottom line: Which 5G is present is academic, since the pre-\\u201c5G\\u201d endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal. Focus on \\u201c5G\\u201d is like fretting about a wildfire 10 miles away while your house is burning down.\\n\\nOne of the more outrageous opposition-induced hysterias in recent times is a story from Gateshead, a town in northern UK near the North Sea, that new LED street lights (no microwave fixtures on them, just the lights) were emitting \\u201c5G\\u201d and causing health issues. This was carelessly picked up by other outlets. No one gave a moment\\u2019s thought to the likelihood that it might be LED lights themselves.\\n\\nA news report from Cincinnati clearly demonstrates that folks are in the dark about what 5G is, thanks to hysteria. And a fairly well-known one from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, to its credit, shows a better general awareness of wireless threat. But both demonstrate questionable thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make them safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem).\\n\\nScroll down this page to see an RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story. Regardless of one\\u2019s opinion of RT, this one\\u2019s a great and accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\nThe original story from 9/20/19 (now includes an update) is a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria,\\u201d since no one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers up to this point. It involves a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that \\u201cpeople fear\\u201d will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d.\\n\\nThe 9/27/19 update shows a video interview with a concerned nurse, a conditioned \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacking understanding of the wireless threat. She\\u2019ll feel safer if that nasty tall tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\nThe tall, new-look tower with the cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video) is clearly not the massive MIMO 5Gmmw/small-cell type shown in the 5G-phone report in the 5G Rollouts section. That was Verizon\\u2019s.\\n\\nThe update also says the tower is Sprint\\u2019s. As noted, Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using massive MIMO. It being a Sprint tower, it\\u2019s not MMW. The \\u201c5G\\u201d fear was an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\nSo what\\u2019s in the cylindrical fixture? Could be 4G (LTE), 5Gmlb (\\u201c5G\\u201d), WiFi as well? WiMax? One question \\u2013 is it MIMO? Massive? Anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\nThe update notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are also popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman David Weissmann confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what? From what we\\u2019ve seen of Verizon, probably 5Gmlb, i.e., 4G LTE on FR1 steroids.\\n\\nThe San Joaquin report, from 3/12/19 also concerns a tall tower with a cylindrical fixture. But this isn\\u2019t about 5G, but about \\u201ca cell tower\\u201d being too close to an elementary school in Ripon with a \\u2018cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\n\\u201cAll in all, three teachers and four students have been battling various cancers since 2016,\\u201d as well as a 22-year-old former male student. Of course, those teachers and that young man \\u2018never\\u2019 used a wireless device, and never near that tower. Nor were they exposed to another tower or anyone else\\u2019s phone. This doesn\\u2019t seem to dawn on people.\\n\\nThe Ripon case is interesting. An independent expert was consulted, who contradicted official assurance that the tower tested within federal standards. He said he wouldn\\u2019t send his kids there, because kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed \\u2013 as if they\\u2019re not exposed 24/7 anywhere a phone/tower system is working, not only from towers, but many phones as well. And does he think that once you\\u2019re \\u201cdeveloped\\u201d it\\u2019s OK?\\n\\nSprint subsequently shut it down and agreed to relocate, guilty or not. The move was good PR, and indicates that companies and municipalities will back down \\u2013 probably to avoid litigation, since that could open floodgates.\\n\\nRipon is important for two more reasons. The first is the usually overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure (see History of Official Awareness below). It\\u2019s well known, for example, that effects from cigarette tobacco and ionizing radiation (like a hospital X-ray), are cumulative. There\\u2019s no reason wireless radiation should be any different.\\n\\nMost kids are heavily exposed in our wireless world, wherever they are \\u2013 many from conception, and even before that, especially to ovarian DNA damage. This is one egregious crime of the technology.\\n\\nThe second reason is the bogus advice that \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the false argument for slow death over quicker death, or the futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can even make things worse. The farther the source, the greater are reflection and refraction of signals, creating a far more chaotic condition for the body to handle. Any telecom/WiFi antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\nReducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usually usage tips but also lower exposure limits. Despite calls for the latter, it holds mostly for heating. For non-heating effects, lower power could even increase the threat, since there\\u2019s a good chance that the closer we get to the minute power levels used by biosystems for intercellular communication, a greater confusion sets in.\\n\\nWith regard to usage tips, \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures accumulate over time to engender serious disease \\u2013 of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem, whose damage these clever warnings for humans worsen.\\n\\nThe problem is that reliance on power level alone to determine safety is largely a convenience (there\\u2019s that fatal word again), not science. The reader doesn\\u2019t need to understand the following terms, just that there are several factors in play, including whether the signal is continuous or pulsed, the shape of the pulsations, the rise time, fall time and duration of the pulsations, the type and depth of modulation, the frequencies, and the bandwidth.\\n\\nTry to set a \\u201csafe\\u201d exposure limit based on all that. So they keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\nA corollary is that folks claiming harm seem to think it\\u2019s for the first time. This is fatal error. There are also stories wherein people or animals affected by, say, a Smart meter, regard symptom abatement when the meter is removed as complete recovery. More fatal error. People have no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway. By now, the reader should know why.\\n\\nAn Idaho organization, ehsidaho.com, collects reports on the incidence and effects of what\\u2019s being called electrohypersensitivity, or EHS. The term is misleading, because no living thing is unaffected by the radiation, whether it manifests outwardly or not. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 is suggested.\\n\\nAn estimated 35% of the population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\nClaire Edwards, a former UN staffer, top writer and wireless activist said to me in an email that an estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. The rest of society is virtually thumbing its nose at these unfortunate people. But they\\u2019ll also suffer if this red flag is ignored: As bad as this sensitivity is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad, either in incidence or severity, as things could quickly and easily get.\\n\\nIllness caused by wireless radiation is not new or unique to it, even though there are lists and categories of issues attributed to it. In medicine, a symptom can be caused by any number of influences, and a single influence can cause various symptoms.\\n\\nSo a big question is, how much of today\\u2019s ongoing ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 that is, defined and named prior to the wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to telecom/WiFi radiation (or even the whole radiation gamut to which we expose ourselves)?\\n\\nIf officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\nThus even for EMF-sick users \\u2014 who are much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors (oblivious) attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\nBut quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 is what must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\nManifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere (see The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026).\\n\\nIf we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\nOf the several historical documents acknowledging the deleterious effects of artificial electromagnetic fields denied by FCC, the definitive one for wireless tech seems to be a 1981 World Health Organization (WHO) report entitled Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973. (I\\u2019ve always thought it unfortunate and instructive that \\u201cenvironmental health\\u201d is not about techno-human torment of Earth, but concern about just payback for the tormentor).\\n\\nThe report is long, covering many aspects. It covers all telecom/WiFi frequencies, including MMW; but real-world harm for the last three decades has come, and continues from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\nAs forthright as the WHO publication purports to be, the Summary reveals a distressing ruthlessness. It\\u2019s all most people need to read to understand that \\u2018they\\u2019 knew. For reader convenience, a brief review follows.\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.3 Biological effects in experimental animals: It has been demonstrated that low-level, long-term exposure may induce effects in the nervous, haematopoietic (production of blood cells and platelets), and immuno-competent cell systems of animals. Such effects have been reported in small animals (rodents) exposed to incident power density levels as low as 0.1-1.0 mW/cm2\\u201d (\\u201cmW\\u201d = milliwatt \\u2013 one thousandth of a watt). So this is one tenth of one thousandth of a watt to one thousandth of a watt per square centimeter. FCC limit: one thousandth of a watt \\u2013 1 mW/cm2 (for frequencies 1500 MHz \\u2013 100 GHz).\\n\\n\\u201cThe reported effects on the nervous system include behavioural, bioelectrical, metabolic, and structural (at the cellular and subcellular levels) changes. Erythrocyte production and haemaglobin synthesis may be impaired and immunological reactivity changed.\\u201d OK so far (except for exploiting/hurting animals).\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.6: Health risk evaluation as a basis for exposure limits: \\u2026 A highly conservative approach would be to keep exposure limits close to natural background levels. However, this is not technically feasible [emphasis added]. A reasonable risk-benefit analysis has to be considered.\\u201d\\n\\nIs \\u201chighly conservative\\u201d a euphemism for \\u201csafe\\u201d? And what does \\u201cclose\\u201d mean? In any case, the \\u201cbackground level,\\u201c called the cosmic background is 0.0000000001 \\u2013 0.000000000000001 \\u00b5W/cm2 (\\u00b5W = microwatt \\u2013 one millionth of a watt). Thus, the higher background limit (first one) is one ten billionth of a millionth of a watt (sounds like just a few electrons to me \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nFCC limit is on the other side of the decimal point at 1000 \\u00b5W/cm2. a thousand millionths of a watt \\u2013 per square centimeter, that is. Frankly, the author\\u2019s head goes into a spin with these minuscule decimals, but it\\u2019s safe to say there\\u2019s a bit of a margin between FCC and Cosmos \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nThe FCC limit is outrageous even compared to the most conservative proposed \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit: .003 \\u2013 .006 \\u00b5W/cm2. and the BioInitiative Report authors say it might even need to be lower..\\n\\nImportantly, however, the cosmic variety is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed). That means there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limit after all: zero.\\n\\n\\u201cNot technically feasible\\u201d? Well, of course. Technology is more important than health in some minds. \\u201cReasonable risk-benefit\\u201d? The Summary doesn\\u2019t say how many sick or dead per million is reasonable. (Please see also)\\n\\nOne wonders if they were aware of earlier studies, referred to by Andrew Michrowski, PhD at the 2009 Toronto Whole Life Expo (see section, Key Testimony in Toronto in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMichrowski interprets the data for us: \\u201cAnalysis of 1950 -1974 mortality of 40,000 Korean War veterans shows that microwave exposure effect is cumulative [emphasis added] it affects all deaths \\u2026 doubling to tripling cancers of eye, brain and central nervous system, lymphatic and hematopoietic [blood-cell/platelet-forming] and digestive systems. This means that even \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures from wireless systems accumulate over the years and decades to engender serious diseases\\u201d (can\\u2019t be said too often).\\n\\nNor do we know if the Warsaw International Symposium or its WHO reviewers were aware that the US military and others conducted microwave stealth-weapon research in the 1950s. This technology became 2G. See Sections Assault: From Weapon to Telecom and Ultimate Atrocity in the Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nOpposition warnings frequently emphasize \\u2018protecting you and your family.\\u2019 The point having been made several times is worth repeating: The most dire threat is to the ecosystem, not humans. No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\nEnvironment usually suffers in the background of hysteria. One will see lists something like this: \\u201chealth, privacy, security, and the environment.\\u201d\\n\\nThose who offer exposure \\u201csolutions\\u201d or \\u201ctips\\u201d seem to forget that no form or amount of human protection does so for Nature. A false sense of security in being \\u201csafer\\u201d leads to continued use and support of the overall system, immeasurably intensifying that threat.\\n\\nInsects, for example, are highly susceptible to telecom/WiFi microwave, especially to MMW, which we haven\\u2019t even had yet. In the last quarter century or so, coinciding closely with the introduction of 2G, 75% of the biomass of insects has disappeared in otherwise protected areas in Germany. Meaning it\\u2019s probably worse where other threats co-exist.\\n\\nEmphatically: The wireless threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. We need to look at the context of wireless, which is technology, per se. And one thing is certain about most of that, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\nIn almost all cases, somewhere along the line from resource acquisition (especially mining) to manufacture, use, and disposal, advanced technology is chemically/energetically toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless encompasses the entire line of a process of Earth liquidation/sacrifice for human \\u201cneeds\\u201d \\u2013 money, convenience, and entertainment (see section The Price of Techno-Civilization in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMoving to \\u201cwired\\u201d telecom/WiFi will not stop this assault. Countries are under siege for resources. Nor will the Elite psyops \\u201cSustainable Development\\u201d and \\u201cClean Renewable Energy\\u201d stop it. But that\\u2019s another article.\\n\\nThe attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed. I ask that anyone who can name a major environmental or health crisis in which technology isn\\u2019t the cause or doesn\\u2019t play a major role, comment about it.\\n\\nLooking at the overall output of \\u201cconcerned\\u201d EMF scientists and activists, however, if one isn\\u2019t careful, one could conclude it\\u2019s thought that humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\nAnother major concern is disproportionate attention on local antennas, while a massive satellite program proceeds. At one point, up to 20,000 satellites were planned to blanket the globe. But the number keeps growing.\\n\\nMadman Elon Musk\\u2019s SpaceX had dibs on 12,000 for 5Gmmw. Here is news that Madman is applying for 30,000 more. Just 42,000 satellites will be about 5 times the total spacecraft launched since 1957 (8,500).\\n\\nSeveral other companies, including Boeing, OneWeb, Amazon, Facebook, not to mention Russia and China, mean many thousands more. Total madness could bring it to somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000. This considered sane. Why? Because insanity unrecognized as such has become the norm in the culture of toxic-technomasturbation.\\n\\nPollution. Some 150 tons of refined kerosene and 340 tons of liquid oxygen per Musk 5G launch (60 satellites, 400 kg each). Do the math, even for 12,000. There seems to be no concern for consequences, such as potential damage to the ozone layer, major interference with earth\\u2019s energy field, or even increased atmospheric CO2 (for the faithful). Not to mention, decline of breathable free oxygen (very cool dynamic graph).\\n\\nMuch seems to be up in the air on the satellite program. Since launches proceed in haste, the plan seems to be shoot them up first, answer proprietary questions later, dismissing anyone else\\u2019s. In Europe, there are currently calls for papers on satellite integration with 5G, with submissions deadline being the Ides of March 2020.\\n\\nNASA, NOAA, meteorologists, (and radio astronomers) have issued valid concerns about MMW. FCC has dismissed them, too. Yet, NASA intends to participate in this bit of insanity.\\n\\nMight such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates? Insane is a good word for it, but psychopathic puts a more specific tag on it. See subsections Same Old Story\\u2026 and \\u2026with a Twist in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nThe best way to beat 5G, on the ground at least, is to quit wireless tech flat. Little demand \\u2018down here\\u2019 could greatly reduce incentive to invest \\u2018up there\\u2019. If there is a total-surveillance and human-control system gestating in the technosphere, how much of a role could satellites play?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strongly suggested that an outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the one on earthbound antennas.\\n\\nTaking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\nAgain, a race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse. Allowing classic 4G (or even just 5G FR1) to continue potentiates imminent disaster. Both scenarios are in progress, but at the \\u2018deniable\\u2019 stage. When \\u2018undeniable\\u2019 sets in, the slope will almost certainly have become too steep and slippery.\\n\\nExperience shows that science-based appeals, to governments at all levels; to national and international regulatory bodies, and so on is an exercise in futility due to multiple factors, including corruption, disbelief, and intimidation. Old and chronic conditions.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s in the People\\u2019s hands now, at the commercial level. Either common sense prevails over addiction and selfishness, or we wait for the race to end and hope it\\u2019s not too late.\\n\\nGive up wireless per se or give up the future \\u2013 liberty first, then life. If not, then welcome all 5G, especially the satellites. Surrender to it will mercifully shorten the coming agony.\\n\\nPeter Tocci is a retired massage therapist and wellness consultant with an abiding interest in exploring \\u2018managed\\u2019 history, nefarious covert agendas, and mainstream/mainstream-alternative news-media dereliction, distortion and suppression.

Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more like hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts.

Safety testing, history of official awareness of harm, and opposition priorities are also discussed.\\n\\nTwo Summaries have been published separately for fast-trackers. A Bullet Summary for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose detail, and a Text Summary, for those who want a more general sweep. Both provide means for quickly accessing areas of particular interest. But reading the full text is strongly encouraged. A small number of revisions might not appear in the Summaries.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\nWithout any help from \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers, the \\u201cnext generation\\u201d wireless is very dangerous \\u2014 all by itself \\u2014 as is each previous G by itself. But due to hysteria (illogic, inaccuracies and omissions), most opposition is also dangerous by itself.\\n\\nNot much has changed since this PC Mag article was published in 1/2019. And that doesn\\u2019t cover all critical aspects.\\n\\nConfusion begins right off the bat with the term \\u201c5G.\\u201d It\\u2019s being flung carelessly about, in articles, protests, news reports, corporate bulletins, by politicians \\u2013 even by scientists, and in submissions and comments to official bodies.\\n\\nAlmost always implied when \\u201c5G\\u201d is uttered \\u2013 especially, \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d or \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d \\u2013 is use of the \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This causes misunderstanding and potential danger.\\n\\nOverall, EHF is specified as 30 GHz to 300 GHz, and wavelength 10 millimeters to 1mm respectively. Only a small portion of that range is used in high-frequency 5G operation, and is defined in the US by the FCC as 24 GHz to 90 GHz.\\n\\nAs explained below in 5G Rollouts, for accuracy one must at least distinguish between 1) \\u2018small-cell\\u2019 infrastructure and 5G/small cells per se; 2) between 5G infrastructure and 5G high-frequency radiation; 3) between antennas and their enclosures, and **4) between high frequency 5G and mid-/low-band 5G, the signaling long used for 2G-4G iterations.\\n\\nNew terms are offered here for consistency and for clarifying hysteria-induced misunderstanding and confusion: \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d is a housing for antennas (sending/receiving elements). A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\nOne might see warnings such as: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSmall cell\\u201d is regularly misused, even by the Industry. Accurately speaking, a cell is not an antenna, but the effective area/range of an antenna\\u2019s radiation. 5Gmmw has a short range, which decreases with higher frequency. Thus, its cell is comparatively small.\\n\\nAlso, MMW can easily be blocked, even by even leaves and heavy rain, which deficiency increases with increasing frequency. Both drawbacks can be improved with a substantial power boost, but this also becomes a problem with energy cost and exposure levels, and so is not under consideration. Energy consumption is a major concern for the industry, which is feverishly at work to solve it.\\n\\nShort range and easy \\u2018blockability\\u2019 require more fixture locations, which hysteria frets about, rarely noting the distinction that 5Gmlb makes a large cell and is not blocked. Call it nitpicking if you will, but why not be accurate instead of creating misconception or \\u2018making cases\\u2019?\\n\\n\\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density, and common hysteria about how it will be implemented are in serious question (more later).\\n\\nOne interesting discovery came up while working on this article: Small cells are small but not new, and were not developed for 5G. Small cells have long been deployed in 3G and 4G networks and have become an industry choice to deliver MMW and enable better MLB performance if needed.\\n\\nTraditionally, there have been three types of small cells (more now), identified as they should be by antenna range. Some early deployments were in the US in 2007 and in the UK and Europe in 2009. \\u201cAccording to Small Cell Forum (who would have thought?), 18 million small cells had been deployed globally for various applications by the end of 2016.\\u201d\\n\\nBut haven\\u2019t we been led in a virtually deliberate way from the outset, and even continue to be, to think that 5G is small cells/MMW? Saying \\u201c5G\\u201d to indicate only these two things, or not specifying what you mean, is irresponsible, inaccurate, and misleading, as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nA 10/8/19 bulletin from Project Censored was forwarded to me via an email group that received it from Joel M. Moskowitz, PhD, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at UC Berkeley. A typically careless statement consisting of an error and a question mark says, \\u201cThe telecom industry is promoting the replacement of the current cellular network, known as 4G, with a new generation of higher frequency 5G wavelengths to power the \\u201cInternet of Things\\u2026\\u201d As a generalization, this is either shameful unawareness of the current scenario or untruth/propaganda, as we\\u2019ll also see.\\n\\n5G opposition also asserts that the skin\\u2019s (spiral) sweat ducts act as \\u201creceiving antennas.\\u201d This refers to an Israeli study, \\u201cThe human skin as a sub-THz receiver \\u2013 Does 5G pose a danger to it or not?\\u201d\\n\\nFrequency ranges don\\u2019t transition abruptly, but sub-THz usually means a range of 300 GHz down to 90, which is the upper end of FCC 5Gmmw.\\n\\nThe study Abstract uses two unquantified terms, \\u201csub-terahertz band\\u201d and \\u201csub-THz region.\\u201d I think \\u201cregion\\u201d is more accurate, meaning the range, or \\u201cspectrum\\u201d as understood in tech circles. \\u201cBand\\u201d is used to designate a single frequency, but also is an interval between a lower and upper frequency. For instance, a transmission between 40 and 50 MHz is a 10 MHz band (width).\\n\\nStudy frequencies were 75 GHz to 110 GHz. No wireless provider I\\u2019m aware of (in the US) has announced a mobile 5Gmmw service anywhere near 75 GHz. There was no explanation in the Abstract why announced commercial frequencies were not used.\\n\\nPower-level exposure limits at the user end are expressed in watts per area, usually square meter or square centimeter. No such levels are provided for the targets used, but maybe that\\u2019s not relevant in this case.\\n\\nThe highest commercial frequency I could find being tested is in the UK (though also approved for US), is 60 GHz. At least one rural test area is reportedly using a 60 GHz \\u201cwireless mesh\\u201d (interior network of interacting antennas) for \\u2018super WiFi.\\u2019 Not for mobile and still not up to 75 GHz.\\n\\nInteresting is that other UK rural testbeds are running unused TV bands called \\u201cTV white space\\u201d \\u2014 the old VHF to UHF frequencies, mostly MHz bands. This is 5G, mind you.\\n\\nHowever, bandwidths 71 to 76 GHz, 81 to 86 GHz and 92 to 95 GHz are available in the US for \\u201chigh-density\\u201d (high power) \\u201cfixed wireless access\\u201d services: \\u201c\\u2026the operation of wireless communication devices or systems used to connect two fixed locations (e.g., building to building or tower to building) with a radio or other wireless link\\u2026\\u201d, which would have to be line-of-sight and are not for mobile.\\n\\nAs noted, the higher the frequency, the greater are transmission challenges, so high-density bands would be very tight beams, with minimal to no obstacles and no human exposure (watch out, pigeons). Due to excess electricity consumption, MMW signals probably won\\u2019t be power boosted sufficiently to penetrate buildings, but be brought in via cable from an external receiver, then be distributed via a wireless network.\\n\\nStudy conclusion: \\u201cWe are raising a warning flag against the unrestricted use of sub-THz technologies for communication, before the possible consequences for public health are explored.\\u201d This seems sane enough \\u2013 within the insane context called wireless telecom/WiFi. See Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (needs updating).\\n\\nBut \\u201cunrestricted\\u201d at least suggests the impossible, that restrictions could prevent all trouble. Note also \\u201cpossible consequences.\\u201d This can\\u2019t be valid for harm in general, which is a fact long understood \\u2013 almost three decades before 2G came out (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\nWhen this warning is given, we don\\u2019t hear that the \\u201cwarning flag\\u201d would apply conceptually to all G\\u2019s; presumes there is a safe dose of MLB somewhere; and, as usual, neglects the ecosystem. But \\u2014 enough for protesters to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas? Making cases? I confess I fell for this one in my early research on wireless. A more likely, but still speculative, concern is discussed in Reports of \\u201c5G\\u201d Harm.\\n\\nAnother common warning, \\u201c5G is a weapon,\\u201d usually refers to the military\\u2019s Active Denial System, a \\u201cnon-lethal\\u201d microwave device for dispersing crowds by heating the skin. It\\u2019s a high density (power) millimeter wave at 95 GHz \\u2013 hardly commercial 5Gmmw.\\n\\nMMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G. Wireless telecom, beginning with 2G, is adapted stealth-weapon technology which uses very low power. The entire wireless system, not just \\u201c5G\\u201d, is a potential weapon on various levels (more below).\\n\\nAlso, high-enough density microwave \\u2014 at a \\u2018lowly\\u2019 2.5 GHz, for example \\u2014 will cook you like a microwave oven (2.45 GHz). That is, through and through, unlike ADS. At commercial power levels, 5Gmmw will not.\\n\\nA powerful Air Force radar system called Pave Paws at three US locations will cook you in a nanosecond at 420 to 450 MHz. Installations have two large circular arrays of antenna elements, each array radiating 580 kilowatts (!) It can detect a basketball at 12 miles, and small planes caught in the beam have blown up. So don\\u2019t swallow the rhetoric about telecom MMW weaponry.\\n\\nI was unable to find a range of ADS power output, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study calling out 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2) at 94 GHz (see Reports of Harm). ADS power is adjustable, however, enough to be used as a lethal weapon. But \\u2013 \\u2018making cases\\u2019 again?\\n\\nMicrowave ovens operate from 600 to 1200 watts. By comparison, maximum output of traditional cell towers is 10 watts \\u2013 phones, 2 watts. The higher frequency/shorter wavelength was chosen for ADS to limit penetration depth. Not saying that\\u2019s a good thing, not to mention it\\u2019s misleading (see Reports of Harm).\\n\\nFinding a wattage output figure for new, 5G MLB or MMW antennas proved fruitlessly time consuming (anyone?), but I did find a study establishing a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for a particular 5Gmmw antenna design for 28 and 38 GHz.\\n\\nSAR is an expression of how much radiation from a phone is absorbed over time by the body. It\\u2019s expressed in watts per kilogram (W/kg). Values were \\u201c\\u20260.37 and 1.34 W/kg [up to] 2 W/kg. Current FCC SAR standard is 1.6W/kg. This is given just for a sense of comparison, because SAR is useless for determining the amount of radiofrequency (RF) absorption in biosystems during typical conditions of use. See Safety Testing below.\\n\\nMany opposers suggest that 3G/4G/WiFi can be made reasonably safe. Others understand that impossibility, but seem too habituated and addicted to do the right thing. As noted in the Introduction, techno-humans are adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\n\\u201cNo \\u20185G\\u2019 safety studies have been conducted or funded by the Federal Communications Commission or the telecom industry, and none is planned.\\u201d Or simply, \\u201c5G has not been tested for safety\\u201d. Or the like. No such claims provide the facts.\\n\\nThat the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d terror, whereas, the real terror is wireless tech per se. Inherent in this ploy is the erroneous implication that 2G-4G were tested (a yes and no proposition).\\n\\nIn 1996, FCC adopted the standard identified as ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992. There were \\u2018window dressings\\u2019 in 2004, 2005, and 2010, and, like the original, covered frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019. (Overall \\u2018microwave\\u2019 is considered to be 300 MHz (.3 GHz) to 300 GHz.\\n\\nThe Commission\\u2019s assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is based on the fraudulent IEEE \\u2018testing\\u2019 it adopted in 1996 to run interference for 3G. That is, if the radiation doesn\\u2019t heat you, it can\\u2019t harm you.\\n\\nThis author warned of this response by FCC in February 2019 as \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria was powering up: Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised? Exposure limits worldwide are based on the ANSI/IEEE C95.1 fraud.\\n\\nPeer reviewed independent science, as early as the 1950s and still going, demonstrating myriad effects at non-heating levels, brings the integrity of C95.1-1992 through 2019 into question. Was *proper* testing ever done? Instead of clarifying this, hysteria makes the blanket claim. Making cases.\\n\\nThe FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science and such questions: \\u2018No convincing evidence exists, but we\\u2019re keeping an eye on it.\\u2019 The blatant criminality of the FCC with respect to wireless/EMF is clearly demonstrated by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nHysteria often resorts to another \\u2018ploy on words\\u2019 pertaining to 2G-4G, and used even by scientists, as seen near the end of this report: \\u201cThe current FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d The word implies that standards were at one time valid or sufficient, when they were never any such thing, for any living thing.\\n\\n\\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing has been demonstrated or can exist. Despite this, new limits are proposed and stubbornly called for \\u2014 in spite of the consensus that no safe level has even been published for fetuses.\\n\\nApparently, that\\u2019s not of sufficient concern to call for \\u201cStop Wireless Technology!\\u201d instead of \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d We\\u2019ll figure that fetus part out later.\\n\\nFor details on the original \\u2018safety\\u2019 testing \\u2013 scientific fraud, that is, on which power-level exposure limits worldwide are based \\u2013 see Sections Cell Phone Output and Exposure Limits for Users in the article Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\nMajor emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA,\\u2019 due to the short range and easy block-ability of MMW. But things seem to be developing differently for now, as we\\u2019ll see. As noted, even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\nThe following synthesis is the result of wading through too many articles to give credit to any one. Some sources tell varying stories about the same thing, and even disagree with each other considerably.\\n\\nSo here goes: A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard has been issued, specifying two frequency ranges: 5G NR bands FR1 & 5G NR bands FR2. Number one is for current bands below 6 GHz (5Gmlb), such as 600MHz, 1900MHz, and 2.5GHz; two is for MMW \\u2014 mostly 24 to 40 GHz for mobile, and higher for special applications (not mobile). In the near term, public WiFi will remain separate at MLB, 2.45 GHz and 5 GHz, but Verizon, for example, is offering 5Gmmw home internet/WiFi (not mobile) in limited areas of four cities.\\n\\n5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention at this point, including especially \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and \\u2018beamforming\\u2019 (more later).\\n\\nHowever, 5G NR FR1 can use the same towers as 4G, but will need new antennas. It has the same reach and penetration, but with shorter delay, while providing up to 35 percent more speed. The wireless addict\\u2019s dream. When you think about it, FR1 should really be 5G, and 5Gmmw, 6G.\\n\\nPlans are also in place for deployments using the unlicensed, Citizens Broadband Radio Service 3.5 GHz band, and all key players really want in. This is MLB called 5G, mind you.\\n\\nThings get a bit stickier when it comes to needing a new phone or not. Many current phones should be able to get updates to process FR1, but a new phone is needed for FR2. Generally, the \\u201ctech\\u201d advice is not to move yet, and here\\u2019s an example with Samsung\\u2019s $1300 5G Galaxy S10 being tested in Chicago (good shot of a 5Gmmw \\u201cnode\\u201d here).\\n\\nThe \\u201chold off\\u201d sentiment is conveyed also in this article. What it amounts to at this writing is that 5Gmmw is virtually at a \\u201cdemo\\u201d stage, not full coverage and service, even in town.\\n\\nMany \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers continue to use traditional 3G/4G/WiFi wireless, either knowing the danger or believing it\\u2019s safe, or will be, because they just want it. A possible motive driving hysteria?\\n\\nAnother possible motive for \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, or maybe just the effect it\\u2019s having, is to create a threat on the ground to draw resistance and to distract attention from the satellite program, a much more sinister development (see Examining Priorities below).\\n\\nThe disconnect about dangers brings up a story that drew wide attention at the time, especially in the UK, and one that seems to present a puzzle. It\\u2019s about the 6/26 2019 Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, Somerset County, England. It\\u2019s not strictly a \\u201crollout\\u201d story, more a system demo/test, but a decision was announced about installing \\u201c5G\\u201d network towers on festival grounds,\\n\\nDespite the fact that \\u201cGlastonbury officials [said] that move will allow festival attendees to access the Internet on their smartphones at faster speeds,\\u201d the announcement created a huge protest. In this story, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G are mentioned, but \\u201c5G\\u201d is not specified as MLB or MMW \\u2014 as anything, in other words. Is this hysteria-induced negligence?\\n\\nThe protest article is laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated one that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d. Even some much-admired professional associates/contacts promote this irresponsible notion. I must respectfully, but strongly, disagree, because the erroneous implication is that 2G-4G were/are not an experiment. Paradoxically, they were/are and were/are not experiments. Distinctions must be made (more below).\\n\\nConfusion again: \\u201cWhile obviously not many festival-goers are likely to have a \\u20185G\\u2019 phone by June, EE will be showing off what the network can do at its stand.\\u201d Once again, unspecified 5G. So, was the Glastonbury demo about 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb? Whatever, tickets sold out in less than 45 minutes.\\n\\nThe grand protest by potential attendees was both tragic and macabrely amusing: They were prepared to irradiate themselves constantly in huge numbers (up to 200,000 fans in attendance potentially using phones/smartphones), but fretted over \\u201c5G\\u201d, not even knowing it could have been their beloved 4G poison\\u2026reborn. Phone radiation is often overlooked.\\n\\nSimilarly, reports on the 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland clearly reflect the confusion and negligent use of \\u201c5G.\\u201d This Agence France-Presse story says, \\u201cBy early July, 334 antennae (sic) stations for 5G were operational across the country, authorities have told AFP.\\u201d Boy, watch out for authorities.\\n\\nAntenna location and density info aren\\u2019t revealed, but it could be urban or \\u2018near-urban.\\u2019 The number doesn\\u2019t seem to correspond to FLD in neighborhoods, but who knows, thanks to incomplete reporting (and perhaps misled authorities). The news reader is therefore in the dark about exactly what\\u2019s going on, but probably assumes it\\u2019s MMW. Due to\\u2026 \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s (but beginning much earlier). What was known then was later hushed in the runup to digital mobile telecom in 1991-2.\\n\\nThe decision was callously made long ago to put life/people at risk to have the technology (see History of Official Awareness below). Thus, the yes/no \\u201cexperiment\\u201d is not whether there will be harm from telecom/WiFi microwave, but the time window in which ongoing exposure damage \\u2014 across all frequencies and regardless of power level \\u2014 will manifest in a cascade of widespread intractable illness.\\n\\nNot to worry, though, that fate might be avoided: Ecosystem collapse could bring the house down beforehand. You might hear/see, \\u201cThe 5G race is on,\\u201d meaning market competition. The race of note, though, is between ecosystem collapse and human-health collapse.\\n\\nIn any case, here\\u2019s some of what\\u2019s happening in \\u2018real\\u2019 life. The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon. Carriers are choosing service areas for FR1, FR2 very carefully.\\n\\nT-Mobile has announced a nationwide 5Gmlb rollout at 600 MHz and an undisclosed application of \\u201c28 and 39\\u201d (see video), which means some 5Gmmw, almost certainly in cities.\\n\\nSprint\\u2019s plans are to run \\u201cLTE and 5G\\u201d simultaneously in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\nMentioned earlier, Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d (allegedly MMW \\u2013 5Gmmw) is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range to cover wide area\\u201d (5Gmlb), doesn\\u2019t say where.\\n\\nSacramento seems to be the most enthusiastic victim host for wireless. Here\\u2019s a gushing PR piece about a Verizon UWB installation at one Sacramento citizen\\u2019s home, with City officials attending. It features an external receiver. Sacramento also prides itself on opening the floodgates for \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more later).\\n\\nVerizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas, which could be its final destination. Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason. Ecocidal, terminally pathological 3G/4G still rages, again reflecting the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nThe forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. As noted earlier, drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for \\u201c18 million new\\u201d closely spaced fixtures nationwide. Given the above information on FR1 rollouts, there seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\nA report on new Qualcomm smartphone antennas supports the foregoing. It covers four bands between 26.5GHz and 40 GHz, but also antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 The QPM56xx RF module family works with the Snapdragon X50 modem to work in the sub-6GHz bands\\u2026\\u201d (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\nOne puzzle: It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) as specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs seem to disagree, saying 4G can handle IoT. Propaganda? Careless chatter? Who knows. It\\u2019s safe to assume, however, they refer to the new 4G/5Gmlb.\\n\\nSome opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. And the attempted widespread deployment of smart utility meters on 4G WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say. 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, because if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\nI didn\\u2019t bother spending the rest of my life trying to find if/where FLD installations are occurring. Anyone who\\u2019s seen close installations in any area, please share details in Comments.\\n\\nNow, if FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose. One, possibility of course, is optimized 5Gmlb performance, as in the past, although this shouldn\\u2019t often be necessary, due to the large cell and penetration of MLB.\\n\\nIn the entrained, FLD frame of mind, I was suspicious in Wireless Technology: \\u2026 (The 5G Locomotive section) of Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams\\u2019 statement in a 5/15/18 CNBC interview that antennas in your face is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019d say he was being coy, implying MLB, and being careful not to depict 5G accurately, since 5Gmmw must have increased FLD, while 5Gmlb, not for the most part.\\n\\nMcAdam touted 5Gmmw for smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality, all good reasons for planetary and health destruction. But remember, all the \\u201cSmart\\u201d out there now is WiFi, for which there is no 5Gmmw (although Verizon\\u2019s UWB Home Internet might qualify). \\u201cSmart\\u201d is the wireless tech word for monumentally stupid \\u2014 and for total surveillance and centralized coordination and control of daily life. See section The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026.\\n\\nNone of the above means things can\\u2019t change. It\\u2019s early. The MLB rollout could be just a prelude to an FLD/MMW invasion. If MMW gets a toe-hold and no one\\u2019s coming up provably sick, and people like it, it could weaken opposition and open floodgates.\\n\\nAnd there\\u2019s the question of how the many thousands of planned satellites (looking now like well more than 50,000) fit into the overall picture. Obviously, coverage comes immediately to mind, such as saturation in outlying areas? For IoT? One issue for satellites, though, is increased delay time (\\u201clatency\\u201d) due to distance. There could be a \\u2018division of labor\\u2019 among various services, such as ground for mobile and sats for entertainment.\\n\\nNote the promise of the nationwide sySTEMic programming to make kids into corporate plug-ins or hitech drones: \\u201cSTEM education emphasizes the value of a rigorous, interdisciplinary approach to education, allowing students to compete and succeed in a modern global marketplace.\\u201d How many dubious assumptions, claims and buzzwords in that PR flak?\\n\\nSTEM promises a wondrous, prosperous, techno-shiny future. It exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. In the developed world, the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum total of the latter. Speaking of which, once a city is immersed in \\u201csmart\\u201d tech, it\\u2019s likely to become a special target of hackers. Imagine the potential chaos.)\\n\\nThere have been various reports of adverse effects when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, almost certainly implying 5Gmmw. This would seem unlikely, virtually impossible, outside cities/populous areas.\\n\\nApparently, people see new infrastructure dense or not, or/and feel effects, and apparently assume MMW is in use, as we saw in the Bern example.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d harm stories consistently report symptoms existing before anyone even heard of 5G. Long before. All reported harms I\\u2019ve seen are classic 2G-4G symptoms, and mostly of the \\u2018Electrohypersensitivity\\u2019 type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\nRadiation/RF-level meters have been used to support claims. But RF meters don\\u2019t display frequencies, only power level within a range of frequencies. Ordinary meters, costing from around $120 to $400, top out at 8 GHz. 3G/4G mobile frequencies range from 600 megahertz to 2.5 GHz in the US, with 3.5 GHz coming. WiFi is 2.4 and 5 GHz. Recall, FCC defines 5Gmmw as 24 GHz to 90 GHz. Thus, current meters can\\u2019t read MMW.\\n\\nA true 5G phone would identify MMW (and MLB at this point). Professional (very expensive) meters cover low and high ranges into the upper GHz (I found one 10 MHz to 220 GHz), but also don\\u2019t display frequencies, so all frequencies present still couldn\\u2019t be identified.\\n\\nLong-term exposure, perhaps a cumulative effect, is playing into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Thus, if there is harm when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, what\\u2019s shown by existing meters? Not understood by victims and reporters? 4G, one way or another. Hysteria-induced confusion.\\n\\nOne hawker claims its meter can read \\u201c5G\\u201d based on the fact that two new MLB frequencies are used for 5G (mlb). Any old meter does this. This ruse brought to you by \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nMeters are interesting, but not really helpful for most people. Radiation is everywhere; no amount of exposure is safe; most bio-effects below heating are power-independent; and effects may be cumulative (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nA meter might come in handy for someone with outward symptoms and using some form of shielding, for example. It could be seen at what level symptoms abate \\u2013 which doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops. Most likely, it\\u2019s palliation, but it can still save much grief and help people function.\\n\\nWe can come to cautious conclusion about the frequency present by type of effect. Known effects of MMW (a limited volume of science, though growing) differ from MLB effects long reported in the voluminous dismissed science.\\n\\nMMW potentially threatens skin and eyes, but more effects are being reported, although sometimes \\u2018stretched.\\u2019 For example, a paper cited (in an article by a prominent scientist who must remain anonymous) to show that 5Gmmw impacts \\u201cheart rate variability\\u201d was a military directed-energy study (see Author Information) using 94 GHz at 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2). That\\u2019s essentially the \\u201cADS\\u201d system noted earlier.\\n\\nNot only is 75 mW 75 times the main FCC limit (limits vary with frequency), but 94 is a frequency higher than the upper limit of 5Gmmw defined by the FCC, and certainly wouldn\\u2019t be used in mobile applications. Making cases?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not that MMW can\\u2019t create MLB effects, but it\\u2019s a bit speculative at this point. It\\u2019s possible, however \\u201c\\u2026since nerves, blood vessels and other electrically conducting structures can carry radiation-induced currents deep into the body\\u201d (see section 5G is qualitatively and quantitatively different from 4G)\\n\\nAntenna technology called MIMO (pron. my-mo) has been around for about a decade now for MLB. The more recent development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, meaning many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming (and receiving) beams of radiation. It looks to be destined for both FR1 and FR2 (a virtual necessity for MMW). As noted, Sprint will use this at for 5G at 3.5 GHz.\\n\\nOne question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose an additional threat. It\\u2019s possible they have an effect different from traditional antennas. Also, it seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of many focused beams, although being immersed in a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\nIn any case, aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying a beam from point to point (line of sight) avoids high power output per beam, since penetration of intervening structures isn\\u2019t required.\\n\\nHysteria often warns of outrageously high power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d As noted, effects occur at all levels below heating, which is why 3G/4G need to go. And it would not behoove the industry for people to suddenly be suffering heat damage.\\n\\nDetails of several typical news reports follow. Most demonstrate the fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one shows a more general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\nThe story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from a Verizon antenna installed near the home illustrates confusion. The first video on this page shows testimony before the Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with the mayor present.\\n\\nThe type of antenna isn\\u2019t given. But it\\u2019s probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. We learned from the \\u201cgushing PR piece\\u201d cited in the 5G Rollouts section that Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strange that the testimony date precedes the stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests prior to the grand \\u201cunveiling,\\u201d so it could have been an early \\u201cHome\\u201d antenna. Or maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\nThe opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that ambiguous statement mean to the person who wrote it? To the viewer? The incident suggests harm (cold/flu symptoms) from 5Gmmw but still reinforces the importance of knowing what we mean when we say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\nThe mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although her prepared speech commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but the suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness, even though levels \\u201care still very high\\u201d will certainly be taken officially as \\u201ccorrelation,\\u201d not proof or even evidence.\\n\\nTypically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\nBottom line: Which 5G is present is academic, since the pre-\\u201c5G\\u201d endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal. Focus on \\u201c5G\\u201d is like fretting about a wildfire 10 miles away while your house is burning down.\\n\\nOne of the more outrageous opposition-induced hysterias in recent times is a story from Gateshead, a town in northern UK near the North Sea, that new LED street lights (no microwave fixtures on them, just the lights) were emitting \\u201c5G\\u201d and causing health issues. This was carelessly picked up by other outlets. No one gave a moment\\u2019s thought to the likelihood that it might be LED lights themselves.\\n\\nA news report from Cincinnati clearly demonstrates that folks are in the dark about what 5G is, thanks to hysteria. And a fairly well-known one from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, to its credit, shows a better general awareness of wireless threat. But both demonstrate questionable thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make them safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem).\\n\\nScroll down this page to see an RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story. Regardless of one\\u2019s opinion of RT, this one\\u2019s a great and accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\nThe original story from 9/20/19 (now includes an update) is a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria,\\u201d since no one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers up to this point. It involves a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that \\u201cpeople fear\\u201d will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d.\\n\\nThe 9/27/19 update shows a video interview with a concerned nurse, a conditioned \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacking understanding of the wireless threat. She\\u2019ll feel safer if that nasty tall tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\nThe tall, new-look tower with the cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video) is clearly not the massive MIMO 5Gmmw/small-cell type shown in the 5G-phone report in the 5G Rollouts section. That was Verizon\\u2019s.\\n\\nThe update also says the tower is Sprint\\u2019s. As noted, Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using massive MIMO. It being a Sprint tower, it\\u2019s not MMW. The \\u201c5G\\u201d fear was an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\nSo what\\u2019s in the cylindrical fixture? Could be 4G (LTE), 5Gmlb (\\u201c5G\\u201d), WiFi as well? WiMax? One question \\u2013 is it MIMO? Massive? Anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\nThe update notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are also popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman David Weissmann confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what? From what we\\u2019ve seen of Verizon, probably 5Gmlb, i.e., 4G LTE on FR1 steroids.\\n\\nThe San Joaquin report, from 3/12/19 also concerns a tall tower with a cylindrical fixture. But this isn\\u2019t about 5G, but about \\u201ca cell tower\\u201d being too close to an elementary school in Ripon with a \\u2018cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\n\\u201cAll in all, three teachers and four students have been battling various cancers since 2016,\\u201d as well as a 22-year-old former male student. Of course, those teachers and that young man \\u2018never\\u2019 used a wireless device, and never near that tower. Nor were they exposed to another tower or anyone else\\u2019s phone. This doesn\\u2019t seem to dawn on people.\\n\\nThe Ripon case is interesting. An independent expert was consulted, who contradicted official assurance that the tower tested within federal standards. He said he wouldn\\u2019t send his kids there, because kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed \\u2013 as if they\\u2019re not exposed 24/7 anywhere a phone/tower system is working, not only from towers, but many phones as well. And does he think that once you\\u2019re \\u201cdeveloped\\u201d it\\u2019s OK?\\n\\nSprint subsequently shut it down and agreed to relocate, guilty or not. The move was good PR, and indicates that companies and municipalities will back down \\u2013 probably to avoid litigation, since that could open floodgates.\\n\\nRipon is important for two more reasons. The first is the usually overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure (see History of Official Awareness below). It\\u2019s well known, for example, that effects from cigarette tobacco and ionizing radiation (like a hospital X-ray), are cumulative. There\\u2019s no reason wireless radiation should be any different.\\n\\nMost kids are heavily exposed in our wireless world, wherever they are \\u2013 many from conception, and even before that, especially to ovarian DNA damage. This is one egregious crime of the technology.\\n\\nThe second reason is the bogus advice that \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the false argument for slow death over quicker death, or the futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can even make things worse. The farther the source, the greater are reflection and refraction of signals, creating a far more chaotic condition for the body to handle. Any telecom/WiFi antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\nReducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usually usage tips but also lower exposure limits. Despite calls for the latter, it holds mostly for heating. For non-heating effects, lower power could even increase the threat, since there\\u2019s a good chance that the closer we get to the minute power levels used by biosystems for intercellular communication, a greater confusion sets in.\\n\\nWith regard to usage tips, \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures accumulate over time to engender serious disease \\u2013 of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem, whose damage these clever warnings for humans worsen.\\n\\nThe problem is that reliance on power level alone to determine safety is largely a convenience (there\\u2019s that fatal word again), not science. The reader doesn\\u2019t need to understand the following terms, just that there are several factors in play, including whether the signal is continuous or pulsed, the shape of the pulsations, the rise time, fall time and duration of the pulsations, the type and depth of modulation, the frequencies, and the bandwidth.\\n\\nTry to set a \\u201csafe\\u201d exposure limit based on all that. So they keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\nA corollary is that folks claiming harm seem to think it\\u2019s for the first time. This is fatal error. There are also stories wherein people or animals affected by, say, a Smart meter, regard symptom abatement when the meter is removed as complete recovery. More fatal error. People have no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway. By now, the reader should know why.\\n\\nAn Idaho organization, ehsidaho.com, collects reports on the incidence and effects of what\\u2019s being called electrohypersensitivity, or EHS. The term is misleading, because no living thing is unaffected by the radiation, whether it manifests outwardly or not. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 is suggested.\\n\\nAn estimated 35% of the population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\nClaire Edwards, a former UN staffer, top writer and wireless activist said to me in an email that an estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. The rest of society is virtually thumbing its nose at these unfortunate people. But they\\u2019ll also suffer if this red flag is ignored: As bad as this sensitivity is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad, either in incidence or severity, as things could quickly and easily get.\\n\\nIllness caused by wireless radiation is not new or unique to it, even though there are lists and categories of issues attributed to it. In medicine, a symptom can be caused by any number of influences, and a single influence can cause various symptoms.\\n\\nSo a big question is, how much of today\\u2019s ongoing ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 that is, defined and named prior to the wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to telecom/WiFi radiation (or even the whole radiation gamut to which we expose ourselves)?\\n\\nIf officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\nThus even for EMF-sick users \\u2014 who are much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors (oblivious) attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\nBut quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 is what must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\nManifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere (see The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026).\\n\\nIf we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\nOf the several historical documents acknowledging the deleterious effects of artificial electromagnetic fields denied by FCC, the definitive one for wireless tech seems to be a 1981 World Health Organization (WHO) report entitled Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973. (I\\u2019ve always thought it unfortunate and instructive that \\u201cenvironmental health\\u201d is not about techno-human torment of Earth, but concern about just payback for the tormentor).\\n\\nThe report is long, covering many aspects. It covers all telecom/WiFi frequencies, including MMW; but real-world harm for the last three decades has come, and continues from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\nAs forthright as the WHO publication purports to be, the Summary reveals a distressing ruthlessness. It\\u2019s all most people need to read to understand that \\u2018they\\u2019 knew. For reader convenience, a brief review follows.\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.3 Biological effects in experimental animals: It has been demonstrated that low-level, long-term exposure may induce effects in the nervous, haematopoietic (production of blood cells and platelets), and immuno-competent cell systems of animals. Such effects have been reported in small animals (rodents) exposed to incident power density levels as low as 0.1-1.0 mW/cm2\\u201d (\\u201cmW\\u201d = milliwatt \\u2013 one thousandth of a watt). So this is one tenth of one thousandth of a watt to one thousandth of a watt per square centimeter. FCC limit: one thousandth of a watt \\u2013 1 mW/cm2 (for frequencies 1500 MHz \\u2013 100 GHz).\\n\\n\\u201cThe reported effects on the nervous system include behavioural, bioelectrical, metabolic, and structural (at the cellular and subcellular levels) changes. Erythrocyte production and haemaglobin synthesis may be impaired and immunological reactivity changed.\\u201d OK so far (except for exploiting/hurting animals).\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.6: Health risk evaluation as a basis for exposure limits: \\u2026 A highly conservative approach would be to keep exposure limits close to natural background levels. However, this is not technically feasible [emphasis added]. A reasonable risk-benefit analysis has to be considered.\\u201d\\n\\nIs \\u201chighly conservative\\u201d a euphemism for \\u201csafe\\u201d? And what does \\u201cclose\\u201d mean? In any case, the \\u201cbackground level,\\u201c called the cosmic background is 0.0000000001 \\u2013 0.000000000000001 \\u00b5W/cm2 (\\u00b5W = microwatt \\u2013 one millionth of a watt). Thus, the higher background limit (first one) is one ten billionth of a millionth of a watt (sounds like just a few electrons to me \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nFCC limit is on the other side of the decimal point at 1000 \\u00b5W/cm2. a thousand millionths of a watt \\u2013 per square centimeter, that is. Frankly, the author\\u2019s head goes into a spin with these minuscule decimals, but it\\u2019s safe to say there\\u2019s a bit of a margin between FCC and Cosmos \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nThe FCC limit is outrageous even compared to the most conservative proposed \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit: .003 \\u2013 .006 \\u00b5W/cm2. and the BioInitiative Report authors say it might even need to be lower..\\n\\nImportantly, however, the cosmic variety is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed). That means there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limit after all: zero.\\n\\n\\u201cNot technically feasible\\u201d? Well, of course. Technology is more important than health in some minds. \\u201cReasonable risk-benefit\\u201d? The Summary doesn\\u2019t say how many sick or dead per million is reasonable. (Please see also)\\n\\nOne wonders if they were aware of earlier studies, referred to by Andrew Michrowski, PhD at the 2009 Toronto Whole Life Expo (see section, Key Testimony in Toronto in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMichrowski interprets the data for us: \\u201cAnalysis of 1950 -1974 mortality of 40,000 Korean War veterans shows that microwave exposure effect is cumulative [emphasis added] it affects all deaths \\u2026 doubling to tripling cancers of eye, brain and central nervous system, lymphatic and hematopoietic [blood-cell/platelet-forming] and digestive systems. This means that even \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures from wireless systems accumulate over the years and decades to engender serious diseases\\u201d (can\\u2019t be said too often).\\n\\nNor do we know if the Warsaw International Symposium or its WHO reviewers were aware that the US military and others conducted microwave stealth-weapon research in the 1950s. This technology became 2G. See Sections Assault: From Weapon to Telecom and Ultimate Atrocity in the Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nOpposition warnings frequently emphasize \\u2018protecting you and your family.\\u2019 The point having been made several times is worth repeating: The most dire threat is to the ecosystem, not humans. No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\nEnvironment usually suffers in the background of hysteria. One will see lists something like this: \\u201chealth, privacy, security, and the environment.\\u201d\\n\\nThose who offer exposure \\u201csolutions\\u201d or \\u201ctips\\u201d seem to forget that no form or amount of human protection does so for Nature. A false sense of security in being \\u201csafer\\u201d leads to continued use and support of the overall system, immeasurably intensifying that threat.\\n\\nInsects, for example, are highly susceptible to telecom/WiFi microwave, especially to MMW, which we haven\\u2019t even had yet. In the last quarter century or so, coinciding closely with the introduction of 2G, 75% of the biomass of insects has disappeared in otherwise protected areas in Germany. Meaning it\\u2019s probably worse where other threats co-exist.\\n\\nEmphatically: The wireless threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. We need to look at the context of wireless, which is technology, per se. And one thing is certain about most of that, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\nIn almost all cases, somewhere along the line from resource acquisition (especially mining) to manufacture, use, and disposal, advanced technology is chemically/energetically toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless encompasses the entire line of a process of Earth liquidation/sacrifice for human \\u201cneeds\\u201d \\u2013 money, convenience, and entertainment (see section The Price of Techno-Civilization in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMoving to \\u201cwired\\u201d telecom/WiFi will not stop this assault. Countries are under siege for resources. Nor will the Elite psyops \\u201cSustainable Development\\u201d and \\u201cClean Renewable Energy\\u201d stop it. But that\\u2019s another article.\\n\\nThe attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed. I ask that anyone who can name a major environmental or health crisis in which technology isn\\u2019t the cause or doesn\\u2019t play a major role, comment about it.\\n\\nLooking at the overall output of \\u201cconcerned\\u201d EMF scientists and activists, however, if one isn\\u2019t careful, one could conclude it\\u2019s thought that humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\nAnother major concern is disproportionate attention on local antennas, while a massive satellite program proceeds. At one point, up to 20,000 satellites were planned to blanket the globe. But the number keeps growing.\\n\\nMadman Elon Musk\\u2019s SpaceX had dibs on 12,000 for 5Gmmw. Here is news that Madman is applying for 30,000 more. Just 42,000 satellites will be about 5 times the total spacecraft launched since 1957 (8,500).\\n\\nSeveral other companies, including Boeing, OneWeb, Amazon, Facebook, not to mention Russia and China, mean many thousands more. Total madness could bring it to somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000. This considered sane. Why? Because insanity unrecognized as such has become the norm in the culture of toxic-technomasturbation.\\n\\nPollution. Some 150 tons of refined kerosene and 340 tons of liquid oxygen per Musk 5G launch (60 satellites, 400 kg each). Do the math, even for 12,000. There seems to be no concern for consequences, such as potential damage to the ozone layer, major interference with earth\\u2019s energy field, or even increased atmospheric CO2 (for the faithful). Not to mention, decline of breathable free oxygen (very cool dynamic graph).\\n\\nMuch seems to be up in the air on the satellite program. Since launches proceed in haste, the plan seems to be shoot them up first, answer proprietary questions later, dismissing anyone else\\u2019s. In Europe, there are currently calls for papers on satellite integration with 5G, with submissions deadline being the Ides of March 2020.\\n\\nNASA, NOAA, meteorologists, (and radio astronomers) have issued valid concerns about MMW. FCC has dismissed them, too. Yet, NASA intends to participate in this bit of insanity.\\n\\nMight such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates? Insane is a good word for it, but psychopathic puts a more specific tag on it. See subsections Same Old Story\\u2026 and \\u2026with a Twist in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nThe best way to beat 5G, on the ground at least, is to quit wireless tech flat. Little demand \\u2018down here\\u2019 could greatly reduce incentive to invest \\u2018up there\\u2019. If there is a total-surveillance and human-control system gestating in the technosphere, how much of a role could satellites play?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strongly suggested that an outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the one on earthbound antennas.\\n\\nTaking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\nAgain, a race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse. Allowing classic 4G (or even just 5G FR1) to continue potentiates imminent disaster. Both scenarios are in progress, but at the \\u2018deniable\\u2019 stage. When \\u2018undeniable\\u2019 sets in, the slope will almost certainly have become too steep and slippery.\\n\\nExperience shows that science-based appeals, to governments at all levels; to national and international regulatory bodies, and so on is an exercise in futility due to multiple factors, including corruption, disbelief, and intimidation. Old and chronic conditions.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s in the People\\u2019s hands now, at the commercial level. Either common sense prevails over addiction and selfishness, or we wait for the race to end and hope it\\u2019s not too late.\\n\\nGive up wireless per se or give up the future \\u2013 liberty first, then life. If not, then welcome all 5G, especially the satellites. Surrender to it will mercifully shorten the coming agony.\\n\\nPeter Tocci is a retired massage therapist and wellness consultant with an abiding interest in exploring \\u2018managed\\u2019 history, nefarious covert agendas, and mainstream/mainstream-alternative news-media dereliction, distortion and suppression.

Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more like hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts.

A Bullet Summary for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose detail, and a Text Summary, for those who want a more general sweep. Both provide means for quickly accessing areas of particular interest. But reading the full text is strongly encouraged. A small number of revisions might not appear in the Summaries.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\nWithout any help from \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers, the \\u201cnext generation\\u201d wireless is very dangerous \\u2014 all by itself \\u2014 as is each previous G by itself. But due to hysteria (illogic, inaccuracies and omissions), most opposition is also dangerous by itself.\\n\\nNot much has changed since this PC Mag article was published in 1/2019. And that doesn\\u2019t cover all critical aspects.\\n\\nConfusion begins right off the bat with the term \\u201c5G.\\u201d It\\u2019s being flung carelessly about, in articles, protests, news reports, corporate bulletins, by politicians \\u2013 even by scientists, and in submissions and comments to official bodies.\\n\\nAlmost always implied when \\u201c5G\\u201d is uttered \\u2013 especially, \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d or \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d \\u2013 is use of the \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This causes misunderstanding and potential danger.\\n\\nOverall, EHF is specified as 30 GHz to 300 GHz, and wavelength 10 millimeters to 1mm respectively. Only a small portion of that range is used in high-frequency 5G operation, and is defined in the US by the FCC as 24 GHz to 90 GHz.\\n\\nAs explained below in 5G Rollouts, for accuracy one must at least distinguish between 1) \\u2018small-cell\\u2019 infrastructure and 5G/small cells per se; 2) between 5G infrastructure and 5G high-frequency radiation; 3) between antennas and their enclosures, and **4) between high frequency 5G and mid-/low-band 5G, the signaling long used for 2G-4G iterations.\\n\\nNew terms are offered here for consistency and for clarifying hysteria-induced misunderstanding and confusion: \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d is a housing for antennas (sending/receiving elements). A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\nOne might see warnings such as: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSmall cell\\u201d is regularly misused, even by the Industry. Accurately speaking, a cell is not an antenna, but the effective area/range of an antenna\\u2019s radiation. 5Gmmw has a short range, which decreases with higher frequency. Thus, its cell is comparatively small.\\n\\nAlso, MMW can easily be blocked, even by even leaves and heavy rain, which deficiency increases with increasing frequency. Both drawbacks can be improved with a substantial power boost, but this also becomes a problem with energy cost and exposure levels, and so is not under consideration. Energy consumption is a major concern for the industry, which is feverishly at work to solve it.\\n\\nShort range and easy \\u2018blockability\\u2019 require more fixture locations, which hysteria frets about, rarely noting the distinction that 5Gmlb makes a large cell and is not blocked. Call it nitpicking if you will, but why not be accurate instead of creating misconception or \\u2018making cases\\u2019?\\n\\n\\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density, and common hysteria about how it will be implemented are in serious question (more later).\\n\\nOne interesting discovery came up while working on this article: Small cells are small but not new, and were not developed for 5G. Small cells have long been deployed in 3G and 4G networks and have become an industry choice to deliver MMW and enable better MLB performance if needed.\\n\\nTraditionally, there have been three types of small cells (more now), identified as they should be by antenna range. Some early deployments were in the US in 2007 and in the UK and Europe in 2009. \\u201cAccording to Small Cell Forum (who would have thought?), 18 million small cells had been deployed globally for various applications by the end of 2016.\\u201d\\n\\nBut haven\\u2019t we been led in a virtually deliberate way from the outset, and even continue to be, to think that 5G is small cells/MMW? Saying \\u201c5G\\u201d to indicate only these two things, or not specifying what you mean, is irresponsible, inaccurate, and misleading, as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nA 10/8/19 bulletin from Project Censored was forwarded to me via an email group that received it from Joel M. Moskowitz, PhD, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at UC Berkeley. A typically careless statement consisting of an error and a question mark says, \\u201cThe telecom industry is promoting the replacement of the current cellular network, known as 4G, with a new generation of higher frequency 5G wavelengths to power the \\u201cInternet of Things\\u2026\\u201d As a generalization, this is either shameful unawareness of the current scenario or untruth/propaganda, as we\\u2019ll also see.\\n\\n5G opposition also asserts that the skin\\u2019s (spiral) sweat ducts act as \\u201creceiving antennas.\\u201d This refers to an Israeli study, \\u201cThe human skin as a sub-THz receiver \\u2013 Does 5G pose a danger to it or not?\\u201d\\n\\nFrequency ranges don\\u2019t transition abruptly, but sub-THz usually means a range of 300 GHz down to 90, which is the upper end of FCC 5Gmmw.\\n\\nThe study Abstract uses two unquantified terms, \\u201csub-terahertz band\\u201d and \\u201csub-THz region.\\u201d I think \\u201cregion\\u201d is more accurate, meaning the range, or \\u201cspectrum\\u201d as understood in tech circles. \\u201cBand\\u201d is used to designate a single frequency, but also is an interval between a lower and upper frequency. For instance, a transmission between 40 and 50 MHz is a 10 MHz band (width).\\n\\nStudy frequencies were 75 GHz to 110 GHz. No wireless provider I\\u2019m aware of (in the US) has announced a mobile 5Gmmw service anywhere near 75 GHz. There was no explanation in the Abstract why announced commercial frequencies were not used.\\n\\nPower-level exposure limits at the user end are expressed in watts per area, usually square meter or square centimeter. No such levels are provided for the targets used, but maybe that\\u2019s not relevant in this case.\\n\\nThe highest commercial frequency I could find being tested is in the UK (though also approved for US), is 60 GHz. At least one rural test area is reportedly using a 60 GHz \\u201cwireless mesh\\u201d (interior network of interacting antennas) for \\u2018super WiFi.\\u2019 Not for mobile and still not up to 75 GHz.\\n\\nInteresting is that other UK rural testbeds are running unused TV bands called \\u201cTV white space\\u201d \\u2014 the old VHF to UHF frequencies, mostly MHz bands. This is 5G, mind you.\\n\\nHowever, bandwidths 71 to 76 GHz, 81 to 86 GHz and 92 to 95 GHz are available in the US for \\u201chigh-density\\u201d (high power) \\u201cfixed wireless access\\u201d services: \\u201c\\u2026the operation of wireless communication devices or systems used to connect two fixed locations (e.g., building to building or tower to building) with a radio or other wireless link\\u2026\\u201d, which would have to be line-of-sight and are not for mobile.\\n\\nAs noted, the higher the frequency, the greater are transmission challenges, so high-density bands would be very tight beams, with minimal to no obstacles and no human exposure (watch out, pigeons). Due to excess electricity consumption, MMW signals probably won\\u2019t be power boosted sufficiently to penetrate buildings, but be brought in via cable from an external receiver, then be distributed via a wireless network.\\n\\nStudy conclusion: \\u201cWe are raising a warning flag against the unrestricted use of sub-THz technologies for communication, before the possible consequences for public health are explored.\\u201d This seems sane enough \\u2013 within the insane context called wireless telecom/WiFi. See Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (needs updating).\\n\\nBut \\u201cunrestricted\\u201d at least suggests the impossible, that restrictions could prevent all trouble. Note also \\u201cpossible consequences.\\u201d This can\\u2019t be valid for harm in general, which is a fact long understood \\u2013 almost three decades before 2G came out (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\nWhen this warning is given, we don\\u2019t hear that the \\u201cwarning flag\\u201d would apply conceptually to all G\\u2019s; presumes there is a safe dose of MLB somewhere; and, as usual, neglects the ecosystem. But \\u2014 enough for protesters to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas? Making cases? I confess I fell for this one in my early research on wireless. A more likely, but still speculative, concern is discussed in Reports of \\u201c5G\\u201d Harm.\\n\\nAnother common warning, \\u201c5G is a weapon,\\u201d usually refers to the military\\u2019s Active Denial System, a \\u201cnon-lethal\\u201d microwave device for dispersing crowds by heating the skin. It\\u2019s a high density (power) millimeter wave at 95 GHz \\u2013 hardly commercial 5Gmmw.\\n\\nMMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G. Wireless telecom, beginning with 2G, is adapted stealth-weapon technology which uses very low power. The entire wireless system, not just \\u201c5G\\u201d, is a potential weapon on various levels (more below).\\n\\nAlso, high-enough density microwave \\u2014 at a \\u2018lowly\\u2019 2.5 GHz, for example \\u2014 will cook you like a microwave oven (2.45 GHz). That is, through and through, unlike ADS. At commercial power levels, 5Gmmw will not.\\n\\nA powerful Air Force radar system called Pave Paws at three US locations will cook you in a nanosecond at 420 to 450 MHz. Installations have two large circular arrays of antenna elements, each array radiating 580 kilowatts (!) It can detect a basketball at 12 miles, and small planes caught in the beam have blown up. So don\\u2019t swallow the rhetoric about telecom MMW weaponry.\\n\\nI was unable to find a range of ADS power output, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study calling out 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2) at 94 GHz (see Reports of Harm). ADS power is adjustable, however, enough to be used as a lethal weapon. But \\u2013 \\u2018making cases\\u2019 again?\\n\\nMicrowave ovens operate from 600 to 1200 watts. By comparison, maximum output of traditional cell towers is 10 watts \\u2013 phones, 2 watts. The higher frequency/shorter wavelength was chosen for ADS to limit penetration depth. Not saying that\\u2019s a good thing, not to mention it\\u2019s misleading (see Reports of Harm).\\n\\nFinding a wattage output figure for new, 5G MLB or MMW antennas proved fruitlessly time consuming (anyone?), but I did find a study establishing a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for a particular 5Gmmw antenna design for 28 and 38 GHz.\\n\\nSAR is an expression of how much radiation from a phone is absorbed over time by the body. It\\u2019s expressed in watts per kilogram (W/kg). Values were \\u201c\\u20260.37 and 1.34 W/kg [up to] 2 W/kg. Current FCC SAR standard is 1.6W/kg. This is given just for a sense of comparison, because SAR is useless for determining the amount of radiofrequency (RF) absorption in biosystems during typical conditions of use. See Safety Testing below.\\n\\nMany opposers suggest that 3G/4G/WiFi can be made reasonably safe. Others understand that impossibility, but seem too habituated and addicted to do the right thing. As noted in the Introduction, techno-humans are adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\n\\u201cNo \\u20185G\\u2019 safety studies have been conducted or funded by the Federal Communications Commission or the telecom industry, and none is planned.\\u201d Or simply, \\u201c5G has not been tested for safety\\u201d. Or the like. No such claims provide the facts.\\n\\nThat the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d terror, whereas, the real terror is wireless tech per se. Inherent in this ploy is the erroneous implication that 2G-4G were tested (a yes and no proposition).\\n\\nIn 1996, FCC adopted the standard identified as ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992. There were \\u2018window dressings\\u2019 in 2004, 2005, and 2010, and, like the original, covered frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019. (Overall \\u2018microwave\\u2019 is considered to be 300 MHz (.3 GHz) to 300 GHz.\\n\\nThe Commission\\u2019s assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is based on the fraudulent IEEE \\u2018testing\\u2019 it adopted in 1996 to run interference for 3G. That is, if the radiation doesn\\u2019t heat you, it can\\u2019t harm you.\\n\\nThis author warned of this response by FCC in February 2019 as \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria was powering up: Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised? Exposure limits worldwide are based on the ANSI/IEEE C95.1 fraud.\\n\\nPeer reviewed independent science, as early as the 1950s and still going, demonstrating myriad effects at non-heating levels, brings the integrity of C95.1-1992 through 2019 into question. Was *proper* testing ever done? Instead of clarifying this, hysteria makes the blanket claim. Making cases.\\n\\nThe FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science and such questions: \\u2018No convincing evidence exists, but we\\u2019re keeping an eye on it.\\u2019 The blatant criminality of the FCC with respect to wireless/EMF is clearly demonstrated by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nHysteria often resorts to another \\u2018ploy on words\\u2019 pertaining to 2G-4G, and used even by scientists, as seen near the end of this report: \\u201cThe current FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d The word implies that standards were at one time valid or sufficient, when they were never any such thing, for any living thing.\\n\\n\\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing has been demonstrated or can exist. Despite this, new limits are proposed and stubbornly called for \\u2014 in spite of the consensus that no safe level has even been published for fetuses.\\n\\nApparently, that\\u2019s not of sufficient concern to call for \\u201cStop Wireless Technology!\\u201d instead of \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d We\\u2019ll figure that fetus part out later.\\n\\nFor details on the original \\u2018safety\\u2019 testing \\u2013 scientific fraud, that is, on which power-level exposure limits worldwide are based \\u2013 see Sections Cell Phone Output and Exposure Limits for Users in the article Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\nMajor emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA,\\u2019 due to the short range and easy block-ability of MMW. But things seem to be developing differently for now, as we\\u2019ll see. As noted, even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\nThe following synthesis is the result of wading through too many articles to give credit to any one. Some sources tell varying stories about the same thing, and even disagree with each other considerably.\\n\\nSo here goes: A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard has been issued, specifying two frequency ranges: 5G NR bands FR1 & 5G NR bands FR2. Number one is for current bands below 6 GHz (5Gmlb), such as 600MHz, 1900MHz, and 2.5GHz; two is for MMW \\u2014 mostly 24 to 40 GHz for mobile, and higher for special applications (not mobile). In the near term, public WiFi will remain separate at MLB, 2.45 GHz and 5 GHz, but Verizon, for example, is offering 5Gmmw home internet/WiFi (not mobile) in limited areas of four cities.\\n\\n5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention at this point, including especially \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and \\u2018beamforming\\u2019 (more later).\\n\\nHowever, 5G NR FR1 can use the same towers as 4G, but will need new antennas. It has the same reach and penetration, but with shorter delay, while providing up to 35 percent more speed. The wireless addict\\u2019s dream. When you think about it, FR1 should really be 5G, and 5Gmmw, 6G.\\n\\nPlans are also in place for deployments using the unlicensed, Citizens Broadband Radio Service 3.5 GHz band, and all key players really want in. This is MLB called 5G, mind you.\\n\\nThings get a bit stickier when it comes to needing a new phone or not. Many current phones should be able to get updates to process FR1, but a new phone is needed for FR2. Generally, the \\u201ctech\\u201d advice is not to move yet, and here\\u2019s an example with Samsung\\u2019s $1300 5G Galaxy S10 being tested in Chicago (good shot of a 5Gmmw \\u201cnode\\u201d here).\\n\\nThe \\u201chold off\\u201d sentiment is conveyed also in this article. What it amounts to at this writing is that 5Gmmw is virtually at a \\u201cdemo\\u201d stage, not full coverage and service, even in town.\\n\\nMany \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers continue to use traditional 3G/4G/WiFi wireless, either knowing the danger or believing it\\u2019s safe, or will be, because they just want it. A possible motive driving hysteria?\\n\\nAnother possible motive for \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, or maybe just the effect it\\u2019s having, is to create a threat on the ground to draw resistance and to distract attention from the satellite program, a much more sinister development (see Examining Priorities below).\\n\\nThe disconnect about dangers brings up a story that drew wide attention at the time, especially in the UK, and one that seems to present a puzzle. It\\u2019s about the 6/26 2019 Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, Somerset County, England. It\\u2019s not strictly a \\u201crollout\\u201d story, more a system demo/test, but a decision was announced about installing \\u201c5G\\u201d network towers on festival grounds,\\n\\nDespite the fact that \\u201cGlastonbury officials [said] that move will allow festival attendees to access the Internet on their smartphones at faster speeds,\\u201d the announcement created a huge protest. In this story, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G are mentioned, but \\u201c5G\\u201d is not specified as MLB or MMW \\u2014 as anything, in other words. Is this hysteria-induced negligence?\\n\\nThe protest article is laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated one that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d. Even some much-admired professional associates/contacts promote this irresponsible notion. I must respectfully, but strongly, disagree, because the erroneous implication is that 2G-4G were/are not an experiment. Paradoxically, they were/are and were/are not experiments. Distinctions must be made (more below).\\n\\nConfusion again: \\u201cWhile obviously not many festival-goers are likely to have a \\u20185G\\u2019 phone by June, EE will be showing off what the network can do at its stand.\\u201d Once again, unspecified 5G. So, was the Glastonbury demo about 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb? Whatever, tickets sold out in less than 45 minutes.\\n\\nThe grand protest by potential attendees was both tragic and macabrely amusing: They were prepared to irradiate themselves constantly in huge numbers (up to 200,000 fans in attendance potentially using phones/smartphones), but fretted over \\u201c5G\\u201d, not even knowing it could have been their beloved 4G poison\\u2026reborn. Phone radiation is often overlooked.\\n\\nSimilarly, reports on the 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland clearly reflect the confusion and negligent use of \\u201c5G.\\u201d This Agence France-Presse story says, \\u201cBy early July, 334 antennae (sic) stations for 5G were operational across the country, authorities have told AFP.\\u201d Boy, watch out for authorities.\\n\\nAntenna location and density info aren\\u2019t revealed, but it could be urban or \\u2018near-urban.\\u2019 The number doesn\\u2019t seem to correspond to FLD in neighborhoods, but who knows, thanks to incomplete reporting (and perhaps misled authorities). The news reader is therefore in the dark about exactly what\\u2019s going on, but probably assumes it\\u2019s MMW. Due to\\u2026 \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s (but beginning much earlier). What was known then was later hushed in the runup to digital mobile telecom in 1991-2.\\n\\nThe decision was callously made long ago to put life/people at risk to have the technology (see History of Official Awareness below). Thus, the yes/no \\u201cexperiment\\u201d is not whether there will be harm from telecom/WiFi microwave, but the time window in which ongoing exposure damage \\u2014 across all frequencies and regardless of power level \\u2014 will manifest in a cascade of widespread intractable illness.\\n\\nNot to worry, though, that fate might be avoided: Ecosystem collapse could bring the house down beforehand. You might hear/see, \\u201cThe 5G race is on,\\u201d meaning market competition. The race of note, though, is between ecosystem collapse and human-health collapse.\\n\\nIn any case, here\\u2019s some of what\\u2019s happening in \\u2018real\\u2019 life. The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon. Carriers are choosing service areas for FR1, FR2 very carefully.\\n\\nT-Mobile has announced a nationwide 5Gmlb rollout at 600 MHz and an undisclosed application of \\u201c28 and 39\\u201d (see video), which means some 5Gmmw, almost certainly in cities.\\n\\nSprint\\u2019s plans are to run \\u201cLTE and 5G\\u201d simultaneously in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\nMentioned earlier, Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d (allegedly MMW \\u2013 5Gmmw) is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range to cover wide area\\u201d (5Gmlb), doesn\\u2019t say where.\\n\\nSacramento seems to be the most enthusiastic victim host for wireless. Here\\u2019s a gushing PR piece about a Verizon UWB installation at one Sacramento citizen\\u2019s home, with City officials attending. It features an external receiver. Sacramento also prides itself on opening the floodgates for \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more later).\\n\\nVerizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas, which could be its final destination. Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason. Ecocidal, terminally pathological 3G/4G still rages, again reflecting the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nThe forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. As noted earlier, drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for \\u201c18 million new\\u201d closely spaced fixtures nationwide. Given the above information on FR1 rollouts, there seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\nA report on new Qualcomm smartphone antennas supports the foregoing. It covers four bands between 26.5GHz and 40 GHz, but also antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 The QPM56xx RF module family works with the Snapdragon X50 modem to work in the sub-6GHz bands\\u2026\\u201d (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\nOne puzzle: It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) as specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs seem to disagree, saying 4G can handle IoT. Propaganda? Careless chatter? Who knows. It\\u2019s safe to assume, however, they refer to the new 4G/5Gmlb.\\n\\nSome opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. And the attempted widespread deployment of smart utility meters on 4G WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say. 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, because if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\nI didn\\u2019t bother spending the rest of my life trying to find if/where FLD installations are occurring. Anyone who\\u2019s seen close installations in any area, please share details in Comments.\\n\\nNow, if FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose. One, possibility of course, is optimized 5Gmlb performance, as in the past, although this shouldn\\u2019t often be necessary, due to the large cell and penetration of MLB.\\n\\nIn the entrained, FLD frame of mind, I was suspicious in Wireless Technology: \\u2026 (The 5G Locomotive section) of Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams\\u2019 statement in a 5/15/18 CNBC interview that antennas in your face is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019d say he was being coy, implying MLB, and being careful not to depict 5G accurately, since 5Gmmw must have increased FLD, while 5Gmlb, not for the most part.\\n\\nMcAdam touted 5Gmmw for smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality, all good reasons for planetary and health destruction. But remember, all the \\u201cSmart\\u201d out there now is WiFi, for which there is no 5Gmmw (although Verizon\\u2019s UWB Home Internet might qualify). \\u201cSmart\\u201d is the wireless tech word for monumentally stupid \\u2014 and for total surveillance and centralized coordination and control of daily life. See section The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026.\\n\\nNone of the above means things can\\u2019t change. It\\u2019s early. The MLB rollout could be just a prelude to an FLD/MMW invasion. If MMW gets a toe-hold and no one\\u2019s coming up provably sick, and people like it, it could weaken opposition and open floodgates.\\n\\nAnd there\\u2019s the question of how the many thousands of planned satellites (looking now like well more than 50,000) fit into the overall picture. Obviously, coverage comes immediately to mind, such as saturation in outlying areas? For IoT? One issue for satellites, though, is increased delay time (\\u201clatency\\u201d) due to distance. There could be a \\u2018division of labor\\u2019 among various services, such as ground for mobile and sats for entertainment.\\n\\nNote the promise of the nationwide sySTEMic programming to make kids into corporate plug-ins or hitech drones: \\u201cSTEM education emphasizes the value of a rigorous, interdisciplinary approach to education, allowing students to compete and succeed in a modern global marketplace.\\u201d How many dubious assumptions, claims and buzzwords in that PR flak?\\n\\nSTEM promises a wondrous, prosperous, techno-shiny future. It exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. In the developed world, the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum total of the latter. Speaking of which, once a city is immersed in \\u201csmart\\u201d tech, it\\u2019s likely to become a special target of hackers. Imagine the potential chaos.)\\n\\nThere have been various reports of adverse effects when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, almost certainly implying 5Gmmw. This would seem unlikely, virtually impossible, outside cities/populous areas.\\n\\nApparently, people see new infrastructure dense or not, or/and feel effects, and apparently assume MMW is in use, as we saw in the Bern example.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d harm stories consistently report symptoms existing before anyone even heard of 5G. Long before. All reported harms I\\u2019ve seen are classic 2G-4G symptoms, and mostly of the \\u2018Electrohypersensitivity\\u2019 type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\nRadiation/RF-level meters have been used to support claims. But RF meters don\\u2019t display frequencies, only power level within a range of frequencies. Ordinary meters, costing from around $120 to $400, top out at 8 GHz. 3G/4G mobile frequencies range from 600 megahertz to 2.5 GHz in the US, with 3.5 GHz coming. WiFi is 2.4 and 5 GHz. Recall, FCC defines 5Gmmw as 24 GHz to 90 GHz. Thus, current meters can\\u2019t read MMW.\\n\\nA true 5G phone would identify MMW (and MLB at this point). Professional (very expensive) meters cover low and high ranges into the upper GHz (I found one 10 MHz to 220 GHz), but also don\\u2019t display frequencies, so all frequencies present still couldn\\u2019t be identified.\\n\\nLong-term exposure, perhaps a cumulative effect, is playing into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Thus, if there is harm when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, what\\u2019s shown by existing meters? Not understood by victims and reporters? 4G, one way or another. Hysteria-induced confusion.\\n\\nOne hawker claims its meter can read \\u201c5G\\u201d based on the fact that two new MLB frequencies are used for 5G (mlb). Any old meter does this. This ruse brought to you by \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nMeters are interesting, but not really helpful for most people. Radiation is everywhere; no amount of exposure is safe; most bio-effects below heating are power-independent; and effects may be cumulative (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nA meter might come in handy for someone with outward symptoms and using some form of shielding, for example. It could be seen at what level symptoms abate \\u2013 which doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops. Most likely, it\\u2019s palliation, but it can still save much grief and help people function.\\n\\nWe can come to cautious conclusion about the frequency present by type of effect. Known effects of MMW (a limited volume of science, though growing) differ from MLB effects long reported in the voluminous dismissed science.\\n\\nMMW potentially threatens skin and eyes, but more effects are being reported, although sometimes \\u2018stretched.\\u2019 For example, a paper cited (in an article by a prominent scientist who must remain anonymous) to show that 5Gmmw impacts \\u201cheart rate variability\\u201d was a military directed-energy study (see Author Information) using 94 GHz at 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2). That\\u2019s essentially the \\u201cADS\\u201d system noted earlier.\\n\\nNot only is 75 mW 75 times the main FCC limit (limits vary with frequency), but 94 is a frequency higher than the upper limit of 5Gmmw defined by the FCC, and certainly wouldn\\u2019t be used in mobile applications. Making cases?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not that MMW can\\u2019t create MLB effects, but it\\u2019s a bit speculative at this point. It\\u2019s possible, however \\u201c\\u2026since nerves, blood vessels and other electrically conducting structures can carry radiation-induced currents deep into the body\\u201d (see section 5G is qualitatively and quantitatively different from 4G)\\n\\nAntenna technology called MIMO (pron. my-mo) has been around for about a decade now for MLB. The more recent development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, meaning many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming (and receiving) beams of radiation. It looks to be destined for both FR1 and FR2 (a virtual necessity for MMW). As noted, Sprint will use this at for 5G at 3.5 GHz.\\n\\nOne question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose an additional threat. It\\u2019s possible they have an effect different from traditional antennas. Also, it seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of many focused beams, although being immersed in a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\nIn any case, aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying a beam from point to point (line of sight) avoids high power output per beam, since penetration of intervening structures isn\\u2019t required.\\n\\nHysteria often warns of outrageously high power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d As noted, effects occur at all levels below heating, which is why 3G/4G need to go. And it would not behoove the industry for people to suddenly be suffering heat damage.\\n\\nDetails of several typical news reports follow. Most demonstrate the fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one shows a more general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\nThe story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from a Verizon antenna installed near the home illustrates confusion. The first video on this page shows testimony before the Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with the mayor present.\\n\\nThe type of antenna isn\\u2019t given. But it\\u2019s probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. We learned from the \\u201cgushing PR piece\\u201d cited in the 5G Rollouts section that Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strange that the testimony date precedes the stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests prior to the grand \\u201cunveiling,\\u201d so it could have been an early \\u201cHome\\u201d antenna. Or maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\nThe opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that ambiguous statement mean to the person who wrote it? To the viewer? The incident suggests harm (cold/flu symptoms) from 5Gmmw but still reinforces the importance of knowing what we mean when we say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\nThe mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although her prepared speech commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but the suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness, even though levels \\u201care still very high\\u201d will certainly be taken officially as \\u201ccorrelation,\\u201d not proof or even evidence.\\n\\nTypically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\nBottom line: Which 5G is present is academic, since the pre-\\u201c5G\\u201d endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal. Focus on \\u201c5G\\u201d is like fretting about a wildfire 10 miles away while your house is burning down.\\n\\nOne of the more outrageous opposition-induced hysterias in recent times is a story from Gateshead, a town in northern UK near the North Sea, that new LED street lights (no microwave fixtures on them, just the lights) were emitting \\u201c5G\\u201d and causing health issues. This was carelessly picked up by other outlets. No one gave a moment\\u2019s thought to the likelihood that it might be LED lights themselves.\\n\\nA news report from Cincinnati clearly demonstrates that folks are in the dark about what 5G is, thanks to hysteria. And a fairly well-known one from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, to its credit, shows a better general awareness of wireless threat. But both demonstrate questionable thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make them safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem).\\n\\nScroll down this page to see an RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story. Regardless of one\\u2019s opinion of RT, this one\\u2019s a great and accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\nThe original story from 9/20/19 (now includes an update) is a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria,\\u201d since no one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers up to this point. It involves a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that \\u201cpeople fear\\u201d will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d.\\n\\nThe 9/27/19 update shows a video interview with a concerned nurse, a conditioned \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacking understanding of the wireless threat. She\\u2019ll feel safer if that nasty tall tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\nThe tall, new-look tower with the cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video) is clearly not the massive MIMO 5Gmmw/small-cell type shown in the 5G-phone report in the 5G Rollouts section. That was Verizon\\u2019s.\\n\\nThe update also says the tower is Sprint\\u2019s. As noted, Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using massive MIMO. It being a Sprint tower, it\\u2019s not MMW. The \\u201c5G\\u201d fear was an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\nSo what\\u2019s in the cylindrical fixture? Could be 4G (LTE), 5Gmlb (\\u201c5G\\u201d), WiFi as well? WiMax? One question \\u2013 is it MIMO? Massive? Anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\nThe update notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are also popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman David Weissmann confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what? From what we\\u2019ve seen of Verizon, probably 5Gmlb, i.e., 4G LTE on FR1 steroids.\\n\\nThe San Joaquin report, from 3/12/19 also concerns a tall tower with a cylindrical fixture. But this isn\\u2019t about 5G, but about \\u201ca cell tower\\u201d being too close to an elementary school in Ripon with a \\u2018cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\n\\u201cAll in all, three teachers and four students have been battling various cancers since 2016,\\u201d as well as a 22-year-old former male student. Of course, those teachers and that young man \\u2018never\\u2019 used a wireless device, and never near that tower. Nor were they exposed to another tower or anyone else\\u2019s phone. This doesn\\u2019t seem to dawn on people.\\n\\nThe Ripon case is interesting. An independent expert was consulted, who contradicted official assurance that the tower tested within federal standards. He said he wouldn\\u2019t send his kids there, because kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed \\u2013 as if they\\u2019re not exposed 24/7 anywhere a phone/tower system is working, not only from towers, but many phones as well. And does he think that once you\\u2019re \\u201cdeveloped\\u201d it\\u2019s OK?\\n\\nSprint subsequently shut it down and agreed to relocate, guilty or not. The move was good PR, and indicates that companies and municipalities will back down \\u2013 probably to avoid litigation, since that could open floodgates.\\n\\nRipon is important for two more reasons. The first is the usually overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure (see History of Official Awareness below). It\\u2019s well known, for example, that effects from cigarette tobacco and ionizing radiation (like a hospital X-ray), are cumulative. There\\u2019s no reason wireless radiation should be any different.\\n\\nMost kids are heavily exposed in our wireless world, wherever they are \\u2013 many from conception, and even before that, especially to ovarian DNA damage. This is one egregious crime of the technology.\\n\\nThe second reason is the bogus advice that \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the false argument for slow death over quicker death, or the futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can even make things worse. The farther the source, the greater are reflection and refraction of signals, creating a far more chaotic condition for the body to handle. Any telecom/WiFi antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\nReducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usually usage tips but also lower exposure limits. Despite calls for the latter, it holds mostly for heating. For non-heating effects, lower power could even increase the threat, since there\\u2019s a good chance that the closer we get to the minute power levels used by biosystems for intercellular communication, a greater confusion sets in.\\n\\nWith regard to usage tips, \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures accumulate over time to engender serious disease \\u2013 of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem, whose damage these clever warnings for humans worsen.\\n\\nThe problem is that reliance on power level alone to determine safety is largely a convenience (there\\u2019s that fatal word again), not science. The reader doesn\\u2019t need to understand the following terms, just that there are several factors in play, including whether the signal is continuous or pulsed, the shape of the pulsations, the rise time, fall time and duration of the pulsations, the type and depth of modulation, the frequencies, and the bandwidth.\\n\\nTry to set a \\u201csafe\\u201d exposure limit based on all that. So they keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\nA corollary is that folks claiming harm seem to think it\\u2019s for the first time. This is fatal error. There are also stories wherein people or animals affected by, say, a Smart meter, regard symptom abatement when the meter is removed as complete recovery. More fatal error. People have no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway. By now, the reader should know why.\\n\\nAn Idaho organization, ehsidaho.com, collects reports on the incidence and effects of what\\u2019s being called electrohypersensitivity, or EHS. The term is misleading, because no living thing is unaffected by the radiation, whether it manifests outwardly or not. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 is suggested.\\n\\nAn estimated 35% of the population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\nClaire Edwards, a former UN staffer, top writer and wireless activist said to me in an email that an estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. The rest of society is virtually thumbing its nose at these unfortunate people. But they\\u2019ll also suffer if this red flag is ignored: As bad as this sensitivity is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad, either in incidence or severity, as things could quickly and easily get.\\n\\nIllness caused by wireless radiation is not new or unique to it, even though there are lists and categories of issues attributed to it. In medicine, a symptom can be caused by any number of influences, and a single influence can cause various symptoms.\\n\\nSo a big question is, how much of today\\u2019s ongoing ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 that is, defined and named prior to the wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to telecom/WiFi radiation (or even the whole radiation gamut to which we expose ourselves)?\\n\\nIf officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\nThus even for EMF-sick users \\u2014 who are much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors (oblivious) attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\nBut quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 is what must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\nManifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere (see The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026).\\n\\nIf we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\nOf the several historical documents acknowledging the deleterious effects of artificial electromagnetic fields denied by FCC, the definitive one for wireless tech seems to be a 1981 World Health Organization (WHO) report entitled Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973. (I\\u2019ve always thought it unfortunate and instructive that \\u201cenvironmental health\\u201d is not about techno-human torment of Earth, but concern about just payback for the tormentor).\\n\\nThe report is long, covering many aspects. It covers all telecom/WiFi frequencies, including MMW; but real-world harm for the last three decades has come, and continues from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\nAs forthright as the WHO publication purports to be, the Summary reveals a distressing ruthlessness. It\\u2019s all most people need to read to understand that \\u2018they\\u2019 knew. For reader convenience, a brief review follows.\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.3 Biological effects in experimental animals: It has been demonstrated that low-level, long-term exposure may induce effects in the nervous, haematopoietic (production of blood cells and platelets), and immuno-competent cell systems of animals. Such effects have been reported in small animals (rodents) exposed to incident power density levels as low as 0.1-1.0 mW/cm2\\u201d (\\u201cmW\\u201d = milliwatt \\u2013 one thousandth of a watt). So this is one tenth of one thousandth of a watt to one thousandth of a watt per square centimeter. FCC limit: one thousandth of a watt \\u2013 1 mW/cm2 (for frequencies 1500 MHz \\u2013 100 GHz).\\n\\n\\u201cThe reported effects on the nervous system include behavioural, bioelectrical, metabolic, and structural (at the cellular and subcellular levels) changes. Erythrocyte production and haemaglobin synthesis may be impaired and immunological reactivity changed.\\u201d OK so far (except for exploiting/hurting animals).\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.6: Health risk evaluation as a basis for exposure limits: \\u2026 A highly conservative approach would be to keep exposure limits close to natural background levels. However, this is not technically feasible [emphasis added]. A reasonable risk-benefit analysis has to be considered.\\u201d\\n\\nIs \\u201chighly conservative\\u201d a euphemism for \\u201csafe\\u201d? And what does \\u201cclose\\u201d mean? In any case, the \\u201cbackground level,\\u201c called the cosmic background is 0.0000000001 \\u2013 0.000000000000001 \\u00b5W/cm2 (\\u00b5W = microwatt \\u2013 one millionth of a watt). Thus, the higher background limit (first one) is one ten billionth of a millionth of a watt (sounds like just a few electrons to me \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nFCC limit is on the other side of the decimal point at 1000 \\u00b5W/cm2. a thousand millionths of a watt \\u2013 per square centimeter, that is. Frankly, the author\\u2019s head goes into a spin with these minuscule decimals, but it\\u2019s safe to say there\\u2019s a bit of a margin between FCC and Cosmos \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nThe FCC limit is outrageous even compared to the most conservative proposed \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit: .003 \\u2013 .006 \\u00b5W/cm2. and the BioInitiative Report authors say it might even need to be lower..\\n\\nImportantly, however, the cosmic variety is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed). That means there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limit after all: zero.\\n\\n\\u201cNot technically feasible\\u201d? Well, of course. Technology is more important than health in some minds. \\u201cReasonable risk-benefit\\u201d? The Summary doesn\\u2019t say how many sick or dead per million is reasonable. (Please see also)\\n\\nOne wonders if they were aware of earlier studies, referred to by Andrew Michrowski, PhD at the 2009 Toronto Whole Life Expo (see section, Key Testimony in Toronto in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMichrowski interprets the data for us: \\u201cAnalysis of 1950 -1974 mortality of 40,000 Korean War veterans shows that microwave exposure effect is cumulative [emphasis added] it affects all deaths \\u2026 doubling to tripling cancers of eye, brain and central nervous system, lymphatic and hematopoietic [blood-cell/platelet-forming] and digestive systems. This means that even \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures from wireless systems accumulate over the years and decades to engender serious diseases\\u201d (can\\u2019t be said too often).\\n\\nNor do we know if the Warsaw International Symposium or its WHO reviewers were aware that the US military and others conducted microwave stealth-weapon research in the 1950s. This technology became 2G. See Sections Assault: From Weapon to Telecom and Ultimate Atrocity in the Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nOpposition warnings frequently emphasize \\u2018protecting you and your family.\\u2019 The point having been made several times is worth repeating: The most dire threat is to the ecosystem, not humans. No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\nEnvironment usually suffers in the background of hysteria. One will see lists something like this: \\u201chealth, privacy, security, and the environment.\\u201d\\n\\nThose who offer exposure \\u201csolutions\\u201d or \\u201ctips\\u201d seem to forget that no form or amount of human protection does so for Nature. A false sense of security in being \\u201csafer\\u201d leads to continued use and support of the overall system, immeasurably intensifying that threat.\\n\\nInsects, for example, are highly susceptible to telecom/WiFi microwave, especially to MMW, which we haven\\u2019t even had yet. In the last quarter century or so, coinciding closely with the introduction of 2G, 75% of the biomass of insects has disappeared in otherwise protected areas in Germany. Meaning it\\u2019s probably worse where other threats co-exist.\\n\\nEmphatically: The wireless threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. We need to look at the context of wireless, which is technology, per se. And one thing is certain about most of that, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\nIn almost all cases, somewhere along the line from resource acquisition (especially mining) to manufacture, use, and disposal, advanced technology is chemically/energetically toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless encompasses the entire line of a process of Earth liquidation/sacrifice for human \\u201cneeds\\u201d \\u2013 money, convenience, and entertainment (see section The Price of Techno-Civilization in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMoving to \\u201cwired\\u201d telecom/WiFi will not stop this assault. Countries are under siege for resources. Nor will the Elite psyops \\u201cSustainable Development\\u201d and \\u201cClean Renewable Energy\\u201d stop it. But that\\u2019s another article.\\n\\nThe attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed. I ask that anyone who can name a major environmental or health crisis in which technology isn\\u2019t the cause or doesn\\u2019t play a major role, comment about it.\\n\\nLooking at the overall output of \\u201cconcerned\\u201d EMF scientists and activists, however, if one isn\\u2019t careful, one could conclude it\\u2019s thought that humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\nAnother major concern is disproportionate attention on local antennas, while a massive satellite program proceeds. At one point, up to 20,000 satellites were planned to blanket the globe. But the number keeps growing.\\n\\nMadman Elon Musk\\u2019s SpaceX had dibs on 12,000 for 5Gmmw. Here is news that Madman is applying for 30,000 more. Just 42,000 satellites will be about 5 times the total spacecraft launched since 1957 (8,500).\\n\\nSeveral other companies, including Boeing, OneWeb, Amazon, Facebook, not to mention Russia and China, mean many thousands more. Total madness could bring it to somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000. This considered sane. Why? Because insanity unrecognized as such has become the norm in the culture of toxic-technomasturbation.\\n\\nPollution. Some 150 tons of refined kerosene and 340 tons of liquid oxygen per Musk 5G launch (60 satellites, 400 kg each). Do the math, even for 12,000. There seems to be no concern for consequences, such as potential damage to the ozone layer, major interference with earth\\u2019s energy field, or even increased atmospheric CO2 (for the faithful). Not to mention, decline of breathable free oxygen (very cool dynamic graph).\\n\\nMuch seems to be up in the air on the satellite program. Since launches proceed in haste, the plan seems to be shoot them up first, answer proprietary questions later, dismissing anyone else\\u2019s. In Europe, there are currently calls for papers on satellite integration with 5G, with submissions deadline being the Ides of March 2020.\\n\\nNASA, NOAA, meteorologists, (and radio astronomers) have issued valid concerns about MMW. FCC has dismissed them, too. Yet, NASA intends to participate in this bit of insanity.\\n\\nMight such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates? Insane is a good word for it, but psychopathic puts a more specific tag on it. See subsections Same Old Story\\u2026 and \\u2026with a Twist in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nThe best way to beat 5G, on the ground at least, is to quit wireless tech flat. Little demand \\u2018down here\\u2019 could greatly reduce incentive to invest \\u2018up there\\u2019. If there is a total-surveillance and human-control system gestating in the technosphere, how much of a role could satellites play?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strongly suggested that an outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the one on earthbound antennas.\\n\\nTaking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\nAgain, a race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse. Allowing classic 4G (or even just 5G FR1) to continue potentiates imminent disaster. Both scenarios are in progress, but at the \\u2018deniable\\u2019 stage. When \\u2018undeniable\\u2019 sets in, the slope will almost certainly have become too steep and slippery.\\n\\nExperience shows that science-based appeals, to governments at all levels; to national and international regulatory bodies, and so on is an exercise in futility due to multiple factors, including corruption, disbelief, and intimidation. Old and chronic conditions.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s in the People\\u2019s hands now, at the commercial level. Either common sense prevails over addiction and selfishness, or we wait for the race to end and hope it\\u2019s not too late.\\n\\nGive up wireless per se or give up the future \\u2013 liberty first, then life. If not, then welcome all 5G, especially the satellites. Surrender to it will mercifully shorten the coming agony.\\n\\nPeter Tocci is a retired massage therapist and wellness consultant with an abiding interest in exploring \\u2018managed\\u2019 history, nefarious covert agendas, and mainstream/mainstream-alternative news-media dereliction, distortion and suppression.

Most \\u201c5G\\u201d opposition presents more like hysteria than fact.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d (in quotes) indicates the lack of a critical distinction that forms the basis of this article. Although \\u201c5G\\u201d and its implementation are confusing enough (not even the Industry has settled all details), compounding the problem unnecessarily is the output of most opposers, which suggests they don\\u2019t really know what it is \\u2013 or aren\\u2019t saying.\\n\\nOpposition includes erroneous information, omissions, sometimes propaganda \\u2013 and sometimes utter nonsense \\u2013 alongside some truth \\u2013 even from those who should know better, such as \\u201cconcerned scientists\\u201d.\\n\\nThe \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d mantra irresponsibly leaves environment, people, and communities in greater jeopardy than do the ominous facts.

Safety testing, history of official awareness of harm, and opposition priorities are also discussed.\\n\\nTwo Summaries have been published separately for fast-trackers. A Bullet Summary for those who\\u2019d rather pick and choose detail, and a Text Summary, for those who want a more general sweep. Both provide means for quickly accessing areas of particular interest. But reading the full text is strongly encouraged. A small number of revisions might not appear in the Summaries.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d confusion revolves around some technical things, but non-techies need not be intimidated. Easily understood basics are all one needs. Like musical notes, the signals to and from devices and towers are just vibrational frequencies. Comparison ends there, however, because telecom/WiFi frequencies are microwave radiation like in your microwave oven, not acoustic.\\n\\nMany people are familiar with frequency designations used in telecom/WiFi. But for a quick and easy \\u2018course\\u2019 in frequency (and wavelength) if needed, please read the first 4 paragraphs of The Physics section of Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (the section and article need key revisions in certain specifics, but the principles remain).\\n\\nNatural microwave radiation of vanishingly low power comes to Earth from the universe. It\\u2019s called the \\u2018cosmic background level\\u2019 \\u2013 what life has evolved in. Like man-made microwave, this energy wave has electric and magnetic properties and is called an electro-magnetic field (EMF). Opinions vary on its frequency range, one being that it covers the same range as artificial microwave, 300 MHz to 300 GHz \\u2013 the top section of the entire manmade radio frequency spectrum (3 KHz to 300 GHz).\\n\\nTelecom/WiFi microwave is greatly amplified compared to the background. It\\u2019s also digital. It\\u2019s an artificial, amplified, digital, polarized, modulated (pulsed) electrical and magnetic force.\\n\\nAll biological systems have electrical and magnetic properties as well. Thus, why you can be electrocuted; and why magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does what it does.\\n\\nDespite \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, all telecom/WiFi signals are fundamentally identical: Life-negative.\\n\\nTheir electromagnetic force interferes with critical functions controlled by the very low-power, highly sensitive electrical/magnetic properties of living systems \\u2014 regardless of frequency or any power level, including far below what would \\u2018microwave\\u2019 (heat or cook) you.\\n\\nIf an electrical device causes static or otherwise interferes with a radio (as in static), music system, or any electrical circuit, it\\u2019s called \\u201cradio frequency\\u201d (RF) interference. The FCC strictly regulates this.\\n\\nWireless telecom/WiFi radio frequency interference gives living systems inaudible static. By embracing scientific fraud, the FCC very poorly regulates this. One reason is, it can\\u2019t be properly regulated anyway \\u2013 and they know it.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging that 2G-4G is seriously harmful, even ultimately fatal (but only if not properly \\u2018managed,\\u2019) opposers argue (with a straight face) that \\u201c5G\\u201d frequencies and infrastructure will make a terminal situation worse. More fatal (no laughing now).\\n\\nInstead of \\u201cStop Wireless!\\u201d they emphasize the \\u201cnew\\u201d threat. Which it is not, fundamentally. Several ploys are \\u2018em-ployed\\u2019 to \\u2018make cases,\\u2019 as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nThe horrendous threat that opposition hysteria warns of is not \\u201c5G\\u201d per se, but wireless \\u2018techn-all-the-G\\u2019s\\u2019 per se. Wireless epitomizes the long-standing willingness of techno-adults to wreck the planet, poison the kids, and create illness in numerous ways, for money, convenience, and entertainment \\u2014 the three main selling points of wireless \\u2018technolo-G\\u2019.\\n\\nWith few exceptions, \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers cling to the fatal hope of continuing with 3G/4G wireless \\u2013 via proper use and management, of course. There have been appeals by scientists to (corrupted) official bodies, asking for what can\\u2019t exist \\u2013 safe, safer, or biologically based exposure limits. This is discussed in more detail in the \\u2018physics\\u2019 article above.\\n\\nThere is also every manner of device, gadget, clothing, shrouds, paint and metal to protect humans from a pathological threat that shouldn\\u2019t even exist. This is considered sane and clever. And does it make business.\\n\\nWhile business is being made, the worst threat by far proceeds \\u2013 ecosystem damage/collapse. It gets mentions in the hysteria, but rarely the keen, priority-one emphasis it demands.\\n\\nSome assertions below are solid, others \\u201cdepend,\\u201d some are of necessity speculation. Things can change rapidly. Therefore, anyone having verifiable information clarifying, enhancing, correcting, or, especially, refuting anything said here, PLEASE share via Comments. The goal is truth.\\n\\nBy reviewing this material, the reader should be well equipped to evaluate the output of pundits/scientists, websites, forums, summits, writers and reporters stressing the \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d.\\n\\nWithout any help from \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers, the \\u201cnext generation\\u201d wireless is very dangerous \\u2014 all by itself \\u2014 as is each previous G by itself. But due to hysteria (illogic, inaccuracies and omissions), most opposition is also dangerous by itself.\\n\\nNot much has changed since this PC Mag article was published in 1/2019. And that doesn\\u2019t cover all critical aspects.\\n\\nConfusion begins right off the bat with the term \\u201c5G.\\u201d It\\u2019s being flung carelessly about, in articles, protests, news reports, corporate bulletins, by politicians \\u2013 even by scientists, and in submissions and comments to official bodies.\\n\\nAlmost always implied when \\u201c5G\\u201d is uttered \\u2013 especially, \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d or \\u201c5G crisis\\u201d \\u2013 is use of the \\u2018extremely high frequency\\u2019 (EHF) range of microwave radiation often called \\u201cmillimeter wave\\u201d (MMW). This causes misunderstanding and potential danger.\\n\\nOverall, EHF is specified as 30 GHz to 300 GHz, and wavelength 10 millimeters to 1mm respectively. Only a small portion of that range is used in high-frequency 5G operation, and is defined in the US by the FCC as 24 GHz to 90 GHz.\\n\\nAs explained below in 5G Rollouts, for accuracy one must at least distinguish between 1) \\u2018small-cell\\u2019 infrastructure and 5G/small cells per se; 2) between 5G infrastructure and 5G high-frequency radiation; 3) between antennas and their enclosures, and **4) between high frequency 5G and mid-/low-band 5G, the signaling long used for 2G-4G iterations.\\n\\nNew terms are offered here for consistency and for clarifying hysteria-induced misunderstanding and confusion: \\u201c5G millimeter wave\\u201d (5Gmmw) for high frequency; \\u201c5G mid-/low-band\\u201d (5Gmlb) for traditional 2G-4G frequencies being called 5G (more below). \\u201cEnclosure\\u201d is a housing for antennas (sending/receiving elements). A \\u201cfixture\\u201d is a mounted enclosure.\\n\\nOne might see warnings such as: 1) \\u201c5G small cells are not small\\u201d; 2) the installations can be \\u201chundreds of pounds, right in your front yard\\u201d; and 3) antennas will be densely located \\u2014 \\u201cevery few homes.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSmall cell\\u201d is regularly misused, even by the Industry. Accurately speaking, a cell is not an antenna, but the effective area/range of an antenna\\u2019s radiation. 5Gmmw has a short range, which decreases with higher frequency. Thus, its cell is comparatively small.\\n\\nAlso, MMW can easily be blocked, even by even leaves and heavy rain, which deficiency increases with increasing frequency. Both drawbacks can be improved with a substantial power boost, but this also becomes a problem with energy cost and exposure levels, and so is not under consideration. Energy consumption is a major concern for the industry, which is feverishly at work to solve it.\\n\\nShort range and easy \\u2018blockability\\u2019 require more fixture locations, which hysteria frets about, rarely noting the distinction that 5Gmlb makes a large cell and is not blocked. Call it nitpicking if you will, but why not be accurate instead of creating misconception or \\u2018making cases\\u2019?\\n\\n\\u201cFLD\\u201d is for fixture location density, and common hysteria about how it will be implemented are in serious question (more later).\\n\\nOne interesting discovery came up while working on this article: Small cells are small but not new, and were not developed for 5G. Small cells have long been deployed in 3G and 4G networks and have become an industry choice to deliver MMW and enable better MLB performance if needed.\\n\\nTraditionally, there have been three types of small cells (more now), identified as they should be by antenna range. Some early deployments were in the US in 2007 and in the UK and Europe in 2009. \\u201cAccording to Small Cell Forum (who would have thought?), 18 million small cells had been deployed globally for various applications by the end of 2016.\\u201d\\n\\nBut haven\\u2019t we been led in a virtually deliberate way from the outset, and even continue to be, to think that 5G is small cells/MMW? Saying \\u201c5G\\u201d to indicate only these two things, or not specifying what you mean, is irresponsible, inaccurate, and misleading, as we\\u2019ll see.\\n\\nA 10/8/19 bulletin from Project Censored was forwarded to me via an email group that received it from Joel M. Moskowitz, PhD, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at UC Berkeley. A typically careless statement consisting of an error and a question mark says, \\u201cThe telecom industry is promoting the replacement of the current cellular network, known as 4G, with a new generation of higher frequency 5G wavelengths to power the \\u201cInternet of Things\\u2026\\u201d As a generalization, this is either shameful unawareness of the current scenario or untruth/propaganda, as we\\u2019ll also see.\\n\\n5G opposition also asserts that the skin\\u2019s (spiral) sweat ducts act as \\u201creceiving antennas.\\u201d This refers to an Israeli study, \\u201cThe human skin as a sub-THz receiver \\u2013 Does 5G pose a danger to it or not?\\u201d\\n\\nFrequency ranges don\\u2019t transition abruptly, but sub-THz usually means a range of 300 GHz down to 90, which is the upper end of FCC 5Gmmw.\\n\\nThe study Abstract uses two unquantified terms, \\u201csub-terahertz band\\u201d and \\u201csub-THz region.\\u201d I think \\u201cregion\\u201d is more accurate, meaning the range, or \\u201cspectrum\\u201d as understood in tech circles. \\u201cBand\\u201d is used to designate a single frequency, but also is an interval between a lower and upper frequency. For instance, a transmission between 40 and 50 MHz is a 10 MHz band (width).\\n\\nStudy frequencies were 75 GHz to 110 GHz. No wireless provider I\\u2019m aware of (in the US) has announced a mobile 5Gmmw service anywhere near 75 GHz. There was no explanation in the Abstract why announced commercial frequencies were not used.\\n\\nPower-level exposure limits at the user end are expressed in watts per area, usually square meter or square centimeter. No such levels are provided for the targets used, but maybe that\\u2019s not relevant in this case.\\n\\nThe highest commercial frequency I could find being tested is in the UK (though also approved for US), is 60 GHz. At least one rural test area is reportedly using a 60 GHz \\u201cwireless mesh\\u201d (interior network of interacting antennas) for \\u2018super WiFi.\\u2019 Not for mobile and still not up to 75 GHz.\\n\\nInteresting is that other UK rural testbeds are running unused TV bands called \\u201cTV white space\\u201d \\u2014 the old VHF to UHF frequencies, mostly MHz bands. This is 5G, mind you.\\n\\nHowever, bandwidths 71 to 76 GHz, 81 to 86 GHz and 92 to 95 GHz are available in the US for \\u201chigh-density\\u201d (high power) \\u201cfixed wireless access\\u201d services: \\u201c\\u2026the operation of wireless communication devices or systems used to connect two fixed locations (e.g., building to building or tower to building) with a radio or other wireless link\\u2026\\u201d, which would have to be line-of-sight and are not for mobile.\\n\\nAs noted, the higher the frequency, the greater are transmission challenges, so high-density bands would be very tight beams, with minimal to no obstacles and no human exposure (watch out, pigeons). Due to excess electricity consumption, MMW signals probably won\\u2019t be power boosted sufficiently to penetrate buildings, but be brought in via cable from an external receiver, then be distributed via a wireless network.\\n\\nStudy conclusion: \\u201cWe are raising a warning flag against the unrestricted use of sub-THz technologies for communication, before the possible consequences for public health are explored.\\u201d This seems sane enough \\u2013 within the insane context called wireless telecom/WiFi. See Wireless Technology: The Plain Physics & Biophysics (needs updating).\\n\\nBut \\u201cunrestricted\\u201d at least suggests the impossible, that restrictions could prevent all trouble. Note also \\u201cpossible consequences.\\u201d This can\\u2019t be valid for harm in general, which is a fact long understood \\u2013 almost three decades before 2G came out (see History of Official Awareness).\\n\\nWhen this warning is given, we don\\u2019t hear that the \\u201cwarning flag\\u201d would apply conceptually to all G\\u2019s; presumes there is a safe dose of MLB somewhere; and, as usual, neglects the ecosystem. But \\u2014 enough for protesters to say sweat ducts are \\u201c5G\\u201d antennas? Making cases? I confess I fell for this one in my early research on wireless. A more likely, but still speculative, concern is discussed in Reports of \\u201c5G\\u201d Harm.\\n\\nAnother common warning, \\u201c5G is a weapon,\\u201d usually refers to the military\\u2019s Active Denial System, a \\u201cnon-lethal\\u201d microwave device for dispersing crowds by heating the skin. It\\u2019s a high density (power) millimeter wave at 95 GHz \\u2013 hardly commercial 5Gmmw.\\n\\nMMW is no more weapon than 2G-4G. Wireless telecom, beginning with 2G, is adapted stealth-weapon technology which uses very low power. The entire wireless system, not just \\u201c5G\\u201d, is a potential weapon on various levels (more below).\\n\\nAlso, high-enough density microwave \\u2014 at a \\u2018lowly\\u2019 2.5 GHz, for example \\u2014 will cook you like a microwave oven (2.45 GHz). That is, through and through, unlike ADS. At commercial power levels, 5Gmmw will not.\\n\\nA powerful Air Force radar system called Pave Paws at three US locations will cook you in a nanosecond at 420 to 450 MHz. Installations have two large circular arrays of antenna elements, each array radiating 580 kilowatts (!) It can detect a basketball at 12 miles, and small planes caught in the beam have blown up. So don\\u2019t swallow the rhetoric about telecom MMW weaponry.\\n\\nI was unable to find a range of ADS power output, but did find a military \\u201cdirected energy\\u201d study calling out 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2) at 94 GHz (see Reports of Harm). ADS power is adjustable, however, enough to be used as a lethal weapon. But \\u2013 \\u2018making cases\\u2019 again?\\n\\nMicrowave ovens operate from 600 to 1200 watts. By comparison, maximum output of traditional cell towers is 10 watts \\u2013 phones, 2 watts. The higher frequency/shorter wavelength was chosen for ADS to limit penetration depth. Not saying that\\u2019s a good thing, not to mention it\\u2019s misleading (see Reports of Harm).\\n\\nFinding a wattage output figure for new, 5G MLB or MMW antennas proved fruitlessly time consuming (anyone?), but I did find a study establishing a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for a particular 5Gmmw antenna design for 28 and 38 GHz.\\n\\nSAR is an expression of how much radiation from a phone is absorbed over time by the body. It\\u2019s expressed in watts per kilogram (W/kg). Values were \\u201c\\u20260.37 and 1.34 W/kg [up to] 2 W/kg. Current FCC SAR standard is 1.6W/kg. This is given just for a sense of comparison, because SAR is useless for determining the amount of radiofrequency (RF) absorption in biosystems during typical conditions of use. See Safety Testing below.\\n\\nMany opposers suggest that 3G/4G/WiFi can be made reasonably safe. Others understand that impossibility, but seem too habituated and addicted to do the right thing. As noted in the Introduction, techno-humans are adept at sickening and killing themselves, poisoning the kids, and destroying environment for money, convenience and entertainment.\\n\\n\\u201cNo \\u20185G\\u2019 safety studies have been conducted or funded by the Federal Communications Commission or the telecom industry, and none is planned.\\u201d Or simply, \\u201c5G has not been tested for safety\\u201d. Or the like. No such claims provide the facts.\\n\\nThat the FCC and Industry openly admit this is sometimes tossed into the pot of \\u201c5G\\u201d terror, whereas, the real terror is wireless tech per se. Inherent in this ploy is the erroneous implication that 2G-4G were tested (a yes and no proposition).\\n\\nIn 1996, FCC adopted the standard identified as ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992. There were \\u2018window dressings\\u2019 in 2004, 2005, and 2010, and, like the original, covered frequencies from 3 KHz to 300 GHz, in which range MMW is included. The latest is ANSI/IEEE C95.1-2019. (Overall \\u2018microwave\\u2019 is considered to be 300 MHz (.3 GHz) to 300 GHz.\\n\\nThe Commission\\u2019s assertion that \\u201c5G\\u201d poses no risk and needs no testing is based on the fraudulent IEEE \\u2018testing\\u2019 it adopted in 1996 to run interference for 3G. That is, if the radiation doesn\\u2019t heat you, it can\\u2019t harm you.\\n\\nThis author warned of this response by FCC in February 2019 as \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria was powering up: Could Opposition to 5G (per se) Be Ill Advised? Exposure limits worldwide are based on the ANSI/IEEE C95.1 fraud.\\n\\nPeer reviewed independent science, as early as the 1950s and still going, demonstrating myriad effects at non-heating levels, brings the integrity of C95.1-1992 through 2019 into question. Was *proper* testing ever done? Instead of clarifying this, hysteria makes the blanket claim. Making cases.\\n\\nThe FCC discredits or merely dismisses existing science and such questions: \\u2018No convincing evidence exists, but we\\u2019re keeping an eye on it.\\u2019 The blatant criminality of the FCC with respect to wireless/EMF is clearly demonstrated by older historical documents (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nHysteria often resorts to another \\u2018ploy on words\\u2019 pertaining to 2G-4G, and used even by scientists, as seen near the end of this report: \\u201cThe current FCC exposure limits are outdated.\\u201d The word implies that standards were at one time valid or sufficient, when they were never any such thing, for any living thing.\\n\\n\\u201cOutdated\\u201d always comes with the even more irresponsible suggestion that \\u201csafe\\u201d, \\u201csafer\\u201d, or \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limits are needed, when no such thing has been demonstrated or can exist. Despite this, new limits are proposed and stubbornly called for \\u2014 in spite of the consensus that no safe level has even been published for fetuses.\\n\\nApparently, that\\u2019s not of sufficient concern to call for \\u201cStop Wireless Technology!\\u201d instead of \\u201cStop 5G!\\u201d We\\u2019ll figure that fetus part out later.\\n\\nFor details on the original \\u2018safety\\u2019 testing \\u2013 scientific fraud, that is, on which power-level exposure limits worldwide are based \\u2013 see Sections Cell Phone Output and Exposure Limits for Users in the article Wireless Technology: Ultra Convenient. Endlessly Entertaining. Criminally Instigated. Terminally Pathological.\\n\\nMajor emphasis from the outset in mainstream opposition has been on millions of new, closely spaced installations nationwide, up and down \\u2018Your Street USA,\\u2019 due to the short range and easy block-ability of MMW. But things seem to be developing differently for now, as we\\u2019ll see. As noted, even the Industry hasn\\u2019t settled on final arrangements (pun intended).\\n\\nThe following synthesis is the result of wading through too many articles to give credit to any one. Some sources tell varying stories about the same thing, and even disagree with each other considerably.\\n\\nSo here goes: A new \\u201c5G NR\\u201d international wireless standard has been issued, specifying two frequency ranges: 5G NR bands FR1 & 5G NR bands FR2. Number one is for current bands below 6 GHz (5Gmlb), such as 600MHz, 1900MHz, and 2.5GHz; two is for MMW \\u2014 mostly 24 to 40 GHz for mobile, and higher for special applications (not mobile). In the near term, public WiFi will remain separate at MLB, 2.45 GHz and 5 GHz, but Verizon, for example, is offering 5Gmmw home internet/WiFi (not mobile) in limited areas of four cities.\\n\\n5G NR entails several new technologies needing only a mention at this point, including especially \\u201cMIMO\\u201d antennas for small cells and \\u2018beamforming\\u2019 (more later).\\n\\nHowever, 5G NR FR1 can use the same towers as 4G, but will need new antennas. It has the same reach and penetration, but with shorter delay, while providing up to 35 percent more speed. The wireless addict\\u2019s dream. When you think about it, FR1 should really be 5G, and 5Gmmw, 6G.\\n\\nPlans are also in place for deployments using the unlicensed, Citizens Broadband Radio Service 3.5 GHz band, and all key players really want in. This is MLB called 5G, mind you.\\n\\nThings get a bit stickier when it comes to needing a new phone or not. Many current phones should be able to get updates to process FR1, but a new phone is needed for FR2. Generally, the \\u201ctech\\u201d advice is not to move yet, and here\\u2019s an example with Samsung\\u2019s $1300 5G Galaxy S10 being tested in Chicago (good shot of a 5Gmmw \\u201cnode\\u201d here).\\n\\nThe \\u201chold off\\u201d sentiment is conveyed also in this article. What it amounts to at this writing is that 5Gmmw is virtually at a \\u201cdemo\\u201d stage, not full coverage and service, even in town.\\n\\nMany \\u201c5G\\u201d opposers continue to use traditional 3G/4G/WiFi wireless, either knowing the danger or believing it\\u2019s safe, or will be, because they just want it. A possible motive driving hysteria?\\n\\nAnother possible motive for \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria, or maybe just the effect it\\u2019s having, is to create a threat on the ground to draw resistance and to distract attention from the satellite program, a much more sinister development (see Examining Priorities below).\\n\\nThe disconnect about dangers brings up a story that drew wide attention at the time, especially in the UK, and one that seems to present a puzzle. It\\u2019s about the 6/26 2019 Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, Somerset County, England. It\\u2019s not strictly a \\u201crollout\\u201d story, more a system demo/test, but a decision was announced about installing \\u201c5G\\u201d network towers on festival grounds,\\n\\nDespite the fact that \\u201cGlastonbury officials [said] that move will allow festival attendees to access the Internet on their smartphones at faster speeds,\\u201d the announcement created a huge protest. In this story, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G are mentioned, but \\u201c5G\\u201d is not specified as MLB or MMW \\u2014 as anything, in other words. Is this hysteria-induced negligence?\\n\\nThe protest article is laced with dubious statements, notably the wearingly repeated one that \\u201c5G\\u201d constitutes a \\u201cmassive experiment on all species\\u201d. Even some much-admired professional associates/contacts promote this irresponsible notion. I must respectfully, but strongly, disagree, because the erroneous implication is that 2G-4G were/are not an experiment. Paradoxically, they were/are and were/are not experiments. Distinctions must be made (more below).\\n\\nConfusion again: \\u201cWhile obviously not many festival-goers are likely to have a \\u20185G\\u2019 phone by June, EE will be showing off what the network can do at its stand.\\u201d Once again, unspecified 5G. So, was the Glastonbury demo about 5Gmmw or 5Gmlb? Whatever, tickets sold out in less than 45 minutes.\\n\\nThe grand protest by potential attendees was both tragic and macabrely amusing: They were prepared to irradiate themselves constantly in huge numbers (up to 200,000 fans in attendance potentially using phones/smartphones), but fretted over \\u201c5G\\u201d, not even knowing it could have been their beloved 4G poison\\u2026reborn. Phone radiation is often overlooked.\\n\\nSimilarly, reports on the 9/21/19 protest in Bern, Switzerland clearly reflect the confusion and negligent use of \\u201c5G.\\u201d This Agence France-Presse story says, \\u201cBy early July, 334 antennae (sic) stations for 5G were operational across the country, authorities have told AFP.\\u201d Boy, watch out for authorities.\\n\\nAntenna location and density info aren\\u2019t revealed, but it could be urban or \\u2018near-urban.\\u2019 The number doesn\\u2019t seem to correspond to FLD in neighborhoods, but who knows, thanks to incomplete reporting (and perhaps misled authorities). The news reader is therefore in the dark about exactly what\\u2019s going on, but probably assumes it\\u2019s MMW. Due to\\u2026 \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s crucial to keep in mind that all deleterious effects of EMF/RF were well understood by the wider scientific community, the UN/WHO, militaries and governments by the mid-1970s (but beginning much earlier). What was known then was later hushed in the runup to digital mobile telecom in 1991-2.\\n\\nThe decision was callously made long ago to put life/people at risk to have the technology (see History of Official Awareness below). Thus, the yes/no \\u201cexperiment\\u201d is not whether there will be harm from telecom/WiFi microwave, but the time window in which ongoing exposure damage \\u2014 across all frequencies and regardless of power level \\u2014 will manifest in a cascade of widespread intractable illness.\\n\\nNot to worry, though, that fate might be avoided: Ecosystem collapse could bring the house down beforehand. You might hear/see, \\u201cThe 5G race is on,\\u201d meaning market competition. The race of note, though, is between ecosystem collapse and human-health collapse.\\n\\nIn any case, here\\u2019s some of what\\u2019s happening in \\u2018real\\u2019 life. The two 5G FR setups can be illustrated by looking at what just three carriers are doing: T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon. Carriers are choosing service areas for FR1, FR2 very carefully.\\n\\nT-Mobile has announced a nationwide 5Gmlb rollout at 600 MHz and an undisclosed application of \\u201c28 and 39\\u201d (see video), which means some 5Gmmw, almost certainly in cities.\\n\\nSprint\\u2019s plans are to run \\u201cLTE and 5G\\u201d simultaneously in the 2.5 GHz band using \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO (more below). Which means it\\u2019s not bothering with MMW at all (although plans a merger with T-Mobile, who is).\\n\\nMentioned earlier, Verizon\\u2019s \\u201c5G Ultra Wideband\\u201d (UWB) called \\u201cVerizon 5G Home Internet\\u201d (allegedly MMW \\u2013 5Gmmw) is being run in Houston, Indianapolis, LA and Sacramento. But it \\u201c\\u2026will also deploy 5G technology on lower frequency bands including 700 MHz-2500 MHz frequency range to cover wide area\\u201d (5Gmlb), doesn\\u2019t say where.\\n\\nSacramento seems to be the most enthusiastic victim host for wireless. Here\\u2019s a gushing PR piece about a Verizon UWB installation at one Sacramento citizen\\u2019s home, with City officials attending. It features an external receiver. Sacramento also prides itself on opening the floodgates for \\u201cSmart City\\u201d status (more later).\\n\\nVerizon\\u2019s 5Gmmw, for mobile, is being offered/tested in urban areas, which could be its final destination. Santa Rosa typifies cities forestalling \\u201c5G\\u201d for precautionary reasons. Right move, very wrong reason. Ecocidal, terminally pathological 3G/4G still rages, again reflecting the danger of \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nThe forgoing rollouts are all being called 5G. As noted earlier, drawing most early 5G protest was, and is, the expected need for \\u201c18 million new\\u201d closely spaced fixtures nationwide. Given the above information on FR1 rollouts, there seems to be serious question about this.\\n\\nA report on new Qualcomm smartphone antennas supports the foregoing. It covers four bands between 26.5GHz and 40 GHz, but also antennas for MLB: \\u201c\\u2026a four-member family of radio modules designed for larger cell 5G coverage \\u2013 that is, outside the dense urban areas and indoor environments\\u2026 The QPM56xx RF module family works with the Snapdragon X50 modem to work in the sub-6GHz bands\\u2026\\u201d (5Gmlb, emphasis added).\\n\\nOne puzzle: It\\u2019s widely held that the Internet of Things (IoT) as specific to 5Gmmw, but two Israeli Qualcomm techs seem to disagree, saying 4G can handle IoT. Propaganda? Careless chatter? Who knows. It\\u2019s safe to assume, however, they refer to the new 4G/5Gmlb.\\n\\nSome opposers say MMW isn\\u2019t needed for car-to-car communication. And the attempted widespread deployment of smart utility meters on 4G WiFi supports what the Qualcomm techs say. 5Gmlb makes sense for IoT, because if IoT\\u2019s exclusive to MMW, and if that won\\u2019t be everywhere (on the ground), it trashes the concept.\\n\\nI didn\\u2019t bother spending the rest of my life trying to find if/where FLD installations are occurring. Anyone who\\u2019s seen close installations in any area, please share details in Comments.\\n\\nNow, if FLD is occurring outside major cities or populous areas, question arises about the purpose. One, possibility of course, is optimized 5Gmlb performance, as in the past, although this shouldn\\u2019t often be necessary, due to the large cell and penetration of MLB.\\n\\nIn the entrained, FLD frame of mind, I was suspicious in Wireless Technology: \\u2026 (The 5G Locomotive section) of Verizon CEO Lowell McAdams\\u2019 statement in a 5/15/18 CNBC interview that antennas in your face is \\u201c\\u2026one of the myths about 5G\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019d say he was being coy, implying MLB, and being careful not to depict 5G accurately, since 5Gmmw must have increased FLD, while 5Gmlb, not for the most part.\\n\\nMcAdam touted 5Gmmw for smart cities, driverless cars and virtual reality, all good reasons for planetary and health destruction. But remember, all the \\u201cSmart\\u201d out there now is WiFi, for which there is no 5Gmmw (although Verizon\\u2019s UWB Home Internet might qualify). \\u201cSmart\\u201d is the wireless tech word for monumentally stupid \\u2014 and for total surveillance and centralized coordination and control of daily life. See section The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026.\\n\\nNone of the above means things can\\u2019t change. It\\u2019s early. The MLB rollout could be just a prelude to an FLD/MMW invasion. If MMW gets a toe-hold and no one\\u2019s coming up provably sick, and people like it, it could weaken opposition and open floodgates.\\n\\nAnd there\\u2019s the question of how the many thousands of planned satellites (looking now like well more than 50,000) fit into the overall picture. Obviously, coverage comes immediately to mind, such as saturation in outlying areas? For IoT? One issue for satellites, though, is increased delay time (\\u201clatency\\u201d) due to distance. There could be a \\u2018division of labor\\u2019 among various services, such as ground for mobile and sats for entertainment.\\n\\nNote the promise of the nationwide sySTEMic programming to make kids into corporate plug-ins or hitech drones: \\u201cSTEM education emphasizes the value of a rigorous, interdisciplinary approach to education, allowing students to compete and succeed in a modern global marketplace.\\u201d How many dubious assumptions, claims and buzzwords in that PR flak?\\n\\nSTEM promises a wondrous, prosperous, techno-shiny future. It exerts direct impact \\u2014 to advantage or disaster. In the developed world, the former hasn\\u2019t begun to \\u201cjustify\\u201d the sum total of the latter. Speaking of which, once a city is immersed in \\u201csmart\\u201d tech, it\\u2019s likely to become a special target of hackers. Imagine the potential chaos.)\\n\\nThere have been various reports of adverse effects when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, almost certainly implying 5Gmmw. This would seem unlikely, virtually impossible, outside cities/populous areas.\\n\\nApparently, people see new infrastructure dense or not, or/and feel effects, and apparently assume MMW is in use, as we saw in the Bern example.\\n\\n\\u201c5G\\u201d harm stories consistently report symptoms existing before anyone even heard of 5G. Long before. All reported harms I\\u2019ve seen are classic 2G-4G symptoms, and mostly of the \\u2018Electrohypersensitivity\\u2019 type (\\u201cEHS,\\u201d a misnomer, see Idaho story near end of this section).\\n\\nRadiation/RF-level meters have been used to support claims. But RF meters don\\u2019t display frequencies, only power level within a range of frequencies. Ordinary meters, costing from around $120 to $400, top out at 8 GHz. 3G/4G mobile frequencies range from 600 megahertz to 2.5 GHz in the US, with 3.5 GHz coming. WiFi is 2.4 and 5 GHz. Recall, FCC defines 5Gmmw as 24 GHz to 90 GHz. Thus, current meters can\\u2019t read MMW.\\n\\nA true 5G phone would identify MMW (and MLB at this point). Professional (very expensive) meters cover low and high ranges into the upper GHz (I found one 10 MHz to 220 GHz), but also don\\u2019t display frequencies, so all frequencies present still couldn\\u2019t be identified.\\n\\nLong-term exposure, perhaps a cumulative effect, is playing into \\u201c5G\\u201d harm. Thus, if there is harm when \\u201c5G\\u201d is turned on, what\\u2019s shown by existing meters? Not understood by victims and reporters? 4G, one way or another. Hysteria-induced confusion.\\n\\nOne hawker claims its meter can read \\u201c5G\\u201d based on the fact that two new MLB frequencies are used for 5G (mlb). Any old meter does this. This ruse brought to you by \\u201c5G\\u201d hysteria.\\n\\nMeters are interesting, but not really helpful for most people. Radiation is everywhere; no amount of exposure is safe; most bio-effects below heating are power-independent; and effects may be cumulative (see History of Official Awareness below).\\n\\nA meter might come in handy for someone with outward symptoms and using some form of shielding, for example. It could be seen at what level symptoms abate \\u2013 which doesn\\u2019t mean harm stops. Most likely, it\\u2019s palliation, but it can still save much grief and help people function.\\n\\nWe can come to cautious conclusion about the frequency present by type of effect. Known effects of MMW (a limited volume of science, though growing) differ from MLB effects long reported in the voluminous dismissed science.\\n\\nMMW potentially threatens skin and eyes, but more effects are being reported, although sometimes \\u2018stretched.\\u2019 For example, a paper cited (in an article by a prominent scientist who must remain anonymous) to show that 5Gmmw impacts \\u201cheart rate variability\\u201d was a military directed-energy study (see Author Information) using 94 GHz at 75 milliwatts per square centimeter (75 mW/cm2). That\\u2019s essentially the \\u201cADS\\u201d system noted earlier.\\n\\nNot only is 75 mW 75 times the main FCC limit (limits vary with frequency), but 94 is a frequency higher than the upper limit of 5Gmmw defined by the FCC, and certainly wouldn\\u2019t be used in mobile applications. Making cases?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not that MMW can\\u2019t create MLB effects, but it\\u2019s a bit speculative at this point. It\\u2019s possible, however \\u201c\\u2026since nerves, blood vessels and other electrically conducting structures can carry radiation-induced currents deep into the body\\u201d (see section 5G is qualitatively and quantitatively different from 4G)\\n\\nAntenna technology called MIMO (pron. my-mo) has been around for about a decade now for MLB. The more recent development is \\u201cmassive\\u201d MIMO, meaning many antenna elements in one enclosure for aiming (and receiving) beams of radiation. It looks to be destined for both FR1 and FR2 (a virtual necessity for MMW). As noted, Sprint will use this at for 5G at 3.5 GHz.\\n\\nOne question is whether massive MIMO antenna arrays themselves pose an additional threat. It\\u2019s possible they have an effect different from traditional antennas. Also, it seems one could get caught in a \\u2018crossfire\\u2019 of many focused beams, although being immersed in a sea of radiation hardly seems better.\\n\\nIn any case, aiming doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean higher power hitting you just because the beam is focused. Relaying a beam from point to point (line of sight) avoids high power output per beam, since penetration of intervening structures isn\\u2019t required.\\n\\nHysteria often warns of outrageously high power output with \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201csmall cells.\\u201d As noted, effects occur at all levels below heating, which is why 3G/4G need to go. And it would not behoove the industry for people to suddenly be suffering heat damage.\\n\\nDetails of several typical news reports follow. Most demonstrate the fatal error of thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make people safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem). Three show the effect of 5G hysteria \\u2013 one outrageously, and one shows a more general concern about wireless, per se.\\n\\nThe story of a Sacramento family alleging harm from a Verizon antenna installed near the home illustrates confusion. The first video on this page shows testimony before the Sacramento City Council, 6/25/19 \\u2013 with the mayor present.\\n\\nThe type of antenna isn\\u2019t given. But it\\u2019s probably a MMW fixture for \\u201c5G Home Internet\\u201d. We learned from the \\u201cgushing PR piece\\u201d cited in the 5G Rollouts section that Verizon 5G UWB launched 10/1/19 in Sacramento \\u2014 again with the mayor attending.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strange that the testimony date precedes the stated launch date. Maybe there had to be tests prior to the grand \\u201cunveiling,\\u201d so it could have been an early \\u201cHome\\u201d antenna. Or maybe the PR announcement date was carefully chosen for whatever reason.\\n\\nThe opening video display screen says, \\u201cChildren Sick After 4G/5G Small Cell Installation\\u2026\\u201d What does that ambiguous statement mean to the person who wrote it? To the viewer? The incident suggests harm (cold/flu symptoms) from 5Gmmw but still reinforces the importance of knowing what we mean when we say \\u201c5G\\u201d \\u2013 or \\u201c4G/5G\\u201d.\\n\\nThe mother seems to understand the general threat of wireless (although her prepared speech commits the \\u201coutdated\\u201d faux pas), but the suggestion that \\u201cshielding\\u201d solved the illness, even though levels \\u201care still very high\\u201d will certainly be taken officially as \\u201ccorrelation,\\u201d not proof or even evidence.\\n\\nTypically too, she seems not to consider that power level below heating, along with antenna proximity, make little to no difference in terms of ongoing harm.\\n\\nBottom line: Which 5G is present is academic, since the pre-\\u201c5G\\u201d endgame is the same \\u2013 fatal. Focus on \\u201c5G\\u201d is like fretting about a wildfire 10 miles away while your house is burning down.\\n\\nOne of the more outrageous opposition-induced hysterias in recent times is a story from Gateshead, a town in northern UK near the North Sea, that new LED street lights (no microwave fixtures on them, just the lights) were emitting \\u201c5G\\u201d and causing health issues. This was carelessly picked up by other outlets. No one gave a moment\\u2019s thought to the likelihood that it might be LED lights themselves.\\n\\nA news report from Cincinnati clearly demonstrates that folks are in the dark about what 5G is, thanks to hysteria. And a fairly well-known one from Ripon, San Joaquin County, CA, to its credit, shows a better general awareness of wireless threat. But both demonstrate questionable thinking that shutting down or moving a tower is going to make them safe or \\u201csafer\\u201d in general (of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem).\\n\\nScroll down this page to see an RT America report on Cincinnati, based on the original story. Regardless of one\\u2019s opinion of RT, this one\\u2019s a great and accurate example of common confusion, misleading information and \\u201c5G\\u201d hype sprinkled with fact.\\n\\nThe original story from 9/20/19 (now includes an update) is a case of \\u201cnew infrastructure/hysteria,\\u201d since no one seems to have been upset by 4G wireless or its towers up to this point. It involves a tall, cylindrical \\u201cmystery tower\\u201d that \\u201cpeople fear\\u201d will soon be sending out \\u201c5G signals\\u201d.\\n\\nThe 9/27/19 update shows a video interview with a concerned nurse, a conditioned \\u201c5G-hysteria\\u201d victim lacking understanding of the wireless threat. She\\u2019ll feel safer if that nasty tall tower with the \\u2018unknown effects\\u2019 goes away. Will she be safer?\\n\\nThe tall, new-look tower with the cylindrical fixture (shown in picture and video) is clearly not the massive MIMO 5Gmmw/small-cell type shown in the 5G-phone report in the 5G Rollouts section. That was Verizon\\u2019s.\\n\\nThe update also says the tower is Sprint\\u2019s. As noted, Sprint\\u2019s plans are to run in the 2.5 GHz band using massive MIMO. It being a Sprint tower, it\\u2019s not MMW. The \\u201c5G\\u201d fear was an assumption driven by hysteria.\\n\\nSo what\\u2019s in the cylindrical fixture? Could be 4G (LTE), 5Gmlb (\\u201c5G\\u201d), WiFi as well? WiMax? One question \\u2013 is it MIMO? Massive? Anyone\\u2019s guess.\\n\\nThe update notes that shorter, cylindrical black towers are also popping up \\u2014 Verizon\\u2019s. Verizon spokesman David Weissmann confirms they\\u2019re new small cellular towers currently broadcasting 4G LTE, but convertible to future \\u201c5G\\u201d (similar to Sprint\\u2019s story?), meaning what? From what we\\u2019ve seen of Verizon, probably 5Gmlb, i.e., 4G LTE on FR1 steroids.\\n\\nThe San Joaquin report, from 3/12/19 also concerns a tall tower with a cylindrical fixture. But this isn\\u2019t about 5G, but about \\u201ca cell tower\\u201d being too close to an elementary school in Ripon with a \\u2018cluster\\u2019 of cancer victims.\\n\\n\\u201cAll in all, three teachers and four students have been battling various cancers since 2016,\\u201d as well as a 22-year-old former male student. Of course, those teachers and that young man \\u2018never\\u2019 used a wireless device, and never near that tower. Nor were they exposed to another tower or anyone else\\u2019s phone. This doesn\\u2019t seem to dawn on people.\\n\\nThe Ripon case is interesting. An independent expert was consulted, who contradicted official assurance that the tower tested within federal standards. He said he wouldn\\u2019t send his kids there, because kids are still developing and shouldn\\u2019t be exposed \\u2013 as if they\\u2019re not exposed 24/7 anywhere a phone/tower system is working, not only from towers, but many phones as well. And does he think that once you\\u2019re \\u201cdeveloped\\u201d it\\u2019s OK?\\n\\nSprint subsequently shut it down and agreed to relocate, guilty or not. The move was good PR, and indicates that companies and municipalities will back down \\u2013 probably to avoid litigation, since that could open floodgates.\\n\\nRipon is important for two more reasons. The first is the usually overlooked threat of imminent disaster due to long-term exposure (see History of Official Awareness below). It\\u2019s well known, for example, that effects from cigarette tobacco and ionizing radiation (like a hospital X-ray), are cumulative. There\\u2019s no reason wireless radiation should be any different.\\n\\nMost kids are heavily exposed in our wireless world, wherever they are \\u2013 many from conception, and even before that, especially to ovarian DNA damage. This is one egregious crime of the technology.\\n\\nThe second reason is the bogus advice that \\u2018distance is your friend\\u2019 \\u2014 the false argument for slow death over quicker death, or the futility of \\u201creducing exposure.\\u201d Greater distance can even make things worse. The farther the source, the greater are reflection and refraction of signals, creating a far more chaotic condition for the body to handle. Any telecom/WiFi antenna to which any living thing is exposed is too close.\\n\\nReducing exposure comes in two forms \\u2013 usually usage tips but also lower exposure limits. Despite calls for the latter, it holds mostly for heating. For non-heating effects, lower power could even increase the threat, since there\\u2019s a good chance that the closer we get to the minute power levels used by biosystems for intercellular communication, a greater confusion sets in.\\n\\nWith regard to usage tips, \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures accumulate over time to engender serious disease \\u2013 of course, no one\\u2019s talking ecosystem, whose damage these clever warnings for humans worsen.\\n\\nThe problem is that reliance on power level alone to determine safety is largely a convenience (there\\u2019s that fatal word again), not science. The reader doesn\\u2019t need to understand the following terms, just that there are several factors in play, including whether the signal is continuous or pulsed, the shape of the pulsations, the rise time, fall time and duration of the pulsations, the type and depth of modulation, the frequencies, and the bandwidth.\\n\\nTry to set a \\u201csafe\\u201d exposure limit based on all that. So they keep it simple-y deadly.\\n\\nA corollary is that folks claiming harm seem to think it\\u2019s for the first time. This is fatal error. There are also stories wherein people or animals affected by, say, a Smart meter, regard symptom abatement when the meter is removed as complete recovery. More fatal error. People have no way of knowing they weren\\u2019t \\u2018due\\u2019 anyway. By now, the reader should know why.\\n\\nAn Idaho organization, ehsidaho.com, collects reports on the incidence and effects of what\\u2019s being called electrohypersensitivity, or EHS. The term is misleading, because no living thing is unaffected by the radiation, whether it manifests outwardly or not. \\u201cOES\\u201d \\u2013 Overt ElectroSensitivity \\u2013 is suggested.\\n\\nAn estimated 35% of the population suffers mild to moderate symptoms, with 3% to 10% \\u201cdevastating, life-altering.\\u201d\\n\\nClaire Edwards, a former UN staffer, top writer and wireless activist said to me in an email that an estimated 100 million suffer \\u2018OES\\u2019 globally. The rest of society is virtually thumbing its nose at these unfortunate people. But they\\u2019ll also suffer if this red flag is ignored: As bad as this sensitivity is, it\\u2019s not nearly as bad, either in incidence or severity, as things could quickly and easily get.\\n\\nIllness caused by wireless radiation is not new or unique to it, even though there are lists and categories of issues attributed to it. In medicine, a symptom can be caused by any number of influences, and a single influence can cause various symptoms.\\n\\nSo a big question is, how much of today\\u2019s ongoing ecosystem decline and rampant illness \\u2013 that is, defined and named prior to the wireless era \\u2013 is attributable in whole or part to telecom/WiFi radiation (or even the whole radiation gamut to which we expose ourselves)?\\n\\nIf officials even know (doubtful), they\\u2019re not telling. I suggest no one knows (although the perpetrators might be more aware), and not that many seem even to care; but it\\u2019s almost certainly huge.\\n\\nThus even for EMF-sick users \\u2014 who are much habituated, obsessed, and addicted \\u2014 seeing and feeling nothing doctors (oblivious) attribute to wireless, there\\u2019s little incentive to quit 3G/4G.\\n\\nBut quitting 3G/4G \\u2013 at the retail level \\u2013 is what must be done for survival, and that\\u2019s how to beat 5G \\u2014 on the ground, anyway. Allowing 4G to continue, with any level of exposure, potentiates the noted imminent effects \\u2013 eco-collapse and massive *overt* health crises.\\n\\nManifesto: Anyone who understands the fatal threat but still uses wireless technology \\u2013 for whatever tiring, self-involved \\u2018excuse\\u2019 \\u2013 or for the promise of safe exposure limits and exposure reduction \\u2013 is irradiating our source of life and fellow humans directly, with devices and by supporting the tower system \\u2018bathing\\u2019 everything 24/7. Such a user is an accessory before and during the fact to criminal behavior leading to ecocide and slow genocide. And, some researchers say, global enslavement in the technosphere (see The Real Reason for the Wireless \\u201cSeason?\\u201d in Wireless Technology: \\u2026).\\n\\nIf we don\\u2019t stop 3G/4G, welcome all 5G. Surrender will mercifully hasten an end to the coming agony.\\n\\nOf the several historical documents acknowledging the deleterious effects of artificial electromagnetic fields denied by FCC, the definitive one for wireless tech seems to be a 1981 World Health Organization (WHO) report entitled Environmental Health Criteria: Radiofrequency and Microwaves. Biologic Effects and Health Hazards of Microwave Radiation: Proceedings on International Symposium 1973. (I\\u2019ve always thought it unfortunate and instructive that \\u201cenvironmental health\\u201d is not about techno-human torment of Earth, but concern about just payback for the tormentor).\\n\\nThe report is long, covering many aspects. It covers all telecom/WiFi frequencies, including MMW; but real-world harm for the last three decades has come, and continues from digital 2G-4G frequencies.\\n\\nAs forthright as the WHO publication purports to be, the Summary reveals a distressing ruthlessness. It\\u2019s all most people need to read to understand that \\u2018they\\u2019 knew. For reader convenience, a brief review follows.\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.3 Biological effects in experimental animals: It has been demonstrated that low-level, long-term exposure may induce effects in the nervous, haematopoietic (production of blood cells and platelets), and immuno-competent cell systems of animals. Such effects have been reported in small animals (rodents) exposed to incident power density levels as low as 0.1-1.0 mW/cm2\\u201d (\\u201cmW\\u201d = milliwatt \\u2013 one thousandth of a watt). So this is one tenth of one thousandth of a watt to one thousandth of a watt per square centimeter. FCC limit: one thousandth of a watt \\u2013 1 mW/cm2 (for frequencies 1500 MHz \\u2013 100 GHz).\\n\\n\\u201cThe reported effects on the nervous system include behavioural, bioelectrical, metabolic, and structural (at the cellular and subcellular levels) changes. Erythrocyte production and haemaglobin synthesis may be impaired and immunological reactivity changed.\\u201d OK so far (except for exploiting/hurting animals).\\n\\n\\u201cSection 1.1.6: Health risk evaluation as a basis for exposure limits: \\u2026 A highly conservative approach would be to keep exposure limits close to natural background levels. However, this is not technically feasible [emphasis added]. A reasonable risk-benefit analysis has to be considered.\\u201d\\n\\nIs \\u201chighly conservative\\u201d a euphemism for \\u201csafe\\u201d? And what does \\u201cclose\\u201d mean? In any case, the \\u201cbackground level,\\u201c called the cosmic background is 0.0000000001 \\u2013 0.000000000000001 \\u00b5W/cm2 (\\u00b5W = microwatt \\u2013 one millionth of a watt). Thus, the higher background limit (first one) is one ten billionth of a millionth of a watt (sounds like just a few electrons to me \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nFCC limit is on the other side of the decimal point at 1000 \\u00b5W/cm2. a thousand millionths of a watt \\u2013 per square centimeter, that is. Frankly, the author\\u2019s head goes into a spin with these minuscule decimals, but it\\u2019s safe to say there\\u2019s a bit of a margin between FCC and Cosmos \\ud83d\\ude42\\n\\nThe FCC limit is outrageous even compared to the most conservative proposed \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d limit: .003 \\u2013 .006 \\u00b5W/cm2. and the BioInitiative Report authors say it might even need to be lower..\\n\\nImportantly, however, the cosmic variety is analog, not artificial, digital, polarized or modulated (pulsed). That means there is a safe, \\u201cbiologically based\\u201d exposure limit after all: zero.\\n\\n\\u201cNot technically feasible\\u201d? Well, of course. Technology is more important than health in some minds. \\u201cReasonable risk-benefit\\u201d? The Summary doesn\\u2019t say how many sick or dead per million is reasonable. (Please see also)\\n\\nOne wonders if they were aware of earlier studies, referred to by Andrew Michrowski, PhD at the 2009 Toronto Whole Life Expo (see section, Key Testimony in Toronto in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMichrowski interprets the data for us: \\u201cAnalysis of 1950 -1974 mortality of 40,000 Korean War veterans shows that microwave exposure effect is cumulative [emphasis added] it affects all deaths \\u2026 doubling to tripling cancers of eye, brain and central nervous system, lymphatic and hematopoietic [blood-cell/platelet-forming] and digestive systems. This means that even \\u2018weak\\u2019 and short exposures from wireless systems accumulate over the years and decades to engender serious diseases\\u201d (can\\u2019t be said too often).\\n\\nNor do we know if the Warsaw International Symposium or its WHO reviewers were aware that the US military and others conducted microwave stealth-weapon research in the 1950s. This technology became 2G. See Sections Assault: From Weapon to Telecom and Ultimate Atrocity in the Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nOpposition warnings frequently emphasize \\u2018protecting you and your family.\\u2019 The point having been made several times is worth repeating: The most dire threat is to the ecosystem, not humans. No exposed living thing is immune.\\n\\nEnvironment usually suffers in the background of hysteria. One will see lists something like this: \\u201chealth, privacy, security, and the environment.\\u201d\\n\\nThose who offer exposure \\u201csolutions\\u201d or \\u201ctips\\u201d seem to forget that no form or amount of human protection does so for Nature. A false sense of security in being \\u201csafer\\u201d leads to continued use and support of the overall system, immeasurably intensifying that threat.\\n\\nInsects, for example, are highly susceptible to telecom/WiFi microwave, especially to MMW, which we haven\\u2019t even had yet. In the last quarter century or so, coinciding closely with the introduction of 2G, 75% of the biomass of insects has disappeared in otherwise protected areas in Germany. Meaning it\\u2019s probably worse where other threats co-exist.\\n\\nEmphatically: The wireless threat to planet isn\\u2019t just about radiation, but about the entire process involved in creating it. We need to look at the context of wireless, which is technology, per se. And one thing is certain about most of that, regardless of benefit \\u2013 its toxic.\\n\\nIn almost all cases, somewhere along the line from resource acquisition (especially mining) to manufacture, use, and disposal, advanced technology is chemically/energetically toxic to planet and biosphere. Wireless encompasses the entire line of a process of Earth liquidation/sacrifice for human \\u201cneeds\\u201d \\u2013 money, convenience, and entertainment (see section The Price of Techno-Civilization in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nMoving to \\u201cwired\\u201d telecom/WiFi will not stop this assault. Countries are under siege for resources. Nor will the Elite psyops \\u201cSustainable Development\\u201d and \\u201cClean Renewable Energy\\u201d stop it. But that\\u2019s another article.\\n\\nThe attitude revealed in the WHO document about safety \\u2013 \\u201cnot technically feasible\\u201d \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t changed. I ask that anyone who can name a major environmental or health crisis in which technology isn\\u2019t the cause or doesn\\u2019t play a major role, comment about it.\\n\\nLooking at the overall output of \\u201cconcerned\\u201d EMF scientists and activists, however, if one isn\\u2019t careful, one could conclude it\\u2019s thought that humans can do quite well without the planet.\\n\\nAnother major concern is disproportionate attention on local antennas, while a massive satellite program proceeds. At one point, up to 20,000 satellites were planned to blanket the globe. But the number keeps growing.\\n\\nMadman Elon Musk\\u2019s SpaceX had dibs on 12,000 for 5Gmmw. Here is news that Madman is applying for 30,000 more. Just 42,000 satellites will be about 5 times the total spacecraft launched since 1957 (8,500).\\n\\nSeveral other companies, including Boeing, OneWeb, Amazon, Facebook, not to mention Russia and China, mean many thousands more. Total madness could bring it to somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000. This considered sane. Why? Because insanity unrecognized as such has become the norm in the culture of toxic-technomasturbation.\\n\\nPollution. Some 150 tons of refined kerosene and 340 tons of liquid oxygen per Musk 5G launch (60 satellites, 400 kg each). Do the math, even for 12,000. There seems to be no concern for consequences, such as potential damage to the ozone layer, major interference with earth\\u2019s energy field, or even increased atmospheric CO2 (for the faithful). Not to mention, decline of breathable free oxygen (very cool dynamic graph).\\n\\nMuch seems to be up in the air on the satellite program. Since launches proceed in haste, the plan seems to be shoot them up first, answer proprietary questions later, dismissing anyone else\\u2019s. In Europe, there are currently calls for papers on satellite integration with 5G, with submissions deadline being the Ides of March 2020.\\n\\nNASA, NOAA, meteorologists, (and radio astronomers) have issued valid concerns about MMW. FCC has dismissed them, too. Yet, NASA intends to participate in this bit of insanity.\\n\\nMight such arrogance indicate a certain level of supra-CorporateGovernmental power from which this atrocity originates? Insane is a good word for it, but psychopathic puts a more specific tag on it. See subsections Same Old Story\\u2026 and \\u2026with a Twist in Wireless Technology: \\u2026\\n\\nThe best way to beat 5G, on the ground at least, is to quit wireless tech flat. Little demand \\u2018down here\\u2019 could greatly reduce incentive to invest \\u2018up there\\u2019. If there is a total-surveillance and human-control system gestating in the technosphere, how much of a role could satellites play?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strongly suggested that an outcry on satellites \\u2013 and drones, for that matter \\u2013 should drown out the one on earthbound antennas.\\n\\nTaking into account what physics and biophysics suggest about power levels and biosensitivity respectively; and what the WHO document (and other historical documents) report about effects and safe level; what\\u2019s known about unnoticed effects accumulating over time in living systems; and the fact that environment and humans have been exposed for almost 3 decades now, does anyone feel that 2G-4G wireless isn\\u2019t, of itself, a quite sufficient terminal nightmare?\\n\\nAgain, a race is on between ecosystem collapse and human health collapse. Allowing classic 4G (or even just 5G FR1) to continue potentiates imminent disaster. Both scenarios are in progress, but at the \\u2018deniable\\u2019 stage. When \\u2018undeniable\\u2019 sets in, the slope will almost certainly have become too steep and slippery.\\n\\nExperience shows that science-based appeals, to governments at all levels; to national and international regulatory bodies, and so on is an exercise in futility due to multiple factors, including corruption, disbelief, and intimidation. Old and chronic conditions.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s in the People\\u2019s hands now, at the commercial level. Either common sense prevails over addiction and selfishness, or we wait for the race to end and hope it\\u2019s not too late.\\n\\nGive up wireless per se or give up the future \\u2013 liberty first, then life. If not, then welcome all 5G, especially the satellites. Surrender to it will mercifully shorten the coming agony.\\n\\nPeter Tocci is a retired massage therapist and wellness consultant with an abiding interest in exploring \\u2018managed\\u2019 history, nefarious covert agendas, and mainstream/mainstream-alternative news-media dereliction, distortion and suppression.

The U.S. government.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve been losing our freedoms so incrementally for so long\\u2014sold to us in the name of national security and global peace, maintained by way of martial law disguised as law and order, and enforced by a standing army of militarized police and a political elite determined to maintain their powers at all costs\\u2014that it\\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when it all started going downhill, but we\\u2019re certainly on that downward trajectory now, and things are moving fast.\\n\\nThe Deep State\\u2019s plot to take over America has succeeded.\\n\\nThe American system of representative government has been overthrown by a profit-driven, militaristic, corporate oligarchy bent on total control and global domination through the imposition of martial law here at home and by fomenting wars abroad.\\n\\nEven now, we are being pushed and prodded towards a civil war, not because the American people are so divided but because that\\u2019s how corrupt governments control a populace (i.e., divide and conquer).\\n\\nThese are indeed dangerous times but not because of violent crime, which remains at an all-time low, or because of terrorism, which is statistically rare, or because the borders are being invaded by foreign armies, which data reports from the Department of Homeland Security refute.\\n\\nNo, the real danger that we face comes from none other than the U.S. government and the powers it has granted to its standing armies to rob, steal, cheat, harass, detain, brutalize, terrorize, torture and kill American citizens with immunity.\\n\\nThe danger \\u201cwe the people\\u201d face comes from masked invaders on the government payroll who crash through our doors in the dark of night, shoot our dogs, and terrorize our families.\\n\\nThis danger comes from militarized henchmen on the government payroll who demand absolute obedience, instill abject fear, and shoot first and ask questions later.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy, power-hungry bureaucrats on the government payroll who have little to no understanding of their constitutional limits.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy politicians and corporations for whom profit trumps principle.\\n\\nYou want to know about the state of our union? It\\u2019s downright scary.\\n\\nConsider, if you will, all of the dastardly, devious, diabolical, dangerous, debilitating, deceitful, dehumanizing, demonic, depraved, dishonorable, disillusioning, discriminatory, dictatorial schemes inflicted on \\u201cwe the people\\u201d by a bureaucratic, totalitarian regime that has long since ceased to be \\u201ca government of the people, by the people and for the people.\\u201d\\n\\nAmericans have no protection against police abuse. It is no longer unusual to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals first and ask questions later, such as the 16-year-old teenager who skipped school only to be shot by police after they mistook him for a fleeing burglar. Then there was the unarmed black man in Texas \\u201cwho was pursued and shot in the back of the neck by Austin Police\\u2026 after failing to properly identify himself and leaving the scene of an unrelated incident.\\u201d And who could forget the 19-year-old Seattle woman who was accidentally shot in the leg by police after she refused to show her hands? What is increasingly common, however, is the news that the officers involved in these incidents get off with little more than a slap on the hands.\\n\\nAmericans are little more than pocketbooks to fund the police state. If there is any absolute maxim by which the federal government seems to operate, it is that the American taxpayer always gets ripped off. This is true, whether you\\u2019re talking about taxpayers being forced to fund high-priced weaponry that will be used against us, endless wars that do little for our safety or our freedoms, or bloated government agencies such as the National Security Agency with its secret budgets, covert agendas and clandestine activities. Rubbing salt in the wound, even monetary awards in lawsuits against government officials who are found guilty of wrongdoing are paid by the taxpayer.\\n\\nAmericans are no longer innocent until proven guilty. We once operated under the assumption that you were innocent until proven guilty. Due in large part to rapid advances in technology and a heightened surveillance culture, the burden of proof has been shifted so that the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty has been usurped by a new norm in which all citizens are suspects. This is exemplified by police practices of stopping and frisking people who are merely walking down the street and where there is no evidence of wrongdoing. Likewise, by subjecting Americans to full-body scans and license-plate readers without their knowledge or compliance and then storing the scans for later use, the government\\u2014in cahoots with the corporate state\\u2014has erected the ultimate suspect society. In such an environment, we are all potentially guilty of some wrongdoing or other.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to self-defense. In the wake of various shootings in recent years, \\u201cgun control\\u201d has become a resounding theme. Those advocating gun reform see the Second Amendment\\u2019s right to bear arms as applying only to government officials. As a result, even Americans who legally own firearms are being treated with suspicion and, in some cases, undue violence. In one case, a Texas man had his home subjected to a no-knock raid and was shot in his bed after police, attempting to deliver a routine search warrant, learned that he was in legal possession of a firearm. In another incident, a Florida man who was licensed to carry a concealed firearm found himself detained for two hours during a routine traffic stop in Maryland while the arresting officer searched his vehicle in vain for the man\\u2019s gun, which he had left at home. Incidentally, the Trump Administration has done more to crack down on Second Amendment rights than anything the Obama Administration ever managed.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to private property. If government agents can invade your home, break down your doors, kill your dog, damage your furnishings and terrorize your family, your property is no longer private and secure\\u2014it belongs to the government. Likewise, if government officials can fine and arrest you for growing vegetables in your front yard, praying with friends in your living room, installing solar panels on your roof, and raising chickens in your backyard, you\\u2019re no longer the owner of your property.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a say about what their children are exposed to in school. Incredibly, the government continues to insist that parents essentially forfeit their rights when they send their children to a public school. This growing tension over whether young people, especially those in the public schools, are essentially wards of the state, to do with as government officials deem appropriate, in defiance of the children\\u2019s constitutional rights and those of their parents, is reflected in the debate over sex education programs that expose young people to all manner of sexual practices and terminology, zero tolerance policies that strip students of any due process rights, let alone parental involvement in school discipline, and Common Core programs that teach students to be test-takers rather than critical thinkers.\\n\\nAmericans are powerless in the face of militarized police. In early America, citizens were considered equals with law enforcement officials. Authorities were rarely permitted to enter one\\u2019s home without permission or in a deceitful manner. And it was not uncommon for police officers to be held personally liable for trespass when they wrongfully invaded a citizen\\u2019s home. Unlike today, early Americans could resist arrest when a police officer tried to restrain them without proper justification or a warrant\\u2014which the police had to allow citizens to read before arresting them. (Daring to dispute a warrant with a police official today who is armed with high-tech military weapons and tasers would be nothing short of suicidal.) As police forces across the country continue to be transformed into outposts of the military, with police agencies acquiring military-grade hardware in droves, Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts, complete with tanks, weaponry, and other equipment designed for the battlefield.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to bodily integrity. Court rulings undermining the Fourth Amendment and justifying invasive strip searches have left us powerless against police empowered to forcefully draw our blood, strip search us, and probe us intimately. Accounts are on the rise of individuals\\u2014men and women\\u2014being subjected to what is essentially government-sanctioned rape by police in the course of \\u201croutine\\u201d traffic stops. Remember the New Mexico man who was subjected to a 12-hour ordeal of anal probes, X-rays, enemas, and finally a colonoscopy\\u2014all because he allegedly rolled through a stop sign?\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to the expectation of privacy. Despite the staggering number of revelations about government spying on Americans\\u2019 phone calls, Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, Google searches, emails, bookstore and grocery purchases, bank statements, commuter toll records, etc., Congress, the president and the courts have done little to nothing to counteract these abuses. Instead, they seem determined to accustom us to life in this electronic concentration camp.\\n\\nAmericans can no longer rely on the courts to mete out justice. The U.S. Supreme Court was intended to be an institution established to intervene and protect the people against the government and its agents when they overstep their bounds. Yet through their deference to police power, preference for security over freedom, and evisceration of our most basic rights for the sake of order and expediency, the justices of the Supreme Court have become the architects of the American police state in which we now live, while the lower courts have appointed themselves courts of order, concerned primarily with advancing the government\\u2019s agenda, no matter how unjust or illegal.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a representative government. We have moved beyond the era of representative government and entered a new age, let\\u2019s call it the age of authoritarianism. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called \\u201ceconomic elite.\\u201d Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. It is not overstating matters to say that Congress, which has done its best to keep their unhappy constituents at a distance, may well be the most self-serving, semi-corrupt institution in America.\\n\\nIn other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism: a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. Rest assured that when and if fascism finally takes hold in America, the basic forms of government will remain: Fascism will appear to be friendly. The legislators will be in session. There will be elections, and the news media will continue to cover the entertainment and political trivia. Consent of the governed, however, will no longer apply. Actual control will have finally passed to the oligarchic elite controlling the government behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Clearly, we are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests. We have moved into \\u201ccorporatism\\u201d (favored by Benito Mussolini), which is a halfway point on the road to full-blown fascism. Corporatism is where the few moneyed interests\\u2014not elected by the citizenry\\u2014rule over the many.\\n\\nHistory may show that from this point forward, we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a totalitarian state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom. Even with its constantly shifting terrain, this topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America\\u2019s new normal. From Clinton to Bush, then Obama and now Trump, it\\u2019s as if we\\u2019ve been caught in a time loop, forced to re-live the same thing over and over again: the same assaults on our freedoms, the same disregard for the rule of law, the same subservience to the Deep State, and the same corrupt, self-serving government that exists only to amass power, enrich its shareholders and ensure its continued domination.\\n\\nElections will not save us.\\n\\nI haven\\u2019t even touched on the corporate state, the military industrial complex, SWAT team raids, invasive surveillance technology, zero tolerance policies in the schools, overcriminalization, or privatized prisons, to name just a few, but what I have touched on should be enough to show that the landscape of our freedoms has already changed dramatically from what it once was and will no doubt continue to deteriorate unless Americans can find a way to wrest back control of their government and reclaim their freedoms.\\n\\nThere can be no denying that the world is indeed a dangerous place, but what the president and his cohorts fail to acknowledge is that it\\u2019s the government that poses the gravest threat to our freedoms and way of life, and no amount of politicking, parsing or pandering will change that.\\n\\nIt is easy to be diverted, distracted and amused by the antics of politicians, the pomp and circumstance of awards shows, athletic events, and entertainment news, and the feel-good, wrapped-in-the-flag evangelism that passes for religion today.\\n\\nWhat is far more difficult to face up to is the reality of life in America, where unemployment, poverty, inequality, injustice and violence by government agents are increasingly norms, and where \\u201cwe the people\\u201d are at a distinct disadvantage in the face of the government elite\\u2019s power grabs, greed and firepower.\\n\\nThe Constitution doesn\\u2019t stand a chance against a federalized, globalized standing army protected by legislative, judicial and executive branches that are all on the same side, no matter what political views they subscribe to: suffice it to say, they are not on our side or the side of freedom.\\n\\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the powers-that-be want us to remain distracted, divided, alienated from each other based on our politics, our bank accounts, our religion, our race and our value systems. Yet as George Orwell observed, \\u201cThe real division is not between conservatives and revolutionaries but between authoritarians and libertarians.\\u201d\\n\\nYou either believe in freedom or you don\\u2019t.

What is increasingly common, however, is the news that the officers involved in these incidents get off with little more than a slap on the hands.\\n\\nAmericans are little more than pocketbooks to fund the police state. If there is any absolute maxim by which the federal government seems to operate, it is that the American taxpayer always gets ripped off. This is true, whether you\\u2019re talking about taxpayers being forced to fund high-priced weaponry that will be used against us, endless wars that do little for our safety or our freedoms, or bloated government agencies such as the National Security Agency with its secret budgets, covert agendas and clandestine activities.

As a result, even Americans who legally own firearms are being treated with suspicion and, in some cases, undue violence. In one case, a Texas man had his home subjected to a no-knock raid and was shot in his bed after police, attempting to deliver a routine search warrant, learned that he was in legal possession of a firearm. In another incident, a Florida man who was licensed to carry a concealed firearm found himself detained for two hours during a routine traffic stop in Maryland while the arresting officer searched his vehicle in vain for the man\\u2019s gun, which he had left at home. Incidentally, the Trump Administration has done more to crack down on Second Amendment rights than anything the Obama Administration ever managed.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to private property. If government agents can invade your home, break down your doors, kill your dog, damage your furnishings and terrorize your family, your property is no longer private and secure\\u2014it belongs to the government. Likewise, if government officials can fine and arrest you for growing vegetables in your front yard, praying with friends in your living room, installing solar panels on your roof, and raising chickens in your backyard, you\\u2019re no longer the owner of your property.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a say about what their children are exposed to in school. Incredibly, the government continues to insist that parents essentially forfeit their rights when they send their children to a public school. This growing tension over whether young people, especially those in the public schools, are essentially wards of the state, to do with as government officials deem appropriate, in defiance of the children\\u2019s constitutional rights and those of their parents, is reflected in the debate over sex education programs that expose young people to all manner of sexual practices and terminology, zero tolerance policies that strip students of any due process rights, let alone parental involvement in school discipline, and Common Core programs that teach students to be test-takers rather than critical thinkers.\\n\\nAmericans are powerless in the face of militarized police. In early America, citizens were considered equals with law enforcement officials. Authorities were rarely permitted to enter one\\u2019s home without permission or in a deceitful manner. And it was not uncommon for police officers to be held personally liable for trespass when they wrongfully invaded a citizen\\u2019s home. Unlike today, early Americans could resist arrest when a police officer tried to restrain them without proper justification or a warrant\\u2014which the police had to allow citizens to read before arresting them. (Daring to dispute a warrant with a police official today who is armed with high-tech military weapons and tasers would be nothing short of suicidal.) As police forces across the country continue to be transformed into outposts of the military, with police agencies acquiring military-grade hardware in droves, Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts, complete with tanks, weaponry, and other equipment designed for the battlefield.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to bodily integrity. Court rulings undermining the Fourth Amendment and justifying invasive strip searches have left us powerless against police empowered to forcefully draw our blood, strip search us, and probe us intimately. Accounts are on the rise of individuals\\u2014men and women\\u2014being subjected to what is essentially government-sanctioned rape by police in the course of \\u201croutine\\u201d traffic stops. Remember the New Mexico man who was subjected to a 12-hour ordeal of anal probes, X-rays, enemas, and finally a colonoscopy\\u2014all because he allegedly rolled through a stop sign?\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to the expectation of privacy. Despite the staggering number of revelations about government spying on Americans\\u2019 phone calls, Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, Google searches, emails, bookstore and grocery purchases, bank statements, commuter toll records, etc., Congress, the president and the courts have done little to nothing to counteract these abuses. Instead, they seem determined to accustom us to life in this electronic concentration camp.\\n\\nAmericans can no longer rely on the courts to mete out justice. The U.S. Supreme Court was intended to be an institution established to intervene and protect the people against the government and its agents when they overstep their bounds. Yet through their deference to police power, preference for security over freedom, and evisceration of our most basic rights for the sake of order and expediency, the justices of the Supreme Court have become the architects of the American police state in which we now live, while the lower courts have appointed themselves courts of order, concerned primarily with advancing the government\\u2019s agenda, no matter how unjust or illegal.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a representative government. We have moved beyond the era of representative government and entered a new age, let\\u2019s call it the age of authoritarianism. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called \\u201ceconomic elite.\\u201d Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. It is not overstating matters to say that Congress, which has done its best to keep their unhappy constituents at a distance, may well be the most self-serving, semi-corrupt institution in America.\\n\\nIn other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism: a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. Rest assured that when and if fascism finally takes hold in America, the basic forms of government will remain: Fascism will appear to be friendly. The legislators will be in session. There will be elections, and the news media will continue to cover the entertainment and political trivia. Consent of the governed, however, will no longer apply. Actual control will have finally passed to the oligarchic elite controlling the government behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Clearly, we are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests. We have moved into \\u201ccorporatism\\u201d (favored by Benito Mussolini), which is a halfway point on the road to full-blown fascism. Corporatism is where the few moneyed interests\\u2014not elected by the citizenry\\u2014rule over the many.\\n\\nHistory may show that from this point forward, we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a totalitarian state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom. Even with its constantly shifting terrain, this topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America\\u2019s new normal. From Clinton to Bush, then Obama and now Trump, it\\u2019s as if we\\u2019ve been caught in a time loop, forced to re-live the same thing over and over again: the same assaults on our freedoms, the same disregard for the rule of law, the same subservience to the Deep State, and the same corrupt, self-serving government that exists only to amass power, enrich its shareholders and ensure its continued domination.\\n\\nElections will not save us.\\n\\nI haven\\u2019t even touched on the corporate state, the military industrial complex, SWAT team raids, invasive surveillance technology, zero tolerance policies in the schools, overcriminalization, or privatized prisons, to name just a few, but what I have touched on should be enough to show that the landscape of our freedoms has already changed dramatically from what it once was and will no doubt continue to deteriorate unless Americans can find a way to wrest back control of their government and reclaim their freedoms.\\n\\nThere can be no denying that the world is indeed a dangerous place, but what the president and his cohorts fail to acknowledge is that it\\u2019s the government that poses the gravest threat to our freedoms and way of life, and no amount of politicking, parsing or pandering will change that.\\n\\nIt is easy to be diverted, distracted and amused by the antics of politicians, the pomp and circumstance of awards shows, athletic events, and entertainment news, and the feel-good, wrapped-in-the-flag evangelism that passes for religion today.\\n\\nWhat is far more difficult to face up to is the reality of life in America, where unemployment, poverty, inequality, injustice and violence by government agents are increasingly norms, and where \\u201cwe the people\\u201d are at a distinct disadvantage in the face of the government elite\\u2019s power grabs, greed and firepower.\\n\\nThe Constitution doesn\\u2019t stand a chance against a federalized, globalized standing army protected by legislative, judicial and executive branches that are all on the same side, no matter what political views they subscribe to: suffice it to say, they are not on our side or the side of freedom.\\n\\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the powers-that-be want us to remain distracted, divided, alienated from each other based on our politics, our bank accounts, our religion, our race and our value systems. Yet as George Orwell observed, \\u201cThe real division is not between conservatives and revolutionaries but between authoritarians and libertarians.\\u201d\\n\\nYou either believe in freedom or you don\\u2019t.

It is no longer unusual to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals first and ask questions later, such as the 16-year-old teenager who skipped school only to be shot by police after they mistook him for a fleeing burglar.

What is increasingly common, however, is the news that the officers involved in these incidents get off with little more than a slap on the hands.\\n\\nAmericans are little more than pocketbooks to fund the police state. If there is any absolute maxim by which the federal government seems to operate, it is that the American taxpayer always gets ripped off. This is true, whether you\\u2019re talking about taxpayers being forced to fund high-priced weaponry that will be used against us, endless wars that do little for our safety or our freedoms, or bloated government agencies such as the National Security Agency with its secret budgets, covert agendas and clandestine activities. Rubbing salt in the wound, even monetary awards in lawsuits against government officials who are found guilty of wrongdoing are paid by the taxpayer.\\n\\nAmericans are no longer innocent until proven guilty. We once operated under the assumption that you were innocent until proven guilty. Due in large part to rapid advances in technology and a heightened surveillance culture, the burden of proof has been shifted so that the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty has been usurped by a new norm in which all citizens are suspects. This is exemplified by police practices of stopping and frisking people who are merely walking down the street and where there is no evidence of wrongdoing. Likewise, by subjecting Americans to full-body scans and license-plate readers without their knowledge or compliance and then storing the scans for later use, the government\\u2014in cahoots with the corporate state\\u2014has erected the ultimate suspect society.

If government agents can invade your home, break down your doors, kill your dog, damage your furnishings and terrorize your family, your property is no longer private and secure\\u2014it belongs to the government. Likewise, if government officials can fine and arrest you for growing vegetables in your front yard, praying with friends in your living room, installing solar panels on your roof, and raising chickens in your backyard, you\\u2019re no longer the owner of your property.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a say about what their children are exposed to in school. Incredibly, the government continues to insist that parents essentially forfeit their rights when they send their children to a public school. This growing tension over whether young people, especially those in the public schools, are essentially wards of the state, to do with as government officials deem appropriate, in defiance of the children\\u2019s constitutional rights and those of their parents, is reflected in the debate over sex education programs that expose young people to all manner of sexual practices and terminology, zero tolerance policies that strip students of any due process rights, let alone parental involvement in school discipline, and Common Core programs that teach students to be test-takers rather than critical thinkers.\\n\\nAmericans are powerless in the face of militarized police. In early America, citizens were considered equals with law enforcement officials. Authorities were rarely permitted to enter one\\u2019s home without permission or in a deceitful manner. And it was not uncommon for police officers to be held personally liable for trespass when they wrongfully invaded a citizen\\u2019s home. Unlike today, early Americans could resist arrest when a police officer tried to restrain them without proper justification or a warrant\\u2014which the police had to allow citizens to read before arresting them. (Daring to dispute a warrant with a police official today who is armed with high-tech military weapons and tasers would be nothing short of suicidal.) As police forces across the country continue to be transformed into outposts of the military, with police agencies acquiring military-grade hardware in droves, Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts, complete with tanks, weaponry, and other equipment designed for the battlefield.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to bodily integrity. Court rulings undermining the Fourth Amendment and justifying invasive strip searches have left us powerless against police empowered to forcefully draw our blood, strip search us, and probe us intimately. Accounts are on the rise of individuals\\u2014men and women\\u2014being subjected to what is essentially government-sanctioned rape by police in the course of \\u201croutine\\u201d traffic stops. Remember the New Mexico man who was subjected to a 12-hour ordeal of anal probes, X-rays, enemas, and finally a colonoscopy\\u2014all because he allegedly rolled through a stop sign?\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to the expectation of privacy. Despite the staggering number of revelations about government spying on Americans\\u2019 phone calls, Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, Google searches, emails, bookstore and grocery purchases, bank statements, commuter toll records, etc., Congress, the president and the courts have done little to nothing to counteract these abuses. Instead, they seem determined to accustom us to life in this electronic concentration camp.\\n\\nAmericans can no longer rely on the courts to mete out justice. The U.S. Supreme Court was intended to be an institution established to intervene and protect the people against the government and its agents when they overstep their bounds. Yet through their deference to police power, preference for security over freedom, and evisceration of our most basic rights for the sake of order and expediency, the justices of the Supreme Court have become the architects of the American police state in which we now live, while the lower courts have appointed themselves courts of order, concerned primarily with advancing the government\\u2019s agenda, no matter how unjust or illegal.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a representative government. We have moved beyond the era of representative government and entered a new age, let\\u2019s call it the age of authoritarianism. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called \\u201ceconomic elite.\\u201d Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. It is not overstating matters to say that Congress, which has done its best to keep their unhappy constituents at a distance, may well be the most self-serving, semi-corrupt institution in America.\\n\\nIn other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism: a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. Rest assured that when and if fascism finally takes hold in America, the basic forms of government will remain: Fascism will appear to be friendly. The legislators will be in session. There will be elections, and the news media will continue to cover the entertainment and political trivia. Consent of the governed, however, will no longer apply. Actual control will have finally passed to the oligarchic elite controlling the government behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Clearly, we are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests. We have moved into \\u201ccorporatism\\u201d (favored by Benito Mussolini), which is a halfway point on the road to full-blown fascism. Corporatism is where the few moneyed interests\\u2014not elected by the citizenry\\u2014rule over the many.\\n\\nHistory may show that from this point forward, we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a totalitarian state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom. Even with its constantly shifting terrain, this topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America\\u2019s new normal. From Clinton to Bush, then Obama and now Trump, it\\u2019s as if we\\u2019ve been caught in a time loop, forced to re-live the same thing over and over again: the same assaults on our freedoms, the same disregard for the rule of law, the same subservience to the Deep State, and the same corrupt, self-serving government that exists only to amass power, enrich its shareholders and ensure its continued domination.\\n\\nElections will not save us.\\n\\nI haven\\u2019t even touched on the corporate state, the military industrial complex, SWAT team raids, invasive surveillance technology, zero tolerance policies in the schools, overcriminalization, or privatized prisons, to name just a few, but what I have touched on should be enough to show that the landscape of our freedoms has already changed dramatically from what it once was and will no doubt continue to deteriorate unless Americans can find a way to wrest back control of their government and reclaim their freedoms.\\n\\nThere can be no denying that the world is indeed a dangerous place, but what the president and his cohorts fail to acknowledge is that it\\u2019s the government that poses the gravest threat to our freedoms and way of life, and no amount of politicking, parsing or pandering will change that.\\n\\nIt is easy to be diverted, distracted and amused by the antics of politicians, the pomp and circumstance of awards shows, athletic events, and entertainment news, and the feel-good, wrapped-in-the-flag evangelism that passes for religion today.\\n\\nWhat is far more difficult to face up to is the reality of life in America, where unemployment, poverty, inequality, injustice and violence by government agents are increasingly norms, and where \\u201cwe the people\\u201d are at a distinct disadvantage in the face of the government elite\\u2019s power grabs, greed and firepower.\\n\\nThe Constitution doesn\\u2019t stand a chance against a federalized, globalized standing army protected by legislative, judicial and executive branches that are all on the same side, no matter what political views they subscribe to: suffice it to say, they are not on our side or the side of freedom.\\n\\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the powers-that-be want us to remain distracted, divided, alienated from each other based on our politics, our bank accounts, our religion, our race and our value systems.

It is no longer unusual to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals first and ask questions later, such as the 16-year-old teenager who skipped school only to be shot by police after they mistook him for a fleeing burglar.

What is increasingly common, however, is the news that the officers involved in these incidents get off with little more than a slap on the hands.\\n\\nAmericans are little more than pocketbooks to fund the police state. If there is any absolute maxim by which the federal government seems to operate, it is that the American taxpayer always gets ripped off. This is true, whether you\\u2019re talking about taxpayers being forced to fund high-priced weaponry that will be used against us, endless wars that do little for our safety or our freedoms, or bloated government agencies such as the National Security Agency with its secret budgets, covert agendas and clandestine activities.

We once operated under the assumption that you were innocent until proven guilty. Due in large part to rapid advances in technology and a heightened surveillance culture, the burden of proof has been shifted so that the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty has been usurped by a new norm in which all citizens are suspects. This is exemplified by police practices of stopping and frisking people who are merely walking down the street and where there is no evidence of wrongdoing. Likewise, by subjecting Americans to full-body scans and license-plate readers without their knowledge or compliance and then storing the scans for later use, the government\\u2014in cahoots with the corporate state\\u2014has erected the ultimate suspect society.

This growing tension over whether young people, especially those in the public schools, are essentially wards of the state, to do with as government officials deem appropriate, in defiance of the children\\u2019s constitutional rights and those of their parents, is reflected in the debate over sex education programs that expose young people to all manner of sexual practices and terminology, zero tolerance policies that strip students of any due process rights, let alone parental involvement in school discipline, and Common Core programs that teach students to be test-takers rather than critical thinkers.\\n\\nAmericans are powerless in the face of militarized police. In early America, citizens were considered equals with law enforcement officials. Authorities were rarely permitted to enter one\\u2019s home without permission or in a deceitful manner. And it was not uncommon for police officers to be held personally liable for trespass when they wrongfully invaded a citizen\\u2019s home. Unlike today, early Americans could resist arrest when a police officer tried to restrain them without proper justification or a warrant\\u2014which the police had to allow citizens to read before arresting them. (Daring to dispute a warrant with a police official today who is armed with high-tech military weapons and tasers would be nothing short of suicidal.) As police forces across the country continue to be transformed into outposts of the military, with police agencies acquiring military-grade hardware in droves, Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts, complete with tanks, weaponry, and other equipment designed for the battlefield.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to bodily integrity. Court rulings undermining the Fourth Amendment and justifying invasive strip searches have left us powerless against police empowered to forcefully draw our blood, strip search us, and probe us intimately. Accounts are on the rise of individuals\\u2014men and women\\u2014being subjected to what is essentially government-sanctioned rape by police in the course of \\u201croutine\\u201d traffic stops. Remember the New Mexico man who was subjected to a 12-hour ordeal of anal probes, X-rays, enemas, and finally a colonoscopy\\u2014all because he allegedly rolled through a stop sign?\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to the expectation of privacy. Despite the staggering number of revelations about government spying on Americans\\u2019 phone calls, Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, Google searches, emails, bookstore and grocery purchases, bank statements, commuter toll records, etc., Congress, the president and the courts have done little to nothing to counteract these abuses. Instead, they seem determined to accustom us to life in this electronic concentration camp.\\n\\nAmericans can no longer rely on the courts to mete out justice. The U.S. Supreme Court was intended to be an institution established to intervene and protect the people against the government and its agents when they overstep their bounds. Yet through their deference to police power, preference for security over freedom, and evisceration of our most basic rights for the sake of order and expediency, the justices of the Supreme Court have become the architects of the American police state in which we now live, while the lower courts have appointed themselves courts of order, concerned primarily with advancing the government\\u2019s agenda, no matter how unjust or illegal.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a representative government. We have moved beyond the era of representative government and entered a new age, let\\u2019s call it the age of authoritarianism. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called \\u201ceconomic elite.\\u201d Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. It is not overstating matters to say that Congress, which has done its best to keep their unhappy constituents at a distance, may well be the most self-serving, semi-corrupt institution in America.\\n\\nIn other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism: a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. Rest assured that when and if fascism finally takes hold in America, the basic forms of government will remain: Fascism will appear to be friendly. The legislators will be in session. There will be elections, and the news media will continue to cover the entertainment and political trivia. Consent of the governed, however, will no longer apply. Actual control will have finally passed to the oligarchic elite controlling the government behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Clearly, we are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests. We have moved into \\u201ccorporatism\\u201d (favored by Benito Mussolini), which is a halfway point on the road to full-blown fascism. Corporatism is where the few moneyed interests\\u2014not elected by the citizenry\\u2014rule over the many.\\n\\nHistory may show that from this point forward, we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a totalitarian state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom. Even with its constantly shifting terrain, this topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America\\u2019s new normal. From Clinton to Bush, then Obama and now Trump, it\\u2019s as if we\\u2019ve been caught in a time loop, forced to re-live the same thing over and over again: the same assaults on our freedoms, the same disregard for the rule of law, the same subservience to the Deep State, and the same corrupt, self-serving government that exists only to amass power, enrich its shareholders and ensure its continued domination.\\n\\nElections will not save us.\\n\\nI haven\\u2019t even touched on the corporate state, the military industrial complex, SWAT team raids, invasive surveillance technology, zero tolerance policies in the schools, overcriminalization, or privatized prisons, to name just a few, but what I have touched on should be enough to show that the landscape of our freedoms has already changed dramatically from what it once was and will no doubt continue to deteriorate unless Americans can find a way to wrest back control of their government and reclaim their freedoms.\\n\\nThere can be no denying that the world is indeed a dangerous place, but what the president and his cohorts fail to acknowledge is that it\\u2019s the government that poses the gravest threat to our freedoms and way of life, and no amount of politicking, parsing or pandering will change that.\\n\\nIt is easy to be diverted, distracted and amused by the antics of politicians, the pomp and circumstance of awards shows, athletic events, and entertainment news, and the feel-good, wrapped-in-the-flag evangelism that passes for religion today.\\n\\nWhat is far more difficult to face up to is the reality of life in America, where unemployment, poverty, inequality, injustice and violence by government agents are increasingly norms, and where \\u201cwe the people\\u201d are at a distinct disadvantage in the face of the government elite\\u2019s power grabs, greed and firepower.\\n\\nThe Constitution doesn\\u2019t stand a chance against a federalized, globalized standing army protected by legislative, judicial and executive branches that are all on the same side, no matter what political views they subscribe to: suffice it to say, they are not on our side or the side of freedom.\\n\\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the powers-that-be want us to remain distracted, divided, alienated from each other based on our politics, our bank accounts, our religion, our race and our value systems.

The U.S. government.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve been losing our freedoms so incrementally for so long\\u2014sold to us in the name of national security and global peace, maintained by way of martial law disguised as law and order, and enforced by a standing army of militarized police and a political elite determined to maintain their powers at all costs\\u2014that it\\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when it all started going downhill, but we\\u2019re certainly on that downward trajectory now, and things are moving fast.\\n\\nThe Deep State\\u2019s plot to take over America has succeeded.\\n\\nThe American system of representative government has been overthrown by a profit-driven, militaristic, corporate oligarchy bent on total control and global domination through the imposition of martial law here at home and by fomenting wars abroad.\\n\\nEven now, we are being pushed and prodded towards a civil war, not because the American people are so divided but because that\\u2019s how corrupt governments control a populace (i.e., divide and conquer).\\n\\nThese are indeed dangerous times but not because of violent crime, which remains at an all-time low, or because of terrorism, which is statistically rare, or because the borders are being invaded by foreign armies, which data reports from the Department of Homeland Security refute.\\n\\nNo, the real danger that we face comes from none other than the U.S. government and the powers it has granted to its standing armies to rob, steal, cheat, harass, detain, brutalize, terrorize, torture and kill American citizens with immunity.\\n\\nThe danger \\u201cwe the people\\u201d face comes from masked invaders on the government payroll who crash through our doors in the dark of night, shoot our dogs, and terrorize our families.\\n\\nThis danger comes from militarized henchmen on the government payroll who demand absolute obedience, instill abject fear, and shoot first and ask questions later.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy, power-hungry bureaucrats on the government payroll who have little to no understanding of their constitutional limits.\\n\\nThis danger comes from greedy politicians and corporations for whom profit trumps principle.\\n\\nYou want to know about the state of our union? It\\u2019s downright scary.\\n\\nConsider, if you will, all of the dastardly, devious, diabolical, dangerous, debilitating, deceitful, dehumanizing, demonic, depraved, dishonorable, disillusioning, discriminatory, dictatorial schemes inflicted on \\u201cwe the people\\u201d by a bureaucratic, totalitarian regime that has long since ceased to be \\u201ca government of the people, by the people and for the people.\\u201d\\n\\nAmericans have no protection against police abuse. It is no longer unusual to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals first and ask questions later, such as the 16-year-old teenager who skipped school only to be shot by police after they mistook him for a fleeing burglar. Then there was the unarmed black man in Texas \\u201cwho was pursued and shot in the back of the neck by Austin Police\\u2026 after failing to properly identify himself and leaving the scene of an unrelated incident.\\u201d And who could forget the 19-year-old Seattle woman who was accidentally shot in the leg by police after she refused to show her hands? What is increasingly common, however, is the news that the officers involved in these incidents get off with little more than a slap on the hands.\\n\\nAmericans are little more than pocketbooks to fund the police state. If there is any absolute maxim by which the federal government seems to operate, it is that the American taxpayer always gets ripped off. This is true, whether you\\u2019re talking about taxpayers being forced to fund high-priced weaponry that will be used against us, endless wars that do little for our safety or our freedoms, or bloated government agencies such as the National Security Agency with its secret budgets, covert agendas and clandestine activities. Rubbing salt in the wound, even monetary awards in lawsuits against government officials who are found guilty of wrongdoing are paid by the taxpayer.\\n\\nAmericans are no longer innocent until proven guilty. We once operated under the assumption that you were innocent until proven guilty. Due in large part to rapid advances in technology and a heightened surveillance culture, the burden of proof has been shifted so that the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty has been usurped by a new norm in which all citizens are suspects. This is exemplified by police practices of stopping and frisking people who are merely walking down the street and where there is no evidence of wrongdoing. Likewise, by subjecting Americans to full-body scans and license-plate readers without their knowledge or compliance and then storing the scans for later use, the government\\u2014in cahoots with the corporate state\\u2014has erected the ultimate suspect society. In such an environment, we are all potentially guilty of some wrongdoing or other.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to self-defense. In the wake of various shootings in recent years, \\u201cgun control\\u201d has become a resounding theme. Those advocating gun reform see the Second Amendment\\u2019s right to bear arms as applying only to government officials. As a result, even Americans who legally own firearms are being treated with suspicion and, in some cases, undue violence. In one case, a Texas man had his home subjected to a no-knock raid and was shot in his bed after police, attempting to deliver a routine search warrant, learned that he was in legal possession of a firearm. In another incident, a Florida man who was licensed to carry a concealed firearm found himself detained for two hours during a routine traffic stop in Maryland while the arresting officer searched his vehicle in vain for the man\\u2019s gun, which he had left at home. Incidentally, the Trump Administration has done more to crack down on Second Amendment rights than anything the Obama Administration ever managed.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to private property. If government agents can invade your home, break down your doors, kill your dog, damage your furnishings and terrorize your family, your property is no longer private and secure\\u2014it belongs to the government. Likewise, if government officials can fine and arrest you for growing vegetables in your front yard, praying with friends in your living room, installing solar panels on your roof, and raising chickens in your backyard, you\\u2019re no longer the owner of your property.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a say about what their children are exposed to in school.

This growing tension over whether young people, especially those in the public schools, are essentially wards of the state, to do with as government officials deem appropriate, in defiance of the children\\u2019s constitutional rights and those of their parents, is reflected in the debate over sex education programs that expose young people to all manner of sexual practices and terminology, zero tolerance policies that strip students of any due process rights, let alone parental involvement in school discipline, and Common Core programs that teach students to be test-takers rather than critical thinkers.\\n\\nAmericans are powerless in the face of militarized police. In early America, citizens were considered equals with law enforcement officials. Authorities were rarely permitted to enter one\\u2019s home without permission or in a deceitful manner. And it was not uncommon for police officers to be held personally liable for trespass when they wrongfully invaded a citizen\\u2019s home. Unlike today, early Americans could resist arrest when a police officer tried to restrain them without proper justification or a warrant\\u2014which the police had to allow citizens to read before arresting them. (Daring to dispute a warrant with a police official today who is armed with high-tech military weapons and tasers would be nothing short of suicidal.) As police forces across the country continue to be transformed into outposts of the military, with police agencies acquiring military-grade hardware in droves, Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts, complete with tanks, weaponry, and other equipment designed for the battlefield.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to bodily integrity. Court rulings undermining the Fourth Amendment and justifying invasive strip searches have left us powerless against police empowered to forcefully draw our blood, strip search us, and probe us intimately. Accounts are on the rise of individuals\\u2014men and women\\u2014being subjected to what is essentially government-sanctioned rape by police in the course of \\u201croutine\\u201d traffic stops. Remember the New Mexico man who was subjected to a 12-hour ordeal of anal probes, X-rays, enemas, and finally a colonoscopy\\u2014all because he allegedly rolled through a stop sign?\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to the expectation of privacy. Despite the staggering number of revelations about government spying on Americans\\u2019 phone calls, Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, Google searches, emails, bookstore and grocery purchases, bank statements, commuter toll records, etc., Congress, the president and the courts have done little to nothing to counteract these abuses. Instead, they seem determined to accustom us to life in this electronic concentration camp.\\n\\nAmericans can no longer rely on the courts to mete out justice. The U.S. Supreme Court was intended to be an institution established to intervene and protect the people against the government and its agents when they overstep their bounds. Yet through their deference to police power, preference for security over freedom, and evisceration of our most basic rights for the sake of order and expediency, the justices of the Supreme Court have become the architects of the American police state in which we now live, while the lower courts have appointed themselves courts of order, concerned primarily with advancing the government\\u2019s agenda, no matter how unjust or illegal.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a representative government. We have moved beyond the era of representative government and entered a new age, let\\u2019s call it the age of authoritarianism. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called \\u201ceconomic elite.\\u201d Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. It is not overstating matters to say that Congress, which has done its best to keep their unhappy constituents at a distance, may well be the most self-serving, semi-corrupt institution in America.\\n\\nIn other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism: a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. Rest assured that when and if fascism finally takes hold in America, the basic forms of government will remain: Fascism will appear to be friendly. The legislators will be in session. There will be elections, and the news media will continue to cover the entertainment and political trivia. Consent of the governed, however, will no longer apply. Actual control will have finally passed to the oligarchic elite controlling the government behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Clearly, we are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests. We have moved into \\u201ccorporatism\\u201d (favored by Benito Mussolini), which is a halfway point on the road to full-blown fascism. Corporatism is where the few moneyed interests\\u2014not elected by the citizenry\\u2014rule over the many.\\n\\nHistory may show that from this point forward, we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a totalitarian state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom. Even with its constantly shifting terrain, this topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America\\u2019s new normal. From Clinton to Bush, then Obama and now Trump, it\\u2019s as if we\\u2019ve been caught in a time loop, forced to re-live the same thing over and over again: the same assaults on our freedoms, the same disregard for the rule of law, the same subservience to the Deep State, and the same corrupt, self-serving government that exists only to amass power, enrich its shareholders and ensure its continued domination.\\n\\nElections will not save us.\\n\\nI haven\\u2019t even touched on the corporate state, the military industrial complex, SWAT team raids, invasive surveillance technology, zero tolerance policies in the schools, overcriminalization, or privatized prisons, to name just a few, but what I have touched on should be enough to show that the landscape of our freedoms has already changed dramatically from what it once was and will no doubt continue to deteriorate unless Americans can find a way to wrest back control of their government and reclaim their freedoms.\\n\\nThere can be no denying that the world is indeed a dangerous place, but what the president and his cohorts fail to acknowledge is that it\\u2019s the government that poses the gravest threat to our freedoms and way of life, and no amount of politicking, parsing or pandering will change that.\\n\\nIt is easy to be diverted, distracted and amused by the antics of politicians, the pomp and circumstance of awards shows, athletic events, and entertainment news, and the feel-good, wrapped-in-the-flag evangelism that passes for religion today.\\n\\nWhat is far more difficult to face up to is the reality of life in America, where unemployment, poverty, inequality, injustice and violence by government agents are increasingly norms, and where \\u201cwe the people\\u201d are at a distinct disadvantage in the face of the government elite\\u2019s power grabs, greed and firepower.\\n\\nThe Constitution doesn\\u2019t stand a chance against a federalized, globalized standing army protected by legislative, judicial and executive branches that are all on the same side, no matter what political views they subscribe to: suffice it to say, they are not on our side or the side of freedom.\\n\\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the powers-that-be want us to remain distracted, divided, alienated from each other based on our politics, our bank accounts, our religion, our race and our value systems. Yet as George Orwell observed, \\u201cThe real division is not between conservatives and revolutionaries but between authoritarians and libertarians.\\u201d\\n\\nYou either believe in freedom or you don\\u2019t.

It is no longer unusual to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals first and ask questions later, such as the 16-year-old teenager who skipped school only to be shot by police after they mistook him for a fleeing burglar. Then there was the unarmed black man in Texas \\u201cwho was pursued and shot in the back of the neck by Austin Police\\u2026 after failing to properly identify himself and leaving the scene of an unrelated incident.\\u201d And who could forget the 19-year-old Seattle woman who was accidentally shot in the leg by police after she refused to show her hands? What is increasingly common, however, is the news that the officers involved in these incidents get off with little more than a slap on the hands.\\n\\nAmericans are little more than pocketbooks to fund the police state. If there is any absolute maxim by which the federal government seems to operate, it is that the American taxpayer always gets ripped off. This is true, whether you\\u2019re talking about taxpayers being forced to fund high-priced weaponry that will be used against us, endless wars that do little for our safety or our freedoms, or bloated government agencies such as the National Security Agency with its secret budgets, covert agendas and clandestine activities. Rubbing salt in the wound, even monetary awards in lawsuits against government officials who are found guilty of wrongdoing are paid by the taxpayer.\\n\\nAmericans are no longer innocent until proven guilty. We once operated under the assumption that you were innocent until proven guilty. Due in large part to rapid advances in technology and a heightened surveillance culture, the burden of proof has been shifted so that the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty has been usurped by a new norm in which all citizens are suspects. This is exemplified by police practices of stopping and frisking people who are merely walking down the street and where there is no evidence of wrongdoing. Likewise, by subjecting Americans to full-body scans and license-plate readers without their knowledge or compliance and then storing the scans for later use, the government\\u2014in cahoots with the corporate state\\u2014has erected the ultimate suspect society. In such an environment, we are all potentially guilty of some wrongdoing or other.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to self-defense. In the wake of various shootings in recent years, \\u201cgun control\\u201d has become a resounding theme. Those advocating gun reform see the Second Amendment\\u2019s right to bear arms as applying only to government officials. As a result, even Americans who legally own firearms are being treated with suspicion and, in some cases, undue violence. In one case, a Texas man had his home subjected to a no-knock raid and was shot in his bed after police, attempting to deliver a routine search warrant, learned that he was in legal possession of a firearm. In another incident, a Florida man who was licensed to carry a concealed firearm found himself detained for two hours during a routine traffic stop in Maryland while the arresting officer searched his vehicle in vain for the man\\u2019s gun, which he had left at home. Incidentally, the Trump Administration has done more to crack down on Second Amendment rights than anything the Obama Administration ever managed.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to private property. If government agents can invade your home, break down your doors, kill your dog, damage your furnishings and terrorize your family, your property is no longer private and secure\\u2014it belongs to the government.

This growing tension over whether young people, especially those in the public schools, are essentially wards of the state, to do with as government officials deem appropriate, in defiance of the children\\u2019s constitutional rights and those of their parents, is reflected in the debate over sex education programs that expose young people to all manner of sexual practices and terminology, zero tolerance policies that strip students of any due process rights, let alone parental involvement in school discipline, and Common Core programs that teach students to be test-takers rather than critical thinkers.\\n\\nAmericans are powerless in the face of militarized police. In early America, citizens were considered equals with law enforcement officials. Authorities were rarely permitted to enter one\\u2019s home without permission or in a deceitful manner. And it was not uncommon for police officers to be held personally liable for trespass when they wrongfully invaded a citizen\\u2019s home. Unlike today, early Americans could resist arrest when a police officer tried to restrain them without proper justification or a warrant\\u2014which the police had to allow citizens to read before arresting them. (Daring to dispute a warrant with a police official today who is armed with high-tech military weapons and tasers would be nothing short of suicidal.) As police forces across the country continue to be transformed into outposts of the military, with police agencies acquiring military-grade hardware in droves, Americans are finding their once-peaceful communities transformed into military outposts, complete with tanks, weaponry, and other equipment designed for the battlefield.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to bodily integrity. Court rulings undermining the Fourth Amendment and justifying invasive strip searches have left us powerless against police empowered to forcefully draw our blood, strip search us, and probe us intimately. Accounts are on the rise of individuals\\u2014men and women\\u2014being subjected to what is essentially government-sanctioned rape by police in the course of \\u201croutine\\u201d traffic stops. Remember the New Mexico man who was subjected to a 12-hour ordeal of anal probes, X-rays, enemas, and finally a colonoscopy\\u2014all because he allegedly rolled through a stop sign?\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a right to the expectation of privacy. Despite the staggering number of revelations about government spying on Americans\\u2019 phone calls, Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, Google searches, emails, bookstore and grocery purchases, bank statements, commuter toll records, etc., Congress, the president and the courts have done little to nothing to counteract these abuses. Instead, they seem determined to accustom us to life in this electronic concentration camp.\\n\\nAmericans can no longer rely on the courts to mete out justice. The U.S. Supreme Court was intended to be an institution established to intervene and protect the people against the government and its agents when they overstep their bounds. Yet through their deference to police power, preference for security over freedom, and evisceration of our most basic rights for the sake of order and expediency, the justices of the Supreme Court have become the architects of the American police state in which we now live, while the lower courts have appointed themselves courts of order, concerned primarily with advancing the government\\u2019s agenda, no matter how unjust or illegal.\\n\\nAmericans no longer have a representative government. We have moved beyond the era of representative government and entered a new age, let\\u2019s call it the age of authoritarianism. In fact, a study conducted by Princeton and Northwestern University concluded that the U.S. government does not represent the majority of American citizens. Instead, the study found that the government is ruled by the rich and powerful, or the so-called \\u201ceconomic elite.\\u201d Moreover, the researchers concluded that policies enacted by this governmental elite nearly always favor special interests and lobbying groups. It is not overstating matters to say that Congress, which has done its best to keep their unhappy constituents at a distance, may well be the most self-serving, semi-corrupt institution in America.\\n\\nIn other words, we are being ruled by an oligarchy disguised as a democracy, and arguably on our way towards fascism: a form of government where private corporate interests rule, money calls the shots, and the people are seen as mere subjects to be controlled. Rest assured that when and if fascism finally takes hold in America, the basic forms of government will remain: Fascism will appear to be friendly. The legislators will be in session. There will be elections, and the news media will continue to cover the entertainment and political trivia. Consent of the governed, however, will no longer apply. Actual control will have finally passed to the oligarchic elite controlling the government behind the scenes. Sound familiar? Clearly, we are now ruled by an oligarchic elite of governmental and corporate interests. We have moved into \\u201ccorporatism\\u201d (favored by Benito Mussolini), which is a halfway point on the road to full-blown fascism. Corporatism is where the few moneyed interests\\u2014not elected by the citizenry\\u2014rule over the many.\\n\\nHistory may show that from this point forward, we will have left behind any semblance of constitutional government and entered into a totalitarian state where all citizens are suspects and security trumps freedom. Even with its constantly shifting terrain, this topsy-turvy travesty of law and government has become America\\u2019s new normal. From Clinton to Bush, then Obama and now Trump, it\\u2019s as if we\\u2019ve been caught in a time loop, forced to re-live the same thing over and over again: the same assaults on our freedoms, the same disregard for the rule of law, the same subservience to the Deep State, and the same corrupt, self-serving government that exists only to amass power, enrich its shareholders and ensure its continued domination.\\n\\nElections will not save us.\\n\\nI haven\\u2019t even touched on the corporate state, the military industrial complex, SWAT team raids, invasive surveillance technology, zero tolerance policies in the schools, overcriminalization, or privatized prisons, to name just a few, but what I have touched on should be enough to show that the landscape of our freedoms has already changed dramatically from what it once was and will no doubt continue to deteriorate unless Americans can find a way to wrest back control of their government and reclaim their freedoms.\\n\\nThere can be no denying that the world is indeed a dangerous place, but what the president and his cohorts fail to acknowledge is that it\\u2019s the government that poses the gravest threat to our freedoms and way of life, and no amount of politicking, parsing or pandering will change that.\\n\\nIt is easy to be diverted, distracted and amused by the antics of politicians, the pomp and circumstance of awards shows, athletic events, and entertainment news, and the feel-good, wrapped-in-the-flag evangelism that passes for religion today.\\n\\nWhat is far more difficult to face up to is the reality of life in America, where unemployment, poverty, inequality, injustice and violence by government agents are increasingly norms, and where \\u201cwe the people\\u201d are at a distinct disadvantage in the face of the government elite\\u2019s power grabs, greed and firepower.\\n\\nThe Constitution doesn\\u2019t stand a chance against a federalized, globalized standing army protected by legislative, judicial and executive branches that are all on the same side, no matter what political views they subscribe to: suffice it to say, they are not on our side or the side of freedom.\\n\\nAs I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the powers-that-be want us to remain distracted, divided, alienated from each other based on our politics, our bank accounts, our religion, our race and our value systems. Yet as George Orwell observed, \\u201cThe real division is not between conservatives and revolutionaries but between authoritarians and libertarians.\\u201d\\n\\nYou either believe in freedom or you don\\u2019t. It\\u2019s that simple.\\n\\nEverything else is just a deadly distraction. As Orwell observed in 1984:\\n\\nConstitutional attorney and author John W.
