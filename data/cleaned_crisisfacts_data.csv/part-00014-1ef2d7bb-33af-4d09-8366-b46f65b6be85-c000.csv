CrisisFACTS-010-Reddit-1419-5,CrisisFACTS-010,taking icy worlds as an example making decent ice textures that distinguish themselves clearly from dead metallic planets is apparently already a herculean task so well pretty much have to take what we have for a while unless they get to really surprise us with this update and roll in some kind of atmospherics as well  but not counting on it,"{\"body\": \"Atmospheres must still be part of their plan but remember they have actual statistics to justify their design priorities. Perhaps they have very good (quantifiable) reason to believe that atmospheres are only going to be majorly appreciated by players AFTER they can build bases and such inside those planets.\\n\\nThere's also the matter of producing new assets - with space legs you do have a lot to add but you can build up from things you crept up on pre-production  - the little widgets you allow players inside their ships, station assets and so on are surely going to be used for the environments you can walk inside of as well. Whereas in their case it's pretty much a whole new game to make if they are to add entire types of climates (even stationary ones that never change, let alone things that should have a semblance of weather). \\n\\nAs much as I want atmospheric landings as well I'd like to imagine they are delaying it until it doesn't look like \\\"just the dead planets from before, but with clouds\\\" and also because, like I said, their best use case for atmospheric landings is precisely first adding base building and walking gameplay so that players can quite literally set a foot on those amazing new worlds. Taking Icy worlds as an example, making decent Ice textures that distinguish themselves clearly from dead metallic planets is apparently already a herculean task, so we'll pretty much have to take what we have for a while (unless they get to REALLY surprise us with this update and roll in some kind of atmospherics as well - but not counting on it).\", \"created_utc\": 1580239725.0, \"ups\": 8, \"downs\": 0, \"controversiality\": 0, \"id\": \"ffudl9j\", \"parent_id\": \"t1_fftg1yb\", \"author\": \"mgm50\"}",Reddit,1580239725

CrisisFACTS-010-Reddit-1472-14,CrisisFACTS-010,same applies to wandering around corridors with little gameplay to back it up,"{\"body\": \"I have to disagree with the idea that because Space Legs was planned from Day 1, that Space Legs will work well in Elite. The game was designed for space legs. The game we currently have is not the game that was designed, it is far from complete, years of rushed updates have seen to that. It is full of placeholder mechanics and straight-up missing features. In fact, I think the third quote is closest to the truth. You have correctly pointed out that the game was designed for Space Legs, but that doesn't mean the second half of the quote can be ignored. *Everything will have to be redesigned to fit Space Legs*\\n\\nMulticrew highlights this. Theoretically, that's kind of a big deal for a multiplayer game like Elite, the ability to join up with other CMDRs and work together. But the gameplay loops present are so minimalist that it's practically useless for everything except combat, and even there that's more so because having an extra person sat in the seats magically gives your ship a bit of a buff.\\n\\nThe way I see it, there are three possible outcomes for Space Legs. Either, we get an incredibly minimalist implementation, for example moving around your ship, with little gameplay attached. A placeholder, like Multicrew, Piracy, Smuggling, Bounty Hunting, NPCs, and the ingame \\\"economy\\\". It will be cool at first, and then abandoned. How many people drive around near-identical planets for the fun of it? Same applies to wandering around corridors with little gameplay to back it up. This option is like when Planetary Landings came out but Engineers wasn't released.\\n\\nSecondly, we get some gameplay (FPS with Thargoids comes to mind), but it's almost entirely segregated from existing gameplay. For example, the \\\"gameplay\\\" present on planets, where the only reason you'll ever actually visit those planets is that Selenium doesn't exist anywhere else and you have no choice. Or like Powerplay, which is sort of bolted-on to the existing BGS without much interaction. This option is like Planetary Landings but after a few years and the Engineers revamp.\\n\\nAlternatively, the New Era is so massive that it redesigns the entire game to fit Space Legs. This is the best option, but also *by far* the most difficult.\\n\\nUnless the third option comes to pass, you have to ask yourself what meaningful gameplay Space Legs could bring to the current game. Walking down a corridor to pay off your fine, rather than going via a menu? Getting out of your SRV to stand on the barren, featureless rock and manually pick up the Vanadium? Moving to another part of your ship, leaving it defenceless and immobile while you right-click on a panel to do what an AFMU does?\\n\\nThis all ignores the technical issues. The networking in this game is buggy enough having people be separated from their ships, which massively increases the complexity of things in a multiplayer setting. Space Legs being planned from Day 1 didn't stop Multicrew being incompatible with SRVs for technical reasons, two much-smaller features that were released much closer together in time.
