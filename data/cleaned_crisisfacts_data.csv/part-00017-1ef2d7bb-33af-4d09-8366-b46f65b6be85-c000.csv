Giger is also a leader of Our Revolution Michiana, a regional chapter of the political organization that was born out of Bernie Sanders\\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\\n\\nThe board in July scheduled seven \\u201ccommunity advisory groups,\\u201d wherein city officials would \\u201cpublicly solicit input from residents on a range of law enforcement issues\\u201d for August and September, and later added an eighth meeting in November. Buttigieg, now one of the top contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, attended only one of those meetings \\u2014 the second-to-last one, on September 19 \\u2014 a day after after activists spoke to CNBC about his absence. While Buttigieg was never meant to lead those meetings, activists in the city say his absence was glaring.\\n\\nAmid widespread criticism of policing in South Bend, Indiana, following the June 2019 shooting of Eric Logan, a 54-year-old black resident, then-Mayor Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s administration established a series of public meetings with the Board of Public Safety, the disciplinary body overseeing the police department. While Buttigieg said his administration was taking \\u201csteps that were empowering for residents,\\u201d the presidential candidate attended only one of those eight meetings, traveling across the country for fundraisers, speaking engagements, and campaign events instead.\\n\\nButtigieg\\u2019s relationship with black residents in the city he led for seven years as mayor has been a major sore point in his campaign, especially as he rose in some early state polls in the winter. But he has largely gotten by without having to answer one of the most glaring questions standing between him and the nomination: how he\\u2019ll win over black voters when he\\u2019s polling at just 2 percent with that demographic nationally, and at zero in South Carolina \\u2014 an early primary state with a large black electorate.\\n\\nBlack Lives Matter activists, including some from South Bend, have protested at Buttigieg\\u2019s campaign events in states like California and Iowa. The local Black Lives Matter chapter has taken issue with the mayor since his inauguration, not long after which he asked for the resignation of the city\\u2019s black police chief, whom he later demoted after significant pushback. The group protested again last week, ahead of the debate at a campaign event in Iowa, clashing with Buttigieg supporters who shouted chants of \\u201cBoot-Edge-Edge\\u201d and \\u201cUSA, USA\\u201d over activists chanting \\u201canti-black, anti-poor\\u201d as they were escorted out of the venue.\\n\\nSafety\\u2019s meetings were open to the public, and included members of the local Group Violence Intervention Core Group, a coalition of community leaders working to end gun violence, members of the Common Council, South Bend Police Department leadership, and members of the mayor\\u2019s office. At each meeting, the group reviewed various police policies and took input from community members. Activists negotiated their concerns into changes the police department would consider implementing into their policy manual, a process that\\u2019s currently underway.\\n\\nThe community advisory group meetings took place on August 8, 15, 20, 27; September 5, 12, 19; and November 7. For all but one of those dates, Buttigieg was at fundraisers, campaign events, and speeches around the country, including the September Democratic debate in Houston. He spoke at several of those events about the issue of race and how his administration had addressed related concerns in South Bend.\\n\\nIn a statement, the Buttigieg campaign pointed out that the candidate returned to South Bend in the wake of Logan\\u2019s killing to be with his community during that difficult time, and that he took a number of other steps before leaving office on January 1 to mend police-community relations.\\n\\n\\u201cSince then, Pete has taken a series of actions to help the South Bend community begin to heal \\u2014 including supporting the creation of community action groups that were organized by the Board of Public Safety,\\u201d campaign spokesperson Sean Savett wrote in an email. \\u201cIn the meantime, Pete worked to make policy changes before leaving office to try to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again. It\\u2019s been a difficult time for many in South Bend but survey results recently found that trust is improving between the community and the police, and that the Community Action Group Meetings with South Bend Police were a major factor.\\u201d\\n\\nOn August 8, Buttigieg addressed attendees at the National Association of Black Journalists\\u2019 annual conference in Miami, saying the \\u201cwhole country is in danger by white supremacy.\\u201d That day, the community advisory board held its kickoff meeting. Plainclothes officers arrived carrying firearms, which angered community members. A spokesperson for Logan\\u2019s brother Tyree Bonds wrote an op-ed in the South Bend Tribune describing the armed presence as \\u201cinsensitivity and intimidation.\\u201d\\n\\nOn August 15, Buttigieg was on his second day in a stint of campaign events in Iowa. The same day, the community advisory group held a meeting on the police department\\u2019s body camera policy.\\n\\nOn August 20, when South Bend\\u2019s community advisory group was discussing South Bend\\u2019s police use-of-force policy, Buttigieg held a fundraiser in Chicago at the offices of Clayco, a construction company whose founder and executive chair, Bob Clark, was a major supporter of former President Barack Obama. In 2010, Obama appointed him to the Committee for the Preservation of the White House. Clark contributed at least $5,600 to both Buttigieg\\u2019s primary and general election funds.

But his critics say those things only created the appearance that the city was addressing their concerns.\\n\\nIn areas where the mayor could have changed things that would have had an immediate impact on the community, like firing Police Chief Scott Ruszkowski, BLM South Bend activists say he ignored their input.

In 2010, Obama appointed him to the Committee for the Preservation of the White House. Clark contributed at least $5,600 to both Buttigieg\\u2019s primary and general election funds. He gave the maximum $2,800 to Biden\\u2019s campaign last April, and another $5,000 in March to Biden\\u2019s former political action committee, American Possibilities PAC, which shut down in August.

Later that night, Buttigieg appeared on the Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\\n\\nThe day before the next community advisory group\\u2019s September 19 meeting, CNBC reported that local activists had complained that Buttigieg had so far failed to attend any of those meetings. On September 19, he returned to South Bend to attend the meeting after speaking at a town hall in Columbia, South Carolina, earlier in the day. (According to his campaign, he had already been scheduled to attend the board meeting.)\\n\\nOn November 7, South Bend\\u2019s Board of Public Safety held an eighth additional community advisory group meeting to review the police department\\u2019s process for conducting internal investigations. That day, Buttigieg attended two fundraisers in New York City; tickets for one started at $1,000, the other at $2,800.\\n\\nhe\\u2019s not one to shrink away from tough conversations, even with his critics, and that his administration took steps in the wake of Logan\\u2019s killing to engage with the community to make things better. When faced with questions on his record in South Bend, Buttigieg, his former mayoral office, and his campaign tout the same kinds of things: Buttigieg commissioned South Bend\\u2019s first-ever disparity study, he created the city\\u2019s first of the office of diversity and inclusion, and he appointed a majority-minority Board of Public Safety. But his critics say those things only created the appearance that the city was addressing their concerns.\\n\\nIn areas where the mayor could have changed things that would have had an immediate impact on the community, like firing Police Chief Scott Ruszkowski, BLM South Bend activists say he ignored their input. They also say Buttigieg ignored their calls to change the Board of Public Safety\\u2019s leadership and give community members a say in the appointment process, which he handled as mayor.\\n\\nThe city\\u2019s Black Lives Matter chapter has also called, along with the South Bend Tribune and other city officials, for Buttigieg to establish an independent civilian review board to evaluate officer shootings and cases of misconduct. The South Bend Tribune in a July editorial said Buttigieg had \\u201cbeen urged to take this step many times during his tenure as mayor \\u2014 by members of the public, current and former members of the Common Council and by this board,\\u201d and that while he \\u201chas spent much time talking about the issues of race and policing,\\u201d it was time for the mayor \\u201cto match action with words.\\u201d\\n\\nBLM activists told CNBC in September that in the month following Logan\\u2019s shooting, Buttigieg promised them he would release data from a racial bias test administered to members of the police department, and provide information on securing mental health services for Logan\\u2019s family.

Buttigieg, now one of the top contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, attended only one of those meetings \\u2014 the second-to-last one, on September 19 \\u2014 a day after after activists spoke to CNBC about his absence. While Buttigieg was never meant to lead those meetings, activists in the city say his absence was glaring.\\n\\nAmid widespread criticism of policing in South Bend, Indiana, following the June 2019 shooting of Eric Logan, a 54-year-old black resident, then-Mayor Pete Buttigieg\\u2019s administration established a series of public meetings with the Board of Public Safety, the disciplinary body overseeing the police department. While Buttigieg said his administration was taking \\u201csteps that were empowering for residents,\\u201d the presidential candidate attended only one of those eight meetings, traveling across the country for fundraisers, speaking engagements, and campaign events instead.\\n\\nButtigieg\\u2019s relationship with black residents in the city he led for seven years as mayor has been a major sore point in his campaign, especially as he rose in some early state polls in the winter. But he has largely gotten by without having to answer one of the most glaring questions standing between him and the nomination: how he\\u2019ll win over black voters when he\\u2019s polling at just 2 percent with that demographic nationally, and at zero in South Carolina \\u2014 an early primary state with a large black electorate.\\n\\nBlack Lives Matter activists, including some from South Bend, have protested at Buttigieg\\u2019s campaign events in states like California and Iowa. The local Black Lives Matter chapter has taken issue with the mayor since his inauguration, not long after which he asked for the resignation of the city\\u2019s black police chief, whom he later demoted after significant pushback. The group protested again last week, ahead of the debate at a campaign event in Iowa, clashing with Buttigieg supporters who shouted chants of \\u201cBoot-Edge-Edge\\u201d and \\u201cUSA, USA\\u201d over activists chanting \\u201canti-black, anti-poor\\u201d as they were escorted out of the venue.\\n\\nSafety\\u2019s meetings were open to the public, and included members of the local Group Violence Intervention Core Group, a coalition of community leaders working to end gun violence, members of the Common Council, South Bend Police Department leadership, and members of the mayor\\u2019s office. At each meeting, the group reviewed various police policies and took input from community members. Activists negotiated their concerns into changes the police department would consider implementing into their policy manual, a process that\\u2019s currently underway.\\n\\nThe community advisory group meetings took place on August 8, 15, 20, 27; September 5, 12, 19; and November 7. For all but one of those dates, Buttigieg was at fundraisers, campaign events, and speeches around the country, including the September Democratic debate in Houston. He spoke at several of those events about the issue of race and how his administration had addressed related concerns in South Bend.\\n\\nIn a statement, the Buttigieg campaign pointed out that the candidate returned to South Bend in the wake of Logan\\u2019s killing to be with his community during that difficult time, and that he took a number of other steps before leaving office on January 1 to mend police-community relations.\\n\\n\\u201cSince then, Pete has taken a series of actions to help the South Bend community begin to heal \\u2014 including supporting the creation of community action groups that were organized by the Board of Public Safety,\\u201d campaign spokesperson Sean Savett wrote in an email. \\u201cIn the meantime, Pete worked to make policy changes before leaving office to try to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again. It\\u2019s been a difficult time for many in South Bend but survey results recently found that trust is improving between the community and the police, and that the Community Action Group Meetings with South Bend Police were a major factor.\\u201d\\n\\nOn August 8, Buttigieg addressed attendees at the National Association of Black Journalists\\u2019 annual conference in Miami, saying the \\u201cwhole country is in danger by white supremacy.\\u201d That day, the community advisory board held its kickoff meeting.

I've been coughing a lot [this year].\\\"\\n\\nIt has been like this for months, says Shehzad, throughout what has come to be known in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore, home to more than 10 million people, as \\\"smog season\\\".\\n\\nCome October, changing weather patterns, high levels of environmental pollution and seasonal crop burning combine to make the air in Lahore some of the most toxic in the world, with the city's air quality index (AQI) reading regularly topping 500 (the upper limit on most meters), according to AirVisual, an international air quality monitoring service.\\n\\nThe AQI is a measure formulated by the United States' Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to measure how healthy or polluted air is, and takes into account levels of five major air pollutants.\\n\\nAny reading higher than 100 is considered \\\"unhealthy\\\", with readings higher than 300 considered \\\"hazardous\\\", according to international standards. Pakistan's classification system for AQI considers levels up to 200 to be \\\"satisfactory\\\".\\n\\nIn 2015, an estimated 135,000 Pakistanis died due to air pollution, a study published in the medical journal The Lancet found. Perhaps more crucially, the study found that air pollution cost Pakistanis more than 42.3 million disability-adjusted life years - averaged out over Pakistan's cities, where air pollution is concentrated, that amounts to more than a year off every single urban citizen's life.\\n\\nIn Lahore, a growing metropolis that is a hub of commercial activity in Pakistan's Punjab province, the AQI during the four months between October and January rarely dips below \\\"hazardous\\\" levels. This year, for the first time ever, the provincial government shut down schools for three days due to hazardous air quality, asking citizens to remain indoors as much as possible.\\n\\nFor many in Pakistan, where the average per capita income is less than $1,600 a year, staying indoors, however, is simply not an option.\\n\\n\\\"My whole family can eat [only] because I am running this pushcart,\\\" says Jalal Hazrat Syed, a 24-year-old migrant to Lahore who sells household electrical equipment off a wooden cart in the old city. \\\"If I shut it down, what will they do?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's easier for those who work in offices. If I don't work for a day, we don't eat that day.\\\"\\n\\nThis year, the government and activists have been encouraging citizens to wear filter face masks to protect themselves while outdoors in the smog, as well as to install air purifiers at home to filter the air.\\n\\nThe main danger from the smog is high levels of particulate matter that is less than 2.5 microns in diameter, known as PM2.5. Such particles can be absorbed directly into the blood and organs after being breathed in, and have been linked to higher rates of cardiovascular disease, respiratory problems and other diseases.\\n\\nPakistan's standard for \\\"safe\\\" levels of PM2.5 in the air is 35 microns per cubic metre. At the peak of smog season, the level was regularly more than 15 times that amount.\\n\\nFor many in Pakistan, however, buying air purifiers for their homes or workspaces is out of the question, given their high cost.\\n\\n\\\"We would see the smog descend in the evenings, mostly,\\\" said Faiz-ul-Islam, 30, a tea seller in the city's congested Shah Alami market. \\\"It is unlikely, given I earn 15,000 rupees a month [$96], that I would be able to buy an air purifier.\\\"\\n\\nMost air purifiers in Pakistani stores are imported, with prices starting at about 30,000 rupees ($194), or roughly double the monthly minimum wage. Prices for face masks certified to filter out PM2.5 particles are more affordable, however, with most masks retailing for roughly 200 rupees (about $1.30).\\n\\nIslam says he has no choice but to go to work, no matter what the air quality, because he needs to earn a living.\\n\\n\\\"I cannot survive for a single day without going outside and working,\\\" he says. \\\"[If we are forced to stay home], I will be forced into debt, and it will take months to work it off.\\\"\\n\\nA new generation of Pakistani activists, however, is working to change all that.\\n\\n'We work together, or die together'\\n\\nYoung Pakistanis have taken on a leadership role in demanding that the government apply more sustainable environmental policies and take climate change more seriously.\\n\\nIn September, thousands of young people marched in 26 cities across the country to register their protest against unsustainable climate policies, joining a global movement dubbed the Global Climate Strike.\\n\\nNida Afzal, a student at Lahore's Punjab University, was among those marching.\\n\\n\\\"[If] I am living under a system that is oppressing me and doesn't allow me to speak the truth, then I should leave that system, right?\\\" she says. \\\"That seems to be anarchist, but it is really not anarchist.

A labourer cannot come forward to put his life and his wages in danger to say that they don't accept corporations. We should not expect that, either. We need to work with them and work for their rights, but we should not expect them to be revolutionaries.\\\"\\n\\nPakistan's government dismisses criticism of its policies, saying it is taking effective steps to take on the smog crisis.\\n\\nAccording to a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (UNFAO) report commissioned by the Punjab government, roughly 43 percent of the province's air pollution is attributable to vehicle emissions. A further 24 percent is from industrial emissions, 20 percent from the burning of crops in the winter season, and 12 percent from the country's mainly coal- and furnace oil-fired power plants.\\n\\n\\\"We have identified that it relates to petroleum and oils that we import or manufacture in our refineries,\\\" says Tanveer Ahmed Warraich, director general of the provincial Environmental Protection Agency. \\\"The government wants that whatever fuel we import, it must be of better quality.\\\"\\n\\nCurrently, Pakistan uses Euro-II standards for the quality of fuels used in vehicles, which allows for higher levels of pollutants. For example, the sulphur content in Euro-II grade diesel fuel is roughly 50 times higher than current global standards.\\n\\nVehicle inspection standards, however, remain lax, and many inefficient or higher polluting vehicles continue to ply Pakistan's roads. Warraich said his agency aims to impound 20 vehicles a day after spot checks on Lahore's roads.\\n\\nAccording to a 2017 Smog Policy, the government is also working on reducing industrial emissions, especially from the more than 10,000 brick kilns scattered across Punjab province. The government is incentivising brick kiln owners to switch to more efficient \\\"zigzag\\\" technology at their kilns.\\n\\nOn crop burning, Warraich said more than 400 farmers were arrested this year for burning the stubble from the rice harvest to clear their fields for the upcoming wheat season.\\n\\nOthers, however, say the action is simply not fast enough to take on what is a \\\"crisis\\\".\\n\\n\\\"A lot of the measures that were supposed to be immediately implemented, I am yet to see evidence of that,\\\" said Attiya Noon, an environmental activist who sits on the government's anti-smog committee.\\n\\n\\\"That's the biggest gap, that you see political will, you see action even in terms of these meetings ... however, it remains to be seen when and how it will be implemented.\\\"\\n\\nFor those working on the streets of Lahore, action cannot come too soon.\\n\\n\\\"When the smog was bad [this year], we'd tell our kids to stay indoors, in their own rooms,\\\" says Shehzad, the electrical store worker. \\\"But if I stay at home, how will we eat?

I've been coughing a lot [this year].\\\"\\n\\nIt has been like this for months, says Shehzad, throughout what has come to be known in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore, home to more than 10 million people, as \\\"smog season\\\".\\n\\nCome October, changing weather patterns, high levels of environmental pollution and seasonal crop burning combine to make the air in Lahore some of the most toxic in the world, with the city's air quality index (AQI) reading regularly topping 500 (the upper limit on most meters), according to AirVisual, an international air quality monitoring service.\\n\\nThe AQI is a measure formulated by the United States' Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to measure how healthy or polluted air is, and takes into account levels of five major air pollutants.\\n\\nAny reading higher than 100 is considered \\\"unhealthy\\\", with readings higher than 300 considered \\\"hazardous\\\", according to international standards. Pakistan's classification system for AQI considers levels up to 200 to be \\\"satisfactory\\\".\\n\\nIn 2015, an estimated 135,000 Pakistanis died due to air pollution, a study published in the medical journal The Lancet found. Perhaps more crucially, the study found that air pollution cost Pakistanis more than 42.3 million disability-adjusted life years - averaged out over Pakistan's cities, where air pollution is concentrated, that amounts to more than a year off every single urban citizen's life.\\n\\nIn Lahore, a growing metropolis that is a hub of commercial activity in Pakistan's Punjab province, the AQI during the four months between October and January rarely dips below \\\"hazardous\\\" levels. This year, for the first time ever, the provincial government shut down schools for three days due to hazardous air quality, asking citizens to remain indoors as much as possible.\\n\\nFor many in Pakistan, where the average per capita income is less than $1,600 a year, staying indoors, however, is simply not an option.\\n\\n\\\"My whole family can eat [only] because I am running this pushcart,\\\" says Jalal Hazrat Syed, a 24-year-old migrant to Lahore who sells household electrical equipment off a wooden cart in the old city. \\\"If I shut it down, what will they do?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's easier for those who work in offices. If I don't work for a day, we don't eat that day.\\\"\\n\\nThis year, the government and activists have been encouraging citizens to wear filter face masks to protect themselves while outdoors in the smog, as well as to install air purifiers at home to filter the air.\\n\\nThe main danger from the smog is high levels of particulate matter that is less than 2.5 microns in diameter, known as PM2.5. Such particles can be absorbed directly into the blood and organs after being breathed in, and have been linked to higher rates of cardiovascular disease, respiratory problems and other diseases.\\n\\nPakistan's standard for \\\"safe\\\" levels of PM2.5 in the air is 35 microns per cubic metre.

Each week we\\u2019ll bring you news and analysis from the CQ Roll Call team that will keep you informed about the 2020 election. Know someone who\\u2019d like to get this newsletter? They can subscribe here.\\n\\nThe impeachment trial we\\u2019ve all been prognosticating about for weeks is finally here, in all its exhausting, late-night glory. And yet, on the campaign trail, the conversation remains largely unchanged. The biggest impact has been on senators running for president or facing competitive reelections back home. They have been sidelined in Washington, unable to attend fundraisers or even check their phones for hours on end.\\n\\nRepublicans continue to hammer vulnerable Democrats on impeachment, with the pro-Trump group America First Policies launching an attack ad against Alabama Democrat Doug Jones, the most vulnerable senator facing reelection in 2020. But Democrats still largely aren\\u2019t going there. While some national Democratic groups and even some Senate candidates are using impeachment in their fundraising emails, voters are likely to hear a lot more from them about prescription drug costs, Medicare and Social Security than impeachment, as the super PAC Priorities USA made clear in a memo this week.\\n\\nOne key state to watch: Maine, where a majority of likely voters thought President Donald Trump \\u201cabused\\u201d the power of his office, according to a poll conducted last week for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC allied with Senate Democrats. More than 70 percent of Mainers wanted the Senate to \\u201cinsist\\u201d on seeing fresh evidence and hearing from witnesses. GOP Sen. Susan Collins has already broken with her party on one vote this week \\u2014 she sided with Democrats to allow for more time to respond to motions made during the trial. But that doesn\\u2019t mean she\\u2019s going to break with Democrats on the big vote, or that it would necessarily benefit her politically to do so. Like her GOP peers in Arizona and Colorado, she needs to show moderates that she\\u2019s still an independent thinker while not alienating Trump\\u2019s base.\\n\\nIn the trial, off the trail: Senators running for president aren\\u2019t the only ones stuck in the chamber for the impeachment trial. So are vulnerable senators in both parties, whose campaigns have had to adjust to the proceedings, which keep these senators in the Capitol for hours on end.\\n\\n#CA25: This cycle, congressional candidates will have to compete with the presidential race for attention, money and TV time. But candidates running to replace former California Democratic Rep. Katie Hill face an additional challenge: reminding people that there are two elections in the same congressional district on the same day as Super Tuesday. The potential for voter confusion is raising concerns, and Democrats are trying to figure out what to do about it.\\n\\n2022 on the brain: Both parties are targeting six states this year because they want to control the redrawing of congressional maps following the 2020 census. CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Michael Macagnone and Jacob Fischler detail the fight for control of state legislatures that will decide on redistricting in a handful of key states.\\n\\nTrackers gonna track: The DCCC cried foul over the NRCC\\u2019s use of trackers recently, filing a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics. Democrats argue that Republicans\\u2019 use of trackers in House hallways to record vulnerable Democrats violates ethics rules that bar official resources from being used for campaigns. Ethics experts told CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Chris Marquette that the DCCC may have a point.\\n\\nWho\\u2019s that lady? A suburban mom named Stacy is getting a lot of attention for being upset about impeachment. But as we first noted last Friday, she seems to live in 11 different congressional districts. Now Jimmy Kimmel has picked up on her starring role in American Action Network\\u2019s ads, which are attacking House Democrats from Nevada to Maine. So just who are the people who appear in campaign ads \\u2014 and how much do political groups have to identify them? Revisit our 2018 explainer.\\n\\nEndorsements: Members of Congress continued to take sides in the presidential race. Joe Biden nabbed five more House endorsements: Alabama\\u2019s Terri A. Sewell, Florida\\u2019s Frederica Wilson and Alcee L. Hastings, Georgia\\u2019s Sanford D. Bishop and New Jersey\\u2019s Donald M. Payne Jr. (One bonus Biden endorsement that\\u2019s Congress-adjacent: New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen\\u2019s husband Bill Shaheen, a DNC member, backed the former VP). Three House lawmakers endorsed Mike Bloomberg: California\\u2019s Harley Rouda, Florida\\u2019s Stephanie Murphy and Illinois\\u2019 Bobby L. Rush. And leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus split over the more liberal candidates in the race. Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal endorsed Bernie Sanders and Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin backed Elizabeth Warren.\\n\\nOh Kay: After taking a few years off from taking on sitting House Republicans, the conservative Club for Growth is taking aim at Texas GOP Rep. Kay Granger, Politico reported Thursday. The group is planning a TV, digital and mail campaign against the congresswoman, the top Republican on the powerful Appropriations Committee. Granger faces former Colleyville City Councilmember Chris Putnam in the March 3 primary, and he\\u2019s been putting up a fight so far. The Texas Tribune has a good primer on the race.\\n\\nGOP $$$: NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer recently lowered expectations for Republican fundraising. But some House Republicans have figured out how to raise eye-popping numbers, including two who have leveraged their national profiles. Texas Rep. Daniel Crenshaw\\u2019s campaign told the Houston Chronicle that the freshman lawmaker raised $1.6 million in the final fundraising quarter of 2019. And former House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes raised $2.1 million in the quarter, according to the Washington Examiner.\\n\\nJersey style: What was supposed to be one of New Jersey Democrat Josh Gottheimer\\u2019s tame diner chats with constituents turned contentious this week, when a former state Assembly speaker confronted the congressman over impeachment.\\n\\nTwo-way race: Labor lawyer Shannon Liss-Riordan dropped her primary bid in the Massachusetts Senate race, leaving Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III and incumbent Edward J. Markey in the Democratic race.\\n\\nThanks, but no thanks: Utah Republican Thom Carter says he won\\u2019t run for the GOP nod to challenge freshman Democrat Ben McAdams in the state\\u2019s swingy 4th District. Carter, the executive director of the Utah Clean Air Partnership, said national Republicans had been recruiting him amid concerns about the caliber of current candidates in the crowded primary.\\n\\nTaking sides: Main Street Partnership PAC became the first national group to back one of Iowa GOP Rep. Steve King\\u2019s top primary challengers: state Sen. Randy Feenstra. King has been sidelined in the House due to racist comments, and Feenstra, the top GOP fundraiser so far, is one of five Republicans who have filed to challenge the nine-term congressman. Main Street Partnership PAC, which describes itself as supportive of the \\u201cgoverning\\u201d wing of the GOP, backed three other House candidates this week: Chele Farley in New York\\u2019s 18th District, Amanda Makki in Florida\\u2019s 13th and Sue Rezin in Illinois\\u2019 14th.\\n\\nIowa! (but not about the caucuses): Stu Rothenberg dives into Trump\\u2019s prospects of winning Iowa in 2020.\\n\\nIowa! (OK, this one\\u2019s about the caucuses): The Iowa caucuses are less than two weeks away, people! The Associated Press has a roundup of how presidential candidates (especially those stuck in D.C. for the impeachment trial) are deploying their surrogates throughout the state. We explained in December how being able to tap someone who knows how to make a political pitch to a crowd is one of the values of getting House and Senate members to endorse you.\\n\\n#AZSEN: National Journal\\u2019s Josh Kraushaar writes that Arizona GOP Sen. Martha McSally\\u2019s approach to her 2020 race signals she hasn\\u2019t learned the lessons of her 2018 loss. \\u201cHer base-first approach to politics is a sign of weakness, for a candidate furiously trying to generate support in the worst possible way,\\u201d he writes.\\n\\nOK, Bloomer: It\\u2019s no secret that Bloomberg has been blanketing the airwaves with ads for his presidential run. But his strategy could jack up ad prices for everyone else, Politico reports.\\n\\nRest your head: Mike Lindell has been a fixture on the Midwestern campaign trail for Trump and down-ballot Republicans over the past few years. Now the MyPillow founder \\u201cis becoming less coy about his political future\\u201d in Minnesota, the Star Tribune\\u2019s Stephen Montemayor writes.\\n\\nTryin\\u2019 Ryan?: Ohio radio station WKSU takes a look at the 7-way GOP primary in the 13th District, currently occupied by failed 2020 presidential candidate Rep. Tim Ryan, and concludes the Democrat could be up against one of the toughest elections of his career.\\n\\nUmm \\u2026 ew: William Figlesthaler, who is vying for the GOP nomination for retiring Florida Rep. Francis Rooney\\u2019s seat, put his name on \\u201cDrain the Swamp\\u201d urinal screens at the 7,000-seat Hertz Arena. At least he didn\\u2019t use his picture.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s the number of bills and joint resolutions lawmakers introduced in 2019 \\u2014 23 percent more than in 2017, the first year of the previous Congress. That show of initiative might be surprising given how little actually becomes law, but as CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Mike Teitelbaum explains, there can be other incentives to introducing legislation, especially for House freshmen.\\n\\nWas Hillary Clinton a terrible candidate? That\\u2019s the question Nathan L. Gonzales tries to answer with the \\u201cVote Above Replacement\\u201d metric developed for Inside Elections.\\n\\nIn California\\u2019s 25th District, Democrat Christy Smith is using the tagline, \\u201cFor once in your life, vote twice!\\u201d to remind voters to vote in both the special election primary to replace former Rep. Katie Hill and the primary for a full term, which are both happening on March 3. Smith, a state assemblywoman, told CQ Roll Call in an interview that her finance director was initially joking around when she came up with the tagline. But Smith and her campaign decided it could resonate with voters. The slogan is about \\u201cmaking sure that voters understand that it is not only acceptable, but we\\u2019d really prefer that they do vote twice,\\u201d Smith said with a laugh.\\n\\nMontana isn\\u2019t a competitive part of the Senate battlefield \\u2014 yet. Inside Elections rates GOP Sen. Steve Daines\\u2019 reelection Solid Republican. But despite electing Trump by 20 points in 2016, Montanans have a history of splitting their tickets. The same year they backed Trump, they reelected Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock by nearly 4 points. Two years later, they reelected Democratic Sen. Jon Tester by nearly 4 points \\u2014 the first time he won with more than 50 percent of the vote. Democrats also contested the at-large House seat. So even though Trump will almost certainly again carry Montana by double digits this year, Democrats haven\\u2019t given up on the 2020 Senate race.\\n\\nAll eyes remain on Bullock, who dropped his presidential bid in December and has repeatedly said he won\\u2019t run for Senate. But there\\u2019s still time. The filing deadline is March 9, about a week after the state party\\u2019s big Democratic dinner, where Bullock will likely feel some heat to run. If he stays out, Cora Neumann \\u2014 one of several Democrats already in the race \\u2014 could solidify party support in the June 2 primary. Neuman, who has a Ph.D. in public health and worked with the Global First Ladies Alliance and the State Department\\u2019s Economic Bureau, hasn\\u2019t yet filed numbers with the Federal Election Commission, but her campaign announced earlier this month it raised more than $460,000 between October and Dec. 31. Daines starts with an edge, though, not the least of which is financial: He had $4.2 million in the bank at the end of September.\\n\\nFor next week, let us know if you\\u2019d like to learn more about the Arizona Senate race or the South Carolina Senate race. Email us at attheraces@cqrollcall.com.\\n\\nOne week before the Iowa caucuses, the Democratic presidential candidates will get their own town halls on CNN.

And yet, on the campaign trail, the conversation remains largely unchanged. The biggest impact has been on senators running for president or facing competitive reelections back home. They have been sidelined in Washington, unable to attend fundraisers or even check their phones for hours on end.\\n\\nRepublicans continue to hammer vulnerable Democrats on impeachment, with the pro-Trump group America First Policies launching an attack ad against Alabama Democrat Doug Jones, the most vulnerable senator facing reelection in 2020. But Democrats still largely aren\\u2019t going there. While some national Democratic groups and even some Senate candidates are using impeachment in their fundraising emails, voters are likely to hear a lot more from them about prescription drug costs, Medicare and Social Security than impeachment, as the super PAC Priorities USA made clear in a memo this week.\\n\\nOne key state to watch: Maine, where a majority of likely voters thought President Donald Trump \\u201cabused\\u201d the power of his office, according to a poll conducted last week for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC allied with Senate Democrats. More than 70 percent of Mainers wanted the Senate to \\u201cinsist\\u201d on seeing fresh evidence and hearing from witnesses. GOP Sen.

Carter, the executive director of the Utah Clean Air Partnership, said national Republicans had been recruiting him amid concerns about the caliber of current candidates in the crowded primary.\\n\\nTaking sides: Main Street Partnership PAC became the first national group to back one of Iowa GOP Rep. Steve King\\u2019s top primary challengers: state Sen. Randy Feenstra. King has been sidelined in the House due to racist comments, and Feenstra, the top GOP fundraiser so far, is one of five Republicans who have filed to challenge the nine-term congressman. Main Street Partnership PAC, which describes itself as supportive of the \\u201cgoverning\\u201d wing of the GOP, backed three other House candidates this week: Chele Farley in New York\\u2019s 18th District, Amanda Makki in Florida\\u2019s 13th and Sue Rezin in Illinois\\u2019 14th.\\n\\nIowa!

The Associated Press has a roundup of how presidential candidates (especially those stuck in D.C. for the impeachment trial) are deploying their surrogates throughout the state.

That show of initiative might be surprising given how little actually becomes law, but as CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Mike Teitelbaum explains, there can be other incentives to introducing legislation, especially for House freshmen.\\n\\nWas Hillary Clinton a terrible candidate? That\\u2019s the question Nathan L. Gonzales tries to answer with the \\u201cVote Above Replacement\\u201d metric developed for Inside Elections.\\n\\nIn California\\u2019s 25th District, Democrat Christy Smith is using the tagline, \\u201cFor once in your life, vote twice!\\u201d to remind voters to vote in both the special election primary to replace former Rep. Katie Hill and the primary for a full term, which are both happening on March 3. Smith, a state assemblywoman, told CQ Roll Call in an interview that her finance director was initially joking around when she came up with the tagline. But Smith and her campaign decided it could resonate with voters. The slogan is about \\u201cmaking sure that voters understand that it is not only acceptable, but we\\u2019d really prefer that they do vote twice,\\u201d Smith said with a laugh.\\n\\nMontana isn\\u2019t a competitive part of the Senate battlefield \\u2014 yet. Inside Elections rates GOP Sen. Steve Daines\\u2019 reelection Solid Republican. But despite electing Trump by 20 points in 2016, Montanans have a history of splitting their tickets. The same year they backed Trump, they reelected Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock by nearly 4 points. Two years later, they reelected Democratic Sen. Jon Tester by nearly 4 points \\u2014 the first time he won with more than 50 percent of the vote. Democrats also contested the at-large House seat. So even though Trump will almost certainly again carry Montana by double digits this year, Democrats haven\\u2019t given up on the 2020 Senate race.\\n\\nAll eyes remain on Bullock, who dropped his presidential bid in December and has repeatedly said he won\\u2019t run for Senate. But there\\u2019s still time. The filing deadline is March 9, about a week after the state party\\u2019s big Democratic dinner, where Bullock will likely feel some heat to run. If he stays out, Cora Neumann \\u2014 one of several Democrats already in the race \\u2014 could solidify party support in the June 2 primary. Neuman, who has a Ph.D. in public health and worked with the Global First Ladies Alliance and the State Department\\u2019s Economic Bureau, hasn\\u2019t yet filed numbers with the Federal Election Commission, but her campaign announced earlier this month it raised more than $460,000 between October and Dec. 31.

They can subscribe here.\\n\\nThe impeachment trial we\\u2019ve all been prognosticating about for weeks is finally here, in all its exhausting, late-night glory. And yet, on the campaign trail, the conversation remains largely unchanged. The biggest impact has been on senators running for president or facing competitive reelections back home. They have been sidelined in Washington, unable to attend fundraisers or even check their phones for hours on end.\\n\\nRepublicans continue to hammer vulnerable Democrats on impeachment, with the pro-Trump group America First Policies launching an attack ad against Alabama Democrat Doug Jones, the most vulnerable senator facing reelection in 2020. But Democrats still largely aren\\u2019t going there. While some national Democratic groups and even some Senate candidates are using impeachment in their fundraising emails, voters are likely to hear a lot more from them about prescription drug costs, Medicare and Social Security than impeachment, as the super PAC Priorities USA made clear in a memo this week.\\n\\nOne key state to watch: Maine, where a majority of likely voters thought President Donald Trump \\u201cabused\\u201d the power of his office, according to a poll conducted last week for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC allied with Senate Democrats. More than 70 percent of Mainers wanted the Senate to \\u201cinsist\\u201d on seeing fresh evidence and hearing from witnesses. GOP Sen. Susan Collins has already broken with her party on one vote this week \\u2014 she sided with Democrats to allow for more time to respond to motions made during the trial. But that doesn\\u2019t mean she\\u2019s going to break with Democrats on the big vote, or that it would necessarily benefit her politically to do so. Like her GOP peers in Arizona and Colorado, she needs to show moderates that she\\u2019s still an independent thinker while not alienating Trump\\u2019s base.\\n\\nIn the trial, off the trail: Senators running for president aren\\u2019t the only ones stuck in the chamber for the impeachment trial. So are vulnerable senators in both parties, whose campaigns have had to adjust to the proceedings, which keep these senators in the Capitol for hours on end.\\n\\n#CA25: This cycle, congressional candidates will have to compete with the presidential race for attention, money and TV time. But candidates running to replace former California Democratic Rep. Katie Hill face an additional challenge: reminding people that there are two elections in the same congressional district on the same day as Super Tuesday. The potential for voter confusion is raising concerns, and Democrats are trying to figure out what to do about it.\\n\\n2022 on the brain: Both parties are targeting six states this year because they want to control the redrawing of congressional maps following the 2020 census. CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Michael Macagnone and Jacob Fischler detail the fight for control of state legislatures that will decide on redistricting in a handful of key states.\\n\\nTrackers gonna track: The DCCC cried foul over the NRCC\\u2019s use of trackers recently, filing a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics. Democrats argue that Republicans\\u2019 use of trackers in House hallways to record vulnerable Democrats violates ethics rules that bar official resources from being used for campaigns. Ethics experts told CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Chris Marquette that the DCCC may have a point.\\n\\nWho\\u2019s that lady? A suburban mom named Stacy is getting a lot of attention for being upset about impeachment. But as we first noted last Friday, she seems to live in 11 different congressional districts. Now Jimmy Kimmel has picked up on her starring role in American Action Network\\u2019s ads, which are attacking House Democrats from Nevada to Maine. So just who are the people who appear in campaign ads \\u2014 and how much do political groups have to identify them? Revisit our 2018 explainer.\\n\\nEndorsements: Members of Congress continued to take sides in the presidential race. Joe Biden nabbed five more House endorsements: Alabama\\u2019s Terri A. Sewell, Florida\\u2019s Frederica Wilson and Alcee L. Hastings, Georgia\\u2019s Sanford D. Bishop and New Jersey\\u2019s Donald M. Payne Jr. (One bonus Biden endorsement that\\u2019s Congress-adjacent: New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen\\u2019s husband Bill Shaheen, a DNC member, backed the former VP). Three House lawmakers endorsed Mike Bloomberg: California\\u2019s Harley Rouda, Florida\\u2019s Stephanie Murphy and Illinois\\u2019 Bobby L. Rush. And leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus split over the more liberal candidates in the race. Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal endorsed Bernie Sanders and Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin backed Elizabeth Warren.\\n\\nOh Kay: After taking a few years off from taking on sitting House Republicans, the conservative Club for Growth is taking aim at Texas GOP Rep. Kay Granger, Politico reported Thursday. The group is planning a TV, digital and mail campaign against the congresswoman, the top Republican on the powerful Appropriations Committee. Granger faces former Colleyville City Councilmember Chris Putnam in the March 3 primary, and he\\u2019s been putting up a fight so far. The Texas Tribune has a good primer on the race.\\n\\nGOP $$$: NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer recently lowered expectations for Republican fundraising. But some House Republicans have figured out how to raise eye-popping numbers, including two who have leveraged their national profiles. Texas Rep. Daniel Crenshaw\\u2019s campaign told the Houston Chronicle that the freshman lawmaker raised $1.6 million in the final fundraising quarter of 2019. And former House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes raised $2.1 million in the quarter, according to the Washington Examiner.\\n\\nJersey style: What was supposed to be one of New Jersey Democrat Josh Gottheimer\\u2019s tame diner chats with constituents turned contentious this week, when a former state Assembly speaker confronted the congressman over impeachment.\\n\\nTwo-way race: Labor lawyer Shannon Liss-Riordan dropped her primary bid in the Massachusetts Senate race, leaving Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III and incumbent Edward J. Markey in the Democratic race.\\n\\nThanks, but no thanks: Utah Republican Thom Carter says he won\\u2019t run for the GOP nod to challenge freshman Democrat Ben McAdams in the state\\u2019s swingy 4th District.

Inside Elections rates GOP Sen. Steve Daines\\u2019 reelection Solid Republican. But despite electing Trump by 20 points in 2016, Montanans have a history of splitting their tickets. The same year they backed Trump, they reelected Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock by nearly 4 points. Two years later, they reelected Democratic Sen. Jon Tester by nearly 4 points \\u2014 the first time he won with more than 50 percent of the vote. Democrats also contested the at-large House seat. So even though Trump will almost certainly again carry Montana by double digits this year, Democrats haven\\u2019t given up on the 2020 Senate race.\\n\\nAll eyes remain on Bullock, who dropped his presidential bid in December and has repeatedly said he won\\u2019t run for Senate. But there\\u2019s still time. The filing deadline is March 9, about a week after the state party\\u2019s big Democratic dinner, where Bullock will likely feel some heat to run. If he stays out, Cora Neumann \\u2014 one of several Democrats already in the race \\u2014 could solidify party support in the June 2 primary. Neuman, who has a Ph.D. in public health and worked with the Global First Ladies Alliance and the State Department\\u2019s Economic Bureau, hasn\\u2019t yet filed numbers with the Federal Election Commission, but her campaign announced earlier this month it raised more than $460,000 between October and Dec. 31. Daines starts with an edge, though, not the least of which is financial: He had $4.2 million in the bank at the end of September.\\n\\nFor next week, let us know if you\\u2019d like to learn more about the Arizona Senate race or the South Carolina Senate race.

Each week we\\u2019ll bring you news and analysis from the CQ Roll Call team that will keep you informed about the 2020 election. Know someone who\\u2019d like to get this newsletter? They can subscribe here.\\n\\nThe impeachment trial we\\u2019ve all been prognosticating about for weeks is finally here, in all its exhausting, late-night glory. And yet, on the campaign trail, the conversation remains largely unchanged. The biggest impact has been on senators running for president or facing competitive reelections back home. They have been sidelined in Washington, unable to attend fundraisers or even check their phones for hours on end.\\n\\nRepublicans continue to hammer vulnerable Democrats on impeachment, with the pro-Trump group America First Policies launching an attack ad against Alabama Democrat Doug Jones, the most vulnerable senator facing reelection in 2020. But Democrats still largely aren\\u2019t going there. While some national Democratic groups and even some Senate candidates are using impeachment in their fundraising emails, voters are likely to hear a lot more from them about prescription drug costs, Medicare and Social Security than impeachment, as the super PAC Priorities USA made clear in a memo this week.\\n\\nOne key state to watch: Maine, where a majority of likely voters thought President Donald Trump \\u201cabused\\u201d the power of his office, according to a poll conducted last week for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC allied with Senate Democrats. More than 70 percent of Mainers wanted the Senate to \\u201cinsist\\u201d on seeing fresh evidence and hearing from witnesses. GOP Sen. Susan Collins has already broken with her party on one vote this week \\u2014 she sided with Democrats to allow for more time to respond to motions made during the trial. But that doesn\\u2019t mean she\\u2019s going to break with Democrats on the big vote, or that it would necessarily benefit her politically to do so. Like her GOP peers in Arizona and Colorado, she needs to show moderates that she\\u2019s still an independent thinker while not alienating Trump\\u2019s base.\\n\\nIn the trial, off the trail: Senators running for president aren\\u2019t the only ones stuck in the chamber for the impeachment trial. So are vulnerable senators in both parties, whose campaigns have had to adjust to the proceedings, which keep these senators in the Capitol for hours on end.\\n\\n#CA25: This cycle, congressional candidates will have to compete with the presidential race for attention, money and TV time. But candidates running to replace former California Democratic Rep. Katie Hill face an additional challenge: reminding people that there are two elections in the same congressional district on the same day as Super Tuesday. The potential for voter confusion is raising concerns, and Democrats are trying to figure out what to do about it.\\n\\n2022 on the brain: Both parties are targeting six states this year because they want to control the redrawing of congressional maps following the 2020 census. CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Michael Macagnone and Jacob Fischler detail the fight for control of state legislatures that will decide on redistricting in a handful of key states.\\n\\nTrackers gonna track: The DCCC cried foul over the NRCC\\u2019s use of trackers recently, filing a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics. Democrats argue that Republicans\\u2019 use of trackers in House hallways to record vulnerable Democrats violates ethics rules that bar official resources from being used for campaigns. Ethics experts told CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Chris Marquette that the DCCC may have a point.\\n\\nWho\\u2019s that lady? A suburban mom named Stacy is getting a lot of attention for being upset about impeachment. But as we first noted last Friday, she seems to live in 11 different congressional districts. Now Jimmy Kimmel has picked up on her starring role in American Action Network\\u2019s ads, which are attacking House Democrats from Nevada to Maine. So just who are the people who appear in campaign ads \\u2014 and how much do political groups have to identify them? Revisit our 2018 explainer.\\n\\nEndorsements: Members of Congress continued to take sides in the presidential race. Joe Biden nabbed five more House endorsements: Alabama\\u2019s Terri A. Sewell, Florida\\u2019s Frederica Wilson and Alcee L. Hastings, Georgia\\u2019s Sanford D. Bishop and New Jersey\\u2019s Donald M. Payne Jr. (One bonus Biden endorsement that\\u2019s Congress-adjacent: New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen\\u2019s husband Bill Shaheen, a DNC member, backed the former VP). Three House lawmakers endorsed Mike Bloomberg: California\\u2019s Harley Rouda, Florida\\u2019s Stephanie Murphy and Illinois\\u2019 Bobby L. Rush. And leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus split over the more liberal candidates in the race. Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal endorsed Bernie Sanders and Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin backed Elizabeth Warren.\\n\\nOh Kay: After taking a few years off from taking on sitting House Republicans, the conservative Club for Growth is taking aim at Texas GOP Rep. Kay Granger, Politico reported Thursday. The group is planning a TV, digital and mail campaign against the congresswoman, the top Republican on the powerful Appropriations Committee. Granger faces former Colleyville City Councilmember Chris Putnam in the March 3 primary, and he\\u2019s been putting up a fight so far. The Texas Tribune has a good primer on the race.\\n\\nGOP $$$: NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer recently lowered expectations for Republican fundraising. But some House Republicans have figured out how to raise eye-popping numbers, including two who have leveraged their national profiles. Texas Rep. Daniel Crenshaw\\u2019s campaign told the Houston Chronicle that the freshman lawmaker raised $1.6 million in the final fundraising quarter of 2019. And former House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes raised $2.1 million in the quarter, according to the Washington Examiner.\\n\\nJersey style: What was supposed to be one of New Jersey Democrat Josh Gottheimer\\u2019s tame diner chats with constituents turned contentious this week, when a former state Assembly speaker confronted the congressman over impeachment.\\n\\nTwo-way race: Labor lawyer Shannon Liss-Riordan dropped her primary bid in the Massachusetts Senate race, leaving Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III and incumbent Edward J. Markey in the Democratic race.\\n\\nThanks, but no thanks: Utah Republican Thom Carter says he won\\u2019t run for the GOP nod to challenge freshman Democrat Ben McAdams in the state\\u2019s swingy 4th District. Carter, the executive director of the Utah Clean Air Partnership, said national Republicans had been recruiting him amid concerns about the caliber of current candidates in the crowded primary.\\n\\nTaking sides: Main Street Partnership PAC became the first national group to back one of Iowa GOP Rep. Steve King\\u2019s top primary challengers: state Sen. Randy Feenstra. King has been sidelined in the House due to racist comments, and Feenstra, the top GOP fundraiser so far, is one of five Republicans who have filed to challenge the nine-term congressman. Main Street Partnership PAC, which describes itself as supportive of the \\u201cgoverning\\u201d wing of the GOP, backed three other House candidates this week: Chele Farley in New York\\u2019s 18th District, Amanda Makki in Florida\\u2019s 13th and Sue Rezin in Illinois\\u2019 14th.\\n\\nIowa! (but not about the caucuses): Stu Rothenberg dives into Trump\\u2019s prospects of winning Iowa in 2020.\\n\\nIowa! (OK, this one\\u2019s about the caucuses): The Iowa caucuses are less than two weeks away, people! The Associated Press has a roundup of how presidential candidates (especially those stuck in D.C. for the impeachment trial) are deploying their surrogates throughout the state. We explained in December how being able to tap someone who knows how to make a political pitch to a crowd is one of the values of getting House and Senate members to endorse you.\\n\\n#AZSEN: National Journal\\u2019s Josh Kraushaar writes that Arizona GOP Sen. Martha McSally\\u2019s approach to her 2020 race signals she hasn\\u2019t learned the lessons of her 2018 loss. \\u201cHer base-first approach to politics is a sign of weakness, for a candidate furiously trying to generate support in the worst possible way,\\u201d he writes.\\n\\nOK, Bloomer: It\\u2019s no secret that Bloomberg has been blanketing the airwaves with ads for his presidential run. But his strategy could jack up ad prices for everyone else, Politico reports.\\n\\nRest your head: Mike Lindell has been a fixture on the Midwestern campaign trail for Trump and down-ballot Republicans over the past few years. Now the MyPillow founder \\u201cis becoming less coy about his political future\\u201d in Minnesota, the Star Tribune\\u2019s Stephen Montemayor writes.\\n\\nTryin\\u2019 Ryan?: Ohio radio station WKSU takes a look at the 7-way GOP primary in the 13th District, currently occupied by failed 2020 presidential candidate Rep. Tim Ryan, and concludes the Democrat could be up against one of the toughest elections of his career.\\n\\nUmm \\u2026 ew: William Figlesthaler, who is vying for the GOP nomination for retiring Florida Rep. Francis Rooney\\u2019s seat, put his name on \\u201cDrain the Swamp\\u201d urinal screens at the 7,000-seat Hertz Arena. At least he didn\\u2019t use his picture.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s the number of bills and joint resolutions lawmakers introduced in 2019 \\u2014 23 percent more than in 2017, the first year of the previous Congress. That show of initiative might be surprising given how little actually becomes law, but as CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Mike Teitelbaum explains, there can be other incentives to introducing legislation, especially for House freshmen.\\n\\nWas Hillary Clinton a terrible candidate? That\\u2019s the question Nathan L. Gonzales tries to answer with the \\u201cVote Above Replacement\\u201d metric developed for Inside Elections.\\n\\nIn California\\u2019s 25th District, Democrat Christy Smith is using the tagline, \\u201cFor once in your life, vote twice!\\u201d to remind voters to vote in both the special election primary to replace former Rep. Katie Hill and the primary for a full term, which are both happening on March 3. Smith, a state assemblywoman, told CQ Roll Call in an interview that her finance director was initially joking around when she came up with the tagline. But Smith and her campaign decided it could resonate with voters. The slogan is about \\u201cmaking sure that voters understand that it is not only acceptable, but we\\u2019d really prefer that they do vote twice,\\u201d Smith said with a laugh.\\n\\nMontana isn\\u2019t a competitive part of the Senate battlefield \\u2014 yet.

More than 70 percent of Mainers wanted the Senate to \\u201cinsist\\u201d on seeing fresh evidence and hearing from witnesses. GOP Sen. Susan Collins has already broken with her party on one vote this week \\u2014 she sided with Democrats to allow for more time to respond to motions made during the trial. But that doesn\\u2019t mean she\\u2019s going to break with Democrats on the big vote, or that it would necessarily benefit her politically to do so. Like her GOP peers in Arizona and Colorado, she needs to show moderates that she\\u2019s still an independent thinker while not alienating Trump\\u2019s base.\\n\\nIn the trial, off the trail: Senators running for president aren\\u2019t the only ones stuck in the chamber for the impeachment trial. So are vulnerable senators in both parties, whose campaigns have had to adjust to the proceedings, which keep these senators in the Capitol for hours on end.\\n\\n#CA25: This cycle, congressional candidates will have to compete with the presidential race for attention, money and TV time. But candidates running to replace former California Democratic Rep. Katie Hill face an additional challenge: reminding people that there are two elections in the same congressional district on the same day as Super Tuesday. The potential for voter confusion is raising concerns, and Democrats are trying to figure out what to do about it.\\n\\n2022 on the brain: Both parties are targeting six states this year because they want to control the redrawing of congressional maps following the 2020 census. CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Michael Macagnone and Jacob Fischler detail the fight for control of state legislatures that will decide on redistricting in a handful of key states.\\n\\nTrackers gonna track: The DCCC cried foul over the NRCC\\u2019s use of trackers recently, filing a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics. Democrats argue that Republicans\\u2019 use of trackers in House hallways to record vulnerable Democrats violates ethics rules that bar official resources from being used for campaigns. Ethics experts told CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Chris Marquette that the DCCC may have a point.\\n\\nWho\\u2019s that lady? A suburban mom named Stacy is getting a lot of attention for being upset about impeachment. But as we first noted last Friday, she seems to live in 11 different congressional districts. Now Jimmy Kimmel has picked up on her starring role in American Action Network\\u2019s ads, which are attacking House Democrats from Nevada to Maine. So just who are the people who appear in campaign ads \\u2014 and how much do political groups have to identify them? Revisit our 2018 explainer.\\n\\nEndorsements: Members of Congress continued to take sides in the presidential race. Joe Biden nabbed five more House endorsements: Alabama\\u2019s Terri A. Sewell, Florida\\u2019s Frederica Wilson and Alcee L. Hastings, Georgia\\u2019s Sanford D. Bishop and New Jersey\\u2019s Donald M. Payne Jr. (One bonus Biden endorsement that\\u2019s Congress-adjacent: New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen\\u2019s husband Bill Shaheen, a DNC member, backed the former VP). Three House lawmakers endorsed Mike Bloomberg: California\\u2019s Harley Rouda, Florida\\u2019s Stephanie Murphy and Illinois\\u2019 Bobby L. Rush. And leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus split over the more liberal candidates in the race. Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal endorsed Bernie Sanders and Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin backed Elizabeth Warren.\\n\\nOh Kay: After taking a few years off from taking on sitting House Republicans, the conservative Club for Growth is taking aim at Texas GOP Rep. Kay Granger, Politico reported Thursday. The group is planning a TV, digital and mail campaign against the congresswoman, the top Republican on the powerful Appropriations Committee. Granger faces former Colleyville City Councilmember Chris Putnam in the March 3 primary, and he\\u2019s been putting up a fight so far. The Texas Tribune has a good primer on the race.\\n\\nGOP $$$: NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer recently lowered expectations for Republican fundraising. But some House Republicans have figured out how to raise eye-popping numbers, including two who have leveraged their national profiles. Texas Rep. Daniel Crenshaw\\u2019s campaign told the Houston Chronicle that the freshman lawmaker raised $1.6 million in the final fundraising quarter of 2019. And former House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes raised $2.1 million in the quarter, according to the Washington Examiner.\\n\\nJersey style: What was supposed to be one of New Jersey Democrat Josh Gottheimer\\u2019s tame diner chats with constituents turned contentious this week, when a former state Assembly speaker confronted the congressman over impeachment.\\n\\nTwo-way race: Labor lawyer Shannon Liss-Riordan dropped her primary bid in the Massachusetts Senate race, leaving Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III and incumbent Edward J. Markey in the Democratic race.\\n\\nThanks, but no thanks: Utah Republican Thom Carter says he won\\u2019t run for the GOP nod to challenge freshman Democrat Ben McAdams in the state\\u2019s swingy 4th District. Carter, the executive director of the Utah Clean Air Partnership, said national Republicans had been recruiting him amid concerns about the caliber of current candidates in the crowded primary.\\n\\nTaking sides: Main Street Partnership PAC became the first national group to back one of Iowa GOP Rep. Steve King\\u2019s top primary challengers: state Sen. Randy Feenstra. King has been sidelined in the House due to racist comments, and Feenstra, the top GOP fundraiser so far, is one of five Republicans who have filed to challenge the nine-term congressman. Main Street Partnership PAC, which describes itself as supportive of the \\u201cgoverning\\u201d wing of the GOP, backed three other House candidates this week: Chele Farley in New York\\u2019s 18th District, Amanda Makki in Florida\\u2019s 13th and Sue Rezin in Illinois\\u2019 14th.\\n\\nIowa! (but not about the caucuses): Stu Rothenberg dives into Trump\\u2019s prospects of winning Iowa in 2020.\\n\\nIowa! (OK, this one\\u2019s about the caucuses): The Iowa caucuses are less than two weeks away, people! The Associated Press has a roundup of how presidential candidates (especially those stuck in D.C. for the impeachment trial) are deploying their surrogates throughout the state. We explained in December how being able to tap someone who knows how to make a political pitch to a crowd is one of the values of getting House and Senate members to endorse you.\\n\\n#AZSEN: National Journal\\u2019s Josh Kraushaar writes that Arizona GOP Sen. Martha McSally\\u2019s approach to her 2020 race signals she hasn\\u2019t learned the lessons of her 2018 loss. \\u201cHer base-first approach to politics is a sign of weakness, for a candidate furiously trying to generate support in the worst possible way,\\u201d he writes.\\n\\nOK, Bloomer: It\\u2019s no secret that Bloomberg has been blanketing the airwaves with ads for his presidential run. But his strategy could jack up ad prices for everyone else, Politico reports.\\n\\nRest your head: Mike Lindell has been a fixture on the Midwestern campaign trail for Trump and down-ballot Republicans over the past few years. Now the MyPillow founder \\u201cis becoming less coy about his political future\\u201d in Minnesota, the Star Tribune\\u2019s Stephen Montemayor writes.\\n\\nTryin\\u2019 Ryan?: Ohio radio station WKSU takes a look at the 7-way GOP primary in the 13th District, currently occupied by failed 2020 presidential candidate Rep. Tim Ryan, and concludes the Democrat could be up against one of the toughest elections of his career.\\n\\nUmm \\u2026 ew: William Figlesthaler, who is vying for the GOP nomination for retiring Florida Rep. Francis Rooney\\u2019s seat, put his name on \\u201cDrain the Swamp\\u201d urinal screens at the 7,000-seat Hertz Arena. At least he didn\\u2019t use his picture.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s the number of bills and joint resolutions lawmakers introduced in 2019 \\u2014 23 percent more than in 2017, the first year of the previous Congress. That show of initiative might be surprising given how little actually becomes law, but as CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Mike Teitelbaum explains, there can be other incentives to introducing legislation, especially for House freshmen.\\n\\nWas Hillary Clinton a terrible candidate? That\\u2019s the question Nathan L. Gonzales tries to answer with the \\u201cVote Above Replacement\\u201d metric developed for Inside Elections.\\n\\nIn California\\u2019s 25th District, Democrat Christy Smith is using the tagline, \\u201cFor once in your life, vote twice!\\u201d to remind voters to vote in both the special election primary to replace former Rep. Katie Hill and the primary for a full term, which are both happening on March 3. Smith, a state assemblywoman, told CQ Roll Call in an interview that her finance director was initially joking around when she came up with the tagline. But Smith and her campaign decided it could resonate with voters. The slogan is about \\u201cmaking sure that voters understand that it is not only acceptable, but we\\u2019d really prefer that they do vote twice,\\u201d Smith said with a laugh.\\n\\nMontana isn\\u2019t a competitive part of the Senate battlefield \\u2014 yet. Inside Elections rates GOP Sen. Steve Daines\\u2019 reelection Solid Republican. But despite electing Trump by 20 points in 2016, Montanans have a history of splitting their tickets. The same year they backed Trump, they reelected Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock by nearly 4 points. Two years later, they reelected Democratic Sen. Jon Tester by nearly 4 points \\u2014 the first time he won with more than 50 percent of the vote. Democrats also contested the at-large House seat. So even though Trump will almost certainly again carry Montana by double digits this year, Democrats haven\\u2019t given up on the 2020 Senate race.\\n\\nAll eyes remain on Bullock, who dropped his presidential bid in December and has repeatedly said he won\\u2019t run for Senate. But there\\u2019s still time. The filing deadline is March 9, about a week after the state party\\u2019s big Democratic dinner, where Bullock will likely feel some heat to run. If he stays out, Cora Neumann \\u2014 one of several Democrats already in the race \\u2014 could solidify party support in the June 2 primary. Neuman, who has a Ph.D. in public health and worked with the Global First Ladies Alliance and the State Department\\u2019s Economic Bureau, hasn\\u2019t yet filed numbers with the Federal Election Commission, but her campaign announced earlier this month it raised more than $460,000 between October and Dec. 31. Daines starts with an edge, though, not the least of which is financial: He had $4.2 million in the bank at the end of September.\\n\\nFor next week, let us know if you\\u2019d like to learn more about the Arizona Senate race or the South Carolina Senate race. Email us at attheraces@cqrollcall.com.\\n\\nOne week before the Iowa caucuses, the Democratic presidential candidates will get their own town halls on CNN.

Daniel Crenshaw\\u2019s campaign told the Houston Chronicle that the freshman lawmaker raised $1.6 million in the final fundraising quarter of 2019. And former House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes raised $2.1 million in the quarter, according to the Washington Examiner.\\n\\nJersey style: What was supposed to be one of New Jersey Democrat Josh Gottheimer\\u2019s tame diner chats with constituents turned contentious this week, when a former state Assembly speaker confronted the congressman over impeachment.\\n\\nTwo-way race: Labor lawyer Shannon Liss-Riordan dropped her primary bid in the Massachusetts Senate race, leaving Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III and incumbent Edward J. Markey in the Democratic race.\\n\\nThanks, but no thanks: Utah Republican Thom Carter says he won\\u2019t run for the GOP nod to challenge freshman Democrat Ben McAdams in the state\\u2019s swingy 4th District. Carter, the executive director of the Utah Clean Air Partnership, said national Republicans had been recruiting him amid concerns about the caliber of current candidates in the crowded primary.\\n\\nTaking sides: Main Street Partnership PAC became the first national group to back one of Iowa GOP Rep. Steve King\\u2019s top primary challengers: state Sen. Randy Feenstra. King has been sidelined in the House due to racist comments, and Feenstra, the top GOP fundraiser so far, is one of five Republicans who have filed to challenge the nine-term congressman. Main Street Partnership PAC, which describes itself as supportive of the \\u201cgoverning\\u201d wing of the GOP, backed three other House candidates this week: Chele Farley in New York\\u2019s 18th District, Amanda Makki in Florida\\u2019s 13th and Sue Rezin in Illinois\\u2019 14th.\\n\\nIowa! (but not about the caucuses): Stu Rothenberg dives into Trump\\u2019s prospects of winning Iowa in 2020.\\n\\nIowa! (OK, this one\\u2019s about the caucuses): The Iowa caucuses are less than two weeks away, people! The Associated Press has a roundup of how presidential candidates (especially those stuck in D.C. for the impeachment trial) are deploying their surrogates throughout the state. We explained in December how being able to tap someone who knows how to make a political pitch to a crowd is one of the values of getting House and Senate members to endorse you.\\n\\n#AZSEN: National Journal\\u2019s Josh Kraushaar writes that Arizona GOP Sen. Martha McSally\\u2019s approach to her 2020 race signals she hasn\\u2019t learned the lessons of her 2018 loss. \\u201cHer base-first approach to politics is a sign of weakness, for a candidate furiously trying to generate support in the worst possible way,\\u201d he writes.\\n\\nOK, Bloomer: It\\u2019s no secret that Bloomberg has been blanketing the airwaves with ads for his presidential run. But his strategy could jack up ad prices for everyone else, Politico reports.\\n\\nRest your head: Mike Lindell has been a fixture on the Midwestern campaign trail for Trump and down-ballot Republicans over the past few years. Now the MyPillow founder \\u201cis becoming less coy about his political future\\u201d in Minnesota, the Star Tribune\\u2019s Stephen Montemayor writes.\\n\\nTryin\\u2019 Ryan?: Ohio radio station WKSU takes a look at the 7-way GOP primary in the 13th District, currently occupied by failed 2020 presidential candidate Rep. Tim Ryan, and concludes the Democrat could be up against one of the toughest elections of his career.\\n\\nUmm \\u2026 ew: William Figlesthaler, who is vying for the GOP nomination for retiring Florida Rep. Francis Rooney\\u2019s seat, put his name on \\u201cDrain the Swamp\\u201d urinal screens at the 7,000-seat Hertz Arena. At least he didn\\u2019t use his picture.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s the number of bills and joint resolutions lawmakers introduced in 2019 \\u2014 23 percent more than in 2017, the first year of the previous Congress. That show of initiative might be surprising given how little actually becomes law, but as CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Mike Teitelbaum explains, there can be other incentives to introducing legislation, especially for House freshmen.\\n\\nWas Hillary Clinton a terrible candidate? That\\u2019s the question Nathan L. Gonzales tries to answer with the \\u201cVote Above Replacement\\u201d metric developed for Inside Elections.\\n\\nIn California\\u2019s 25th District, Democrat Christy Smith is using the tagline, \\u201cFor once in your life, vote twice!\\u201d to remind voters to vote in both the special election primary to replace former Rep. Katie Hill and the primary for a full term, which are both happening on March 3. Smith, a state assemblywoman, told CQ Roll Call in an interview that her finance director was initially joking around when she came up with the tagline. But Smith and her campaign decided it could resonate with voters. The slogan is about \\u201cmaking sure that voters understand that it is not only acceptable, but we\\u2019d really prefer that they do vote twice,\\u201d Smith said with a laugh.\\n\\nMontana isn\\u2019t a competitive part of the Senate battlefield \\u2014 yet. Inside Elections rates GOP Sen. Steve Daines\\u2019 reelection Solid Republican. But despite electing Trump by 20 points in 2016, Montanans have a history of splitting their tickets. The same year they backed Trump, they reelected Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock by nearly 4 points. Two years later, they reelected Democratic Sen. Jon Tester by nearly 4 points \\u2014 the first time he won with more than 50 percent of the vote. Democrats also contested the at-large House seat. So even though Trump will almost certainly again carry Montana by double digits this year, Democrats haven\\u2019t given up on the 2020 Senate race.\\n\\nAll eyes remain on Bullock, who dropped his presidential bid in December and has repeatedly said he won\\u2019t run for Senate. But there\\u2019s still time. The filing deadline is March 9, about a week after the state party\\u2019s big Democratic dinner, where Bullock will likely feel some heat to run. If he stays out, Cora Neumann \\u2014 one of several Democrats already in the race \\u2014 could solidify party support in the June 2 primary. Neuman, who has a Ph.D. in public health and worked with the Global First Ladies Alliance and the State Department\\u2019s Economic Bureau, hasn\\u2019t yet filed numbers with the Federal Election Commission, but her campaign announced earlier this month it raised more than $460,000 between October and Dec. 31. Daines starts with an edge, though, not the least of which is financial: He had $4.2 million in the bank at the end of September.\\n\\nFor next week, let us know if you\\u2019d like to learn more about the Arizona Senate race or the South Carolina Senate race.

They can subscribe here.\\n\\nThe impeachment trial we\\u2019ve all been prognosticating about for weeks is finally here, in all its exhausting, late-night glory. And yet, on the campaign trail, the conversation remains largely unchanged. The biggest impact has been on senators running for president or facing competitive reelections back home. They have been sidelined in Washington, unable to attend fundraisers or even check their phones for hours on end.\\n\\nRepublicans continue to hammer vulnerable Democrats on impeachment, with the pro-Trump group America First Policies launching an attack ad against Alabama Democrat Doug Jones, the most vulnerable senator facing reelection in 2020. But Democrats still largely aren\\u2019t going there. While some national Democratic groups and even some Senate candidates are using impeachment in their fundraising emails, voters are likely to hear a lot more from them about prescription drug costs, Medicare and Social Security than impeachment, as the super PAC Priorities USA made clear in a memo this week.\\n\\nOne key state to watch: Maine, where a majority of likely voters thought President Donald Trump \\u201cabused\\u201d the power of his office, according to a poll conducted last week for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC allied with Senate Democrats. More than 70 percent of Mainers wanted the Senate to \\u201cinsist\\u201d on seeing fresh evidence and hearing from witnesses. GOP Sen. Susan Collins has already broken with her party on one vote this week \\u2014 she sided with Democrats to allow for more time to respond to motions made during the trial. But that doesn\\u2019t mean she\\u2019s going to break with Democrats on the big vote, or that it would necessarily benefit her politically to do so. Like her GOP peers in Arizona and Colorado, she needs to show moderates that she\\u2019s still an independent thinker while not alienating Trump\\u2019s base.\\n\\nIn the trial, off the trail: Senators running for president aren\\u2019t the only ones stuck in the chamber for the impeachment trial. So are vulnerable senators in both parties, whose campaigns have had to adjust to the proceedings, which keep these senators in the Capitol for hours on end.\\n\\n#CA25: This cycle, congressional candidates will have to compete with the presidential race for attention, money and TV time. But candidates running to replace former California Democratic Rep. Katie Hill face an additional challenge: reminding people that there are two elections in the same congressional district on the same day as Super Tuesday. The potential for voter confusion is raising concerns, and Democrats are trying to figure out what to do about it.\\n\\n2022 on the brain: Both parties are targeting six states this year because they want to control the redrawing of congressional maps following the 2020 census. CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Michael Macagnone and Jacob Fischler detail the fight for control of state legislatures that will decide on redistricting in a handful of key states.\\n\\nTrackers gonna track: The DCCC cried foul over the NRCC\\u2019s use of trackers recently, filing a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics. Democrats argue that Republicans\\u2019 use of trackers in House hallways to record vulnerable Democrats violates ethics rules that bar official resources from being used for campaigns. Ethics experts told CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Chris Marquette that the DCCC may have a point.\\n\\nWho\\u2019s that lady? A suburban mom named Stacy is getting a lot of attention for being upset about impeachment. But as we first noted last Friday, she seems to live in 11 different congressional districts. Now Jimmy Kimmel has picked up on her starring role in American Action Network\\u2019s ads, which are attacking House Democrats from Nevada to Maine. So just who are the people who appear in campaign ads \\u2014 and how much do political groups have to identify them? Revisit our 2018 explainer.\\n\\nEndorsements: Members of Congress continued to take sides in the presidential race. Joe Biden nabbed five more House endorsements: Alabama\\u2019s Terri A. Sewell, Florida\\u2019s Frederica Wilson and Alcee L. Hastings, Georgia\\u2019s Sanford D. Bishop and New Jersey\\u2019s Donald M. Payne Jr. (One bonus Biden endorsement that\\u2019s Congress-adjacent: New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen\\u2019s husband Bill Shaheen, a DNC member, backed the former VP). Three House lawmakers endorsed Mike Bloomberg: California\\u2019s Harley Rouda, Florida\\u2019s Stephanie Murphy and Illinois\\u2019 Bobby L. Rush. And leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus split over the more liberal candidates in the race. Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal endorsed Bernie Sanders and Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin backed Elizabeth Warren.\\n\\nOh Kay: After taking a few years off from taking on sitting House Republicans, the conservative Club for Growth is taking aim at Texas GOP Rep. Kay Granger, Politico reported Thursday. The group is planning a TV, digital and mail campaign against the congresswoman, the top Republican on the powerful Appropriations Committee. Granger faces former Colleyville City Councilmember Chris Putnam in the March 3 primary, and he\\u2019s been putting up a fight so far.

That show of initiative might be surprising given how little actually becomes law, but as CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Mike Teitelbaum explains, there can be other incentives to introducing legislation, especially for House freshmen.\\n\\nWas Hillary Clinton a terrible candidate? That\\u2019s the question Nathan L. Gonzales tries to answer with the \\u201cVote Above Replacement\\u201d metric developed for Inside Elections.\\n\\nIn California\\u2019s 25th District, Democrat Christy Smith is using the tagline, \\u201cFor once in your life, vote twice!\\u201d to remind voters to vote in both the special election primary to replace former Rep. Katie Hill and the primary for a full term, which are both happening on March 3. Smith, a state assemblywoman, told CQ Roll Call in an interview that her finance director was initially joking around when she came up with the tagline. But Smith and her campaign decided it could resonate with voters. The slogan is about \\u201cmaking sure that voters understand that it is not only acceptable, but we\\u2019d really prefer that they do vote twice,\\u201d Smith said with a laugh.\\n\\nMontana isn\\u2019t a competitive part of the Senate battlefield \\u2014 yet. Inside Elections rates GOP Sen. Steve Daines\\u2019 reelection Solid Republican. But despite electing Trump by 20 points in 2016, Montanans have a history of splitting their tickets. The same year they backed Trump, they reelected Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock by nearly 4 points. Two years later, they reelected Democratic Sen. Jon Tester by nearly 4 points \\u2014 the first time he won with more than 50 percent of the vote. Democrats also contested the at-large House seat. So even though Trump will almost certainly again carry Montana by double digits this year, Democrats haven\\u2019t given up on the 2020 Senate race.\\n\\nAll eyes remain on Bullock, who dropped his presidential bid in December and has repeatedly said he won\\u2019t run for Senate. But there\\u2019s still time. The filing deadline is March 9, about a week after the state party\\u2019s big Democratic dinner, where Bullock will likely feel some heat to run. If he stays out, Cora Neumann \\u2014 one of several Democrats already in the race \\u2014 could solidify party support in the June 2 primary. Neuman, who has a Ph.D. in public health and worked with the Global First Ladies Alliance and the State Department\\u2019s Economic Bureau, hasn\\u2019t yet filed numbers with the Federal Election Commission, but her campaign announced earlier this month it raised more than $460,000 between October and Dec. 31. Daines starts with an edge, though, not the least of which is financial: He had $4.2 million in the bank at the end of September.\\n\\nFor next week, let us know if you\\u2019d like to learn more about the Arizona Senate race or the South Carolina Senate race. Email us at attheraces@cqrollcall.com.\\n\\nOne week before the Iowa caucuses, the Democratic presidential candidates will get their own town halls on CNN.

Each week we\\u2019ll bring you news and analysis from the CQ Roll Call team that will keep you informed about the 2020 election. Know someone who\\u2019d like to get this newsletter? They can subscribe here.\\n\\nThe impeachment trial we\\u2019ve all been prognosticating about for weeks is finally here, in all its exhausting, late-night glory. And yet, on the campaign trail, the conversation remains largely unchanged. The biggest impact has been on senators running for president or facing competitive reelections back home. They have been sidelined in Washington, unable to attend fundraisers or even check their phones for hours on end.\\n\\nRepublicans continue to hammer vulnerable Democrats on impeachment, with the pro-Trump group America First Policies launching an attack ad against Alabama Democrat Doug Jones, the most vulnerable senator facing reelection in 2020. But Democrats still largely aren\\u2019t going there. While some national Democratic groups and even some Senate candidates are using impeachment in their fundraising emails, voters are likely to hear a lot more from them about prescription drug costs, Medicare and Social Security than impeachment, as the super PAC Priorities USA made clear in a memo this week.\\n\\nOne key state to watch: Maine, where a majority of likely voters thought President Donald Trump \\u201cabused\\u201d the power of his office, according to a poll conducted last week for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC allied with Senate Democrats. More than 70 percent of Mainers wanted the Senate to \\u201cinsist\\u201d on seeing fresh evidence and hearing from witnesses. GOP Sen. Susan Collins has already broken with her party on one vote this week \\u2014 she sided with Democrats to allow for more time to respond to motions made during the trial. But that doesn\\u2019t mean she\\u2019s going to break with Democrats on the big vote, or that it would necessarily benefit her politically to do so. Like her GOP peers in Arizona and Colorado, she needs to show moderates that she\\u2019s still an independent thinker while not alienating Trump\\u2019s base.\\n\\nIn the trial, off the trail: Senators running for president aren\\u2019t the only ones stuck in the chamber for the impeachment trial. So are vulnerable senators in both parties, whose campaigns have had to adjust to the proceedings, which keep these senators in the Capitol for hours on end.\\n\\n#CA25: This cycle, congressional candidates will have to compete with the presidential race for attention, money and TV time. But candidates running to replace former California Democratic Rep. Katie Hill face an additional challenge: reminding people that there are two elections in the same congressional district on the same day as Super Tuesday. The potential for voter confusion is raising concerns, and Democrats are trying to figure out what to do about it.\\n\\n2022 on the brain: Both parties are targeting six states this year because they want to control the redrawing of congressional maps following the 2020 census. CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Michael Macagnone and Jacob Fischler detail the fight for control of state legislatures that will decide on redistricting in a handful of key states.\\n\\nTrackers gonna track: The DCCC cried foul over the NRCC\\u2019s use of trackers recently, filing a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics. Democrats argue that Republicans\\u2019 use of trackers in House hallways to record vulnerable Democrats violates ethics rules that bar official resources from being used for campaigns. Ethics experts told CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Chris Marquette that the DCCC may have a point.\\n\\nWho\\u2019s that lady? A suburban mom named Stacy is getting a lot of attention for being upset about impeachment. But as we first noted last Friday, she seems to live in 11 different congressional districts. Now Jimmy Kimmel has picked up on her starring role in American Action Network\\u2019s ads, which are attacking House Democrats from Nevada to Maine. So just who are the people who appear in campaign ads \\u2014 and how much do political groups have to identify them? Revisit our 2018 explainer.\\n\\nEndorsements: Members of Congress continued to take sides in the presidential race. Joe Biden nabbed five more House endorsements: Alabama\\u2019s Terri A. Sewell, Florida\\u2019s Frederica Wilson and Alcee L. Hastings, Georgia\\u2019s Sanford D. Bishop and New Jersey\\u2019s Donald M. Payne Jr. (One bonus Biden endorsement that\\u2019s Congress-adjacent: New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen\\u2019s husband Bill Shaheen, a DNC member, backed the former VP). Three House lawmakers endorsed Mike Bloomberg: California\\u2019s Harley Rouda, Florida\\u2019s Stephanie Murphy and Illinois\\u2019 Bobby L. Rush. And leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus split over the more liberal candidates in the race. Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal endorsed Bernie Sanders and Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin backed Elizabeth Warren.\\n\\nOh Kay: After taking a few years off from taking on sitting House Republicans, the conservative Club for Growth is taking aim at Texas GOP Rep. Kay Granger, Politico reported Thursday. The group is planning a TV, digital and mail campaign against the congresswoman, the top Republican on the powerful Appropriations Committee. Granger faces former Colleyville City Councilmember Chris Putnam in the March 3 primary, and he\\u2019s been putting up a fight so far. The Texas Tribune has a good primer on the race.\\n\\nGOP $$$: NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer recently lowered expectations for Republican fundraising. But some House Republicans have figured out how to raise eye-popping numbers, including two who have leveraged their national profiles. Texas Rep. Daniel Crenshaw\\u2019s campaign told the Houston Chronicle that the freshman lawmaker raised $1.6 million in the final fundraising quarter of 2019. And former House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes raised $2.1 million in the quarter, according to the Washington Examiner.\\n\\nJersey style: What was supposed to be one of New Jersey Democrat Josh Gottheimer\\u2019s tame diner chats with constituents turned contentious this week, when a former state Assembly speaker confronted the congressman over impeachment.\\n\\nTwo-way race: Labor lawyer Shannon Liss-Riordan dropped her primary bid in the Massachusetts Senate race, leaving Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III and incumbent Edward J. Markey in the Democratic race.\\n\\nThanks, but no thanks: Utah Republican Thom Carter says he won\\u2019t run for the GOP nod to challenge freshman Democrat Ben McAdams in the state\\u2019s swingy 4th District. Carter, the executive director of the Utah Clean Air Partnership, said national Republicans had been recruiting him amid concerns about the caliber of current candidates in the crowded primary.\\n\\nTaking sides: Main Street Partnership PAC became the first national group to back one of Iowa GOP Rep. Steve King\\u2019s top primary challengers: state Sen. Randy Feenstra. King has been sidelined in the House due to racist comments, and Feenstra, the top GOP fundraiser so far, is one of five Republicans who have filed to challenge the nine-term congressman. Main Street Partnership PAC, which describes itself as supportive of the \\u201cgoverning\\u201d wing of the GOP, backed three other House candidates this week: Chele Farley in New York\\u2019s 18th District, Amanda Makki in Florida\\u2019s 13th and Sue Rezin in Illinois\\u2019 14th.\\n\\nIowa! (but not about the caucuses): Stu Rothenberg dives into Trump\\u2019s prospects of winning Iowa in 2020.\\n\\nIowa! (OK, this one\\u2019s about the caucuses): The Iowa caucuses are less than two weeks away, people! The Associated Press has a roundup of how presidential candidates (especially those stuck in D.C. for the impeachment trial) are deploying their surrogates throughout the state. We explained in December how being able to tap someone who knows how to make a political pitch to a crowd is one of the values of getting House and Senate members to endorse you.\\n\\n#AZSEN: National Journal\\u2019s Josh Kraushaar writes that Arizona GOP Sen. Martha McSally\\u2019s approach to her 2020 race signals she hasn\\u2019t learned the lessons of her 2018 loss. \\u201cHer base-first approach to politics is a sign of weakness, for a candidate furiously trying to generate support in the worst possible way,\\u201d he writes.\\n\\nOK, Bloomer: It\\u2019s no secret that Bloomberg has been blanketing the airwaves with ads for his presidential run. But his strategy could jack up ad prices for everyone else, Politico reports.\\n\\nRest your head: Mike Lindell has been a fixture on the Midwestern campaign trail for Trump and down-ballot Republicans over the past few years. Now the MyPillow founder \\u201cis becoming less coy about his political future\\u201d in Minnesota, the Star Tribune\\u2019s Stephen Montemayor writes.\\n\\nTryin\\u2019 Ryan?: Ohio radio station WKSU takes a look at the 7-way GOP primary in the 13th District, currently occupied by failed 2020 presidential candidate Rep. Tim Ryan, and concludes the Democrat could be up against one of the toughest elections of his career.\\n\\nUmm \\u2026 ew: William Figlesthaler, who is vying for the GOP nomination for retiring Florida Rep. Francis Rooney\\u2019s seat, put his name on \\u201cDrain the Swamp\\u201d urinal screens at the 7,000-seat Hertz Arena. At least he didn\\u2019t use his picture.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s the number of bills and joint resolutions lawmakers introduced in 2019 \\u2014 23 percent more than in 2017, the first year of the previous Congress. That show of initiative might be surprising given how little actually becomes law, but as CQ Roll Call\\u2019s Mike Teitelbaum explains, there can be other incentives to introducing legislation, especially for House freshmen.\\n\\nWas Hillary Clinton a terrible candidate?

Normally bustling streets, shopping malls, restaurants and other public spaces in the city of 11 million were eerily quiet. Police checked all incoming vehicles but did not close off the roads.\\n\\nAuthorities announced similar measures would take effect Friday in the nearby cities of Huanggang and Ezhou. In Huanggang, theaters, internet cafes and other entertainment centers were also ordered closed.\\n\\nIn the capital, Beijing, officials canceled \\u201cmajor events\\u201d indefinitely, including traditional temple fairs that are a staple of holiday celebrations, in order to \\u201cexecute epidemic prevention and control.\\u201d The Forbidden City, the palace complex in Beijing that is now a museum, announced it will close indefinitely on Saturday.\\n\\nSeventeen people have died in the outbreak, all of them in and around Wuhan. Close to 600 have been infected, the vast majority of them in Wuhan, and many countries have begun screening travelers from China for symptoms of the virus, which can cause fever, coughing, trouble breathing and pneumonia.\\n\\nThe open-ended lockdowns are unprecedented in size, embracing more people than New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago combined.\\n\\nChinese officials have not said how long the shutdowns will last. While sweeping measures are typical of China\\u2019s communist government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world, even in deadly epidemics, because of concerns about infringing on people\\u2019s liberties. And the effectiveness of such measures is unclear.\\n\\n\\u201cTo my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people is new to science,\\u201d Gauden Galea, the World Health Organization\\u2019s representative in China, said in an interview. \\u201cIt has not been tried before as a public health measure.

He added: \\u201cYou have to make sure you communicate effectively about why this is being done. Otherwise you will lose the goodwill of the people.\\u201d\\n\\nDuring the devastating West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014, Sierra Leone imposed a national three-day quarantine as health teams went door-to-door searching for hidden cases. Frustrated residents complained of food shortages amid deserted streets. Burial teams collecting Ebola corpses and people transporting the sick to Ebola centers were the only ones allowed to move freely.\\n\\nIn China, the illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus first appeared last month in Wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub in central China\\u2019s Hubei province. Other cases have been reported in the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Thailand. Singapore, Vietnam and Hong Kong reported their first cases Thursday.\\n\\nMost of the illnesses outside China involve people who were from Wuhan or had recently traveled there.\\n\\nImages from Wuhan showed long lines and empty shelves at supermarkets, as residents stocked up for what could be weeks of isolation. That appeared to be an over-reaction, since no restrictions were placed on trucks carrying supplies into the city, although many Chinese have strong memories of shortages in the years before the country\\u2019s recent economic boom.\\n\\nLocal authorities in Wuhan demanded all residents wear masks in public places. Police, SWAT teams and paramilitary troops guarded Wuhan\\u2019s train station.\\n\\nLiu Haihan left Wuhan last Friday after visiting her boyfriend there. She said everything was normal then, before human-to-human transmission of the virus was confirmed. But things had changed rapidly.\\n\\nHer boyfriend \\u201cdidn\\u2019t sleep much yesterday. He disinfected his house and stocked up on instant noodles,\\u201d Liu said. \\u201cHe\\u2019s not really going out. If he does, he wears a mask.\\u201d\\n\\nThe sharp rise in illnesses comes as millions of Chinese travel for the Lunar New Year, one of the world\\u2019s largest annual migrations of people. Chinese are expected to take an estimated 3 billion trips during the 40-day spike in travel.\\n\\nAnalysts predicted cases will continue to multiply, although the jump in numbers is also attributable in part to increased monitoring.\\n\\n\\u201cEven if (cases) are in the thousands, this would not surprise us,\\u201d the WHO\\u2019s Galea said, adding, however, that the number of those infected is not an indicator of the outbreak\\u2019s severity, so long as the mortality rate remains low.\\n\\nThe coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the SARS outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which is thought to have originated from camels.\\n\\nChina is keen to avoid repeating mistakes with its handling of SARS. For months, even after the illness had spread around the world, China parked patients in hotels and drove them around in ambulances to conceal the true number of cases and avoid WHO experts.\\n\\nIn the current outbreak, China has been credited with sharing information rapidly, and President Xi Jinping has emphasized that as a priority.\\n\\n\\u201cParty committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels must put people\\u2019s lives and health first,\\u201d Xi said Monday. \\u201cIt is necessary to release epidemic information in a timely manner and deepen international cooperation.\\u201d\\n\\nHealth authorities were taking extraordinary measures to prevent additional person-to-person transmissions, placing those believed infected in plastic tubes and wheeled boxes, with air passed through filters.\\n\\nThe first cases in the Wuhan outbreak were connected to people who worked at or visited a seafood market, which has since been closed for an investigation. Experts suspect that the virus was first transmitted from wild animals but that it may also be mutating. Mutations can make it deadlier or more contagious.\\n\\nWHO convened its emergency committee of independent experts on Thursday to consider whether the outbreak should be declared a global health emergency, after the group failed to come to a consensus on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe U.N. health agency defines a global emergency as an \\u201cextraordinary event\\u201d that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.\\n\\nA declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel to and trade with affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease-reporting requirements on countries.\\n\\nDeclaring an international emergency can also be politically fraught. Countries typically resist the notion that they have a crisis within their borders and may argue strenuously for other control measures.\\n\\nAssociated Press journalists Shanshan Wang in Shanghai, Maria Cheng in London and Krista Larson in Dakar contributed to this report.\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DrudgeReportFeed/~3/i4kYqtvZvIQ/ed98662865c3c2eafc1733c827111ab2\", \"published\": \"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 15:58:37 GMT\", \"published_utc\": 1579813117, \"collection_utc\": 1579795290}",News,1579813117

Normally bustling streets, shopping malls, restaurants and other public spaces in the city of 11 million were eerily quiet. Police checked all incoming vehicles but did not close off the roads.\\n\\nAuthorities announced similar measures would take effect Friday in the nearby cities of Huanggang and Ezhou. In Huanggang, theaters, internet cafes and other entertainment centers were also ordered closed.\\n\\nIn the capital, Beijing, officials canceled \\u201cmajor events\\u201d indefinitely, including traditional temple fairs that are a staple of holiday celebrations, in order to \\u201cexecute epidemic prevention and control.\\u201d The Forbidden City, the palace complex in Beijing that is now a museum, announced it will close indefinitely on Saturday.\\n\\nSeventeen people have died in the outbreak, all of them in and around Wuhan. Close to 600 have been infected, the vast majority of them in Wuhan, and many countries have begun screening travelers from China for symptoms of the virus, which can cause fever, coughing, trouble breathing and pneumonia.\\n\\nThe open-ended lockdowns are unprecedented in size, embracing more people than New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago combined.\\n\\nChinese officials have not said how long the shutdowns will last. While sweeping measures are typical of China\\u2019s communist government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world, even in deadly epidemics, because of concerns about infringing on people\\u2019s liberties. And the effectiveness of such measures is unclear.\\n\\n\\u201cTo my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people is new to science,\\u201d Gauden Galea, the World Health Organization\\u2019s representative in China, said in an interview. \\u201cIt has not been tried before as a public health measure. We cannot at this stage say it will or it will not work.\\u201d\\n\\nJonathan Ball, a professor of virology at molecular virology at the University of Nottingham in Britain, said the lockdowns appear to be justified scientifically.\\n\\n\\u201cUntil there\\u2019s a better understanding of what the situation is, I think it\\u2019s not an unreasonable thing to do,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnything that limits people\\u2019s travels during an outbreak would obviously work.\\u201d\\n\\nBut Ball cautioned that any such quarantine should be strictly time-limited. He added: \\u201cYou have to make sure you communicate effectively about why this is being done. Otherwise you will lose the goodwill of the people.\\u201d\\n\\nDuring the devastating West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014, Sierra Leone imposed a national three-day quarantine as health teams went door-to-door searching for hidden cases. Frustrated residents complained of food shortages amid deserted streets. Burial teams collecting Ebola corpses and people transporting the sick to Ebola centers were the only ones allowed to move freely.\\n\\nIn China, the illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus first appeared last month in Wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub in central China\\u2019s Hubei province. Other cases have been reported in the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Thailand. Singapore, Vietnam and Hong Kong reported their first cases Thursday.\\n\\nMost of the illnesses outside China involve people who were from Wuhan or had recently traveled there.\\n\\nImages from Wuhan showed long lines and empty shelves at supermarkets, as residents stocked up for what could be weeks of isolation. That appeared to be an over-reaction, since no restrictions were placed on trucks carrying supplies into the city, although many Chinese have strong memories of shortages in the years before the country\\u2019s recent economic boom.\\n\\nLocal authorities in Wuhan demanded all residents wear masks in public places. Police, SWAT teams and paramilitary troops guarded Wuhan\\u2019s train station.\\n\\nLiu Haihan left Wuhan last Friday after visiting her boyfriend there.

That was followed by further threats by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to use the auto tariffs to punish European countries that tax American digital firms, further clouding the prospects for trade peace just days after France tendered an olive branch in the contentious fight over global tax rules.\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s discordant performance in Davos, where he took his \\u201cAmerica First\\u201d economic message to the very epicenter of the internationalist set, highlights the difficulties Europe will face this year in taming Trump\\u2019s unilateralist and protectionist instincts. While Europeans were quietly celebrating what seemed to them the rebirth of a multilateral approach to trade disputes\\u2014a little-noticed agreement this month with the United States and Japan to tackle industrial subsidies\\u2014Trump again railed against an international trade order he thinks is stacked against him and that he is steadily dismantling.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Trump declared that the United States is a \\u201cdeveloping nation,\\u201d in need of the same preferential treatment under World Trade Organization rules as China and India, and called for a massive reform of the quarter-century-old trading organization. And he again took aim at Europe\\u2019s alleged trade abuses, describing the European Union as a worse offender than China.\\n\\nAfter three years of steady, but still limited U.S. trade attacks on Europe\\u2014tariffs on steel and a host of other products, and a long-simmering fight over Europe\\u2019s support for Airbus\\u2014the EU is bracing this year to receive the full brunt of Trump\\u2019s trade anger.\\n\\n\\u201cThe European Union tried to gain some time, and had Washington focused on Beijing, but now we are on the menu ahead of the presidential election,\\u201d said Elvire Fabry, a trade expert at the Institut Jacques Delors in Paris. \\u201cTrump will expect to have some new scalps to show from the European side.\\u201d\\n\\nTrump may be emboldened by his relative success in browbeating Canada and Mexico to renegotiate parts of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and by his use of tariffs to force China to repeat some promises of reform and promise to buy more U.S. goods. But there are several important differences between Trump\\u2019s previous trade fights and the looming showdown with Europe\\u2014above and beyond the fact that the EU for decades has been a U.S. ally, not a rising strategic competitor like China.\\n\\nFirst, China\\u2019s longtime, egregious abuse of economic levers including state-owned firms, industrial subsidies, theft of intellectual property, and forced technology transfer was never much in doubt and in fact generated bipartisan agreement in Washington on the need to confront Beijing. Even at the height of Trump\\u2019s trade war with China, for example, Democratic presidential candidates vied among themselves to see who could be tougher on China; few turned a blind eye to the country\\u2019s well-documented abuses.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s not the case with Europe, where Trump\\u2019s invocation of a specious national security excuse to slap the EU with tariffs on steel and aluminum in 2018 met with protest among all mainstream economists and from both sides of the political aisle. While it\\u2019s true that some European trade policies have long rankled successive U.S. administrations\\u2014including state support for the aerospace giant Airbus and a doggedly closed agricultural market and some remaining tariff barriers\\u2014Europe, despite the administration\\u2019s reiterated protestations, has never been a worse trade offender than China. (And those trade irritants work both ways: Boeing, too, enjoys state support, and Europeans are uncomfortable with U.S. efforts to force the rest of the world to swallow genetically modified foods and a hands-off approach to regulation.)\\n\\nThose fundamental differences determine the tools that the United States can use in its trade fights with Europe. While the trade war with China was predicated on a so-called Section 301 investigation, which highlighted real and systemic problems in the Chinese economy, Trump\\u2019s war with Europe is predicated on fabricated national security grounds that likely have little standing under international trade law. (U.S. measures are still awaiting their day in trade court.)\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs, and, more importantly, his threat to slap all auto imports with tariffs, are all based on the argument that buying steel pipes or sports cars from NATO allies represents a grave security threat to the United States. Of course, in the case of auto imports, it\\u2019s impossible to know what the Trump administration actually determined in the course of a so-called Section 232 investigation.

That was followed by further threats by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to use the auto tariffs to punish European countries that tax American digital firms, further clouding the prospects for trade peace just days after France tendered an olive branch in the contentious fight over global tax rules.\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s discordant performance in Davos, where he took his \\u201cAmerica First\\u201d economic message to the very epicenter of the internationalist set, highlights the difficulties Europe will face this year in taming Trump\\u2019s unilateralist and protectionist instincts. While Europeans were quietly celebrating what seemed to them the rebirth of a multilateral approach to trade disputes\\u2014a little-noticed agreement this month with the United States and Japan to tackle industrial subsidies\\u2014Trump again railed against an international trade order he thinks is stacked against him and that he is steadily dismantling.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Trump declared that the United States is a \\u201cdeveloping nation,\\u201d in need of the same preferential treatment under World Trade Organization rules as China and India, and called for a massive reform of the quarter-century-old trading organization. And he again took aim at Europe\\u2019s alleged trade abuses, describing the European Union as a worse offender than China.\\n\\nAfter three years of steady, but still limited U.S. trade attacks on Europe\\u2014tariffs on steel and a host of other products, and a long-simmering fight over Europe\\u2019s support for Airbus\\u2014the EU is bracing this year to receive the full brunt of Trump\\u2019s trade anger.\\n\\n\\u201cThe European Union tried to gain some time, and had Washington focused on Beijing, but now we are on the menu ahead of the presidential election,\\u201d said Elvire Fabry, a trade expert at the Institut Jacques Delors in Paris. \\u201cTrump will expect to have some new scalps to show from the European side.\\u201d\\n\\nTrump may be emboldened by his relative success in browbeating Canada and Mexico to renegotiate parts of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and by his use of tariffs to force China to repeat some promises of reform and promise to buy more U.S. goods. But there are several important differences between Trump\\u2019s previous trade fights and the looming showdown with Europe\\u2014above and beyond the fact that the EU for decades has been a U.S. ally, not a rising strategic competitor like China.\\n\\nFirst, China\\u2019s longtime, egregious abuse of economic levers including state-owned firms, industrial subsidies, theft of intellectual property, and forced technology transfer was never much in doubt and in fact generated bipartisan agreement in Washington on the need to confront Beijing. Even at the height of Trump\\u2019s trade war with China, for example, Democratic presidential candidates vied among themselves to see who could be tougher on China; few turned a blind eye to the country\\u2019s well-documented abuses.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s not the case with Europe, where Trump\\u2019s invocation of a specious national security excuse to slap the EU with tariffs on steel and aluminum in 2018 met with protest among all mainstream economists and from both sides of the political aisle. While it\\u2019s true that some European trade policies have long rankled successive U.S. administrations\\u2014including state support for the aerospace giant Airbus and a doggedly closed agricultural market and some remaining tariff barriers\\u2014Europe, despite the administration\\u2019s reiterated protestations, has never been a worse trade offender than China. (And those trade irritants work both ways: Boeing, too, enjoys state support, and Europeans are uncomfortable with U.S. efforts to force the rest of the world to swallow genetically modified foods and a hands-off approach to regulation.)\\n\\nThose fundamental differences determine the tools that the United States can use in its trade fights with Europe. While the trade war with China was predicated on a so-called Section 301 investigation, which highlighted real and systemic problems in the Chinese economy, Trump\\u2019s war with Europe is predicated on fabricated national security grounds that likely have little standing under international trade law. (U.S. measures are still awaiting their day in trade court.)\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs, and, more importantly, his threat to slap all auto imports with tariffs, are all based on the argument that buying steel pipes or sports cars from NATO allies represents a grave security threat to the United States. Of course, in the case of auto imports, it\\u2019s impossible to know what the Trump administration actually determined in the course of a so-called Section 232 investigation. The Commerce Department has refused to share the findings with Congress or the public, even though it is mandated to do so by law; the Justice Department, meanwhile, is so scared the findings could be made public it has kept them classified.

But there are several important differences between Trump\\u2019s previous trade fights and the looming showdown with Europe\\u2014above and beyond the fact that the EU for decades has been a U.S. ally, not a rising strategic competitor like China.\\n\\nFirst, China\\u2019s longtime, egregious abuse of economic levers including state-owned firms, industrial subsidies, theft of intellectual property, and forced technology transfer was never much in doubt and in fact generated bipartisan agreement in Washington on the need to confront Beijing. Even at the height of Trump\\u2019s trade war with China, for example, Democratic presidential candidates vied among themselves to see who could be tougher on China; few turned a blind eye to the country\\u2019s well-documented abuses.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s not the case with Europe, where Trump\\u2019s invocation of a specious national security excuse to slap the EU with tariffs on steel and aluminum in 2018 met with protest among all mainstream economists and from both sides of the political aisle. While it\\u2019s true that some European trade policies have long rankled successive U.S. administrations\\u2014including state support for the aerospace giant Airbus and a doggedly closed agricultural market and some remaining tariff barriers\\u2014Europe, despite the administration\\u2019s reiterated protestations, has never been a worse trade offender than China. (And those trade irritants work both ways: Boeing, too, enjoys state support, and Europeans are uncomfortable with U.S. efforts to force the rest of the world to swallow genetically modified foods and a hands-off approach to regulation.)\\n\\nThose fundamental differences determine the tools that the United States can use in its trade fights with Europe. While the trade war with China was predicated on a so-called Section 301 investigation, which highlighted real and systemic problems in the Chinese economy, Trump\\u2019s war with Europe is predicated on fabricated national security grounds that likely have little standing under international trade law. (U.S. measures are still awaiting their day in trade court.)\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs, and, more importantly, his threat to slap all auto imports with tariffs, are all based on the argument that buying steel pipes or sports cars from NATO allies represents a grave security threat to the United States. Of course, in the case of auto imports, it\\u2019s impossible to know what the Trump administration actually determined in the course of a so-called Section 232 investigation. The Commerce Department has refused to share the findings with Congress or the public, even though it is mandated to do so by law; the Justice Department, meanwhile, is so scared the findings could be made public it has kept them classified. Additionally, the lack of U.S. action on auto tariffs in the months after the conclusion of the investigation means the window has closed and that the measures cannot now be implemented, at least legally.\\n\\nOne potential problem for the Trump administration\\u2019s showdown with Europe is that while tariffs seemed to work to get China to make some concessions, it was a viable approach because the duties did only moderate harm to most sectors of the U.S. economy, mainly small businesses (and farmers caught in the crossfire), while consumers emerged largely unscathed. Putting 25 percent tariffs on imports of European autos and auto parts, on the other hand, would cause immense and immediate pain for U.S. manufacturers and consumers, destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs and raising the cost of new cars by thousands of dollars.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s why many in Europe figure Trump has just one real arrow in his quiver, and it\\u2019s unlikely he\\u2019ll use it, as it would hurt the United States as much or more than Europe.\\n\\n\\u201cTrump\\u2019s main weapon are the auto tariffs,\\u201d Fabry said. But the auto tariffs would have such an immediate spillover effect on important sectors like autoworkers that, seen from Europe, they aren\\u2019t as credible a threat as Trump\\u2019s tariffs on China. \\u201cThe impact would be so huge on everybody, I don\\u2019t think that Trump can manage that cost ahead of the election.\\u201d\\n\\nThat\\u2019s why, despite the theatrics this week in Davos and the ever-present threat of new Trump tariffs, there is some optimism in Europe about reaching a trade accommodation with the United States. The new EU trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, struck a conciliatory tone in his visit to Washington last week. On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to pause the new French digital tax while both sides look for a solution\\u2014avoiding another round of painful U.S. tariffs. And von der Leyen on Wednesday again suggested that the framework for a limited trade agreement, focused on industrial tariffs and energy trade, could be wrapped up in a matter of weeks.\\n\\n\\u201cIf we want to move on industrial tariffs, we can go quickly\\u2014that was the most advanced chapter\\u201d of the now-moribund Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, an Obama administration-era free-trade deal with the European Union, Fabry said. Coupled with some rhetorical concessions from Hogan on agricultural regulation, \\u201cthe signal from Brussels is that it is ready for negotiations,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nThat doesn\\u2019t mean an end to trade tensions with the United States.

These adjustments are not tied to specific accounting transactions, but they are often included in account summaries to cover for balances between systems that cannot be reconciled.\\n\\nAs The Free Thought Project has reported, not only is it likely that the actual amount of money the DoD and HUD cannot account for is much higher than $21 trillion, due to the fact that researchers did not have access to complete data, but the practice of creating counterfeit adjustments appears to be standard procedure.\\n\\nPerhaps even more troubling than the total amount lost is the fact that fraudulent behavior from HUD and DOD seem to be the standard operating procedure.

the us government says its on high alert for cyberattacks from foreign countries in this election year","{\"id\": \"npr--2020-01-23--Tech Companies Take A Leading Role In Warning Of Foreign Cyber Threats\", \"date\": \"2020-01-23\", \"source\": \"npr\", \"title\": \"Tech Companies Take A Leading Role In Warning Of Foreign Cyber Threats\", \"content\": \"Tech Companies Take A Leading Role In Warning Of Foreign Cyber Threats\\n\\nThe U.S. government says it's on high alert for cyberattacks from foreign countries in this election year. Yet private cybersecurity firms have often been the ones sounding the alarm, and in some cases, they are selling their services to the U.S. intelligence community.\\n\\n\\\"We've seen Iran impersonating political candidates,\\\" said Sandra Joyce, the head of global intelligence at FireEye, a leading cybersecurity company.\\n\\n\\\"They've even fabricated letters that look like they're coming from concerned citizens. They get themselves published in newspapers. Well-known newspapers. But they're influence operators from Iran. They're not concerned citizens from Texas,\\\" she added.\\n\\nWhether it's Iran, Russia or other foreign actors, cybersecurity companies and research groups have been often been more public than the government in identifying potential foreign threats.\\n\\n\\\"The government doesn't have a monopoly on tracking, identifying or exposing some of these vulnerabilities,\\\" said Graham Brookie, who runs the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council in Washington. \\\"The threat is evolving and threats are becoming more diffuse, more complex and in some ways more open.\\\"\\n\\nThe U.S. government says it welcomes help from tech companies, according to Shelby Pierson, who works for the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire. She was appointed last year to a newly created position that puts her in charge of coordinating election security across the intelligence community.\\n\\n\\\"There is a whole consortium of players in this landscape which include private security firms,\\\" Pierson told NPR in an interview. \\\"Those organizations will actually have deeper and technical insight into those networks before the intelligence community will.\\n\\n\\\"Pierson said the government sometimes buys services from cybersecurity companies, and she cited a couple of the biggest players in the industry.\\n\\n\\\"FireEye and CrowdStrike, for example, have done really good work, where based on the analysis, expertise and information analysis that they do, those are products and services that they can sell to the U.S. government.\\\"\\n\\nThe cyber firm Area 1 Security said it recently detected Russian military intelligence breaking into the computer systems of Burisa. That's the Ukranian gas company where Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, used to be on the board.\\n\\nThis raised suspicions that the Russians are looking for dirt on the Bidens.\\n\\nArea 1 has received a lot of media attention for this report \\u2014 which is good for a private company. However, the tight-lipped U.S. intelligence community hasn't offered its own assessment.\\n\\nSo what's the government's position on the report \\u2014 does it agree, disagree, or just prefer to remain silent?\\n\\n\\\"Of course, these topics are news and newsworthy,\\\" said Brookie, of the Atlantic Council. But he warned that we're going to see a wide range of opinions on how much public attention a potential threat should receive.\\n\\nTech companies have incentives to publicize threats they've uncovered. The media is looking for scoops. Yet the government might be inclined to say little or nothing.\\n\\n\\\"And we, collectively between government and media and tech have not shown that we know what to do with that,\\\" Brookie said.\\n\\nThe government is wrestling with the issue, said Pierson.\\n\\n\\\"Some of my [government] colleagues have said, 'Maybe we shouldn't necessarily spook the herd and share all this information,'\\\" she said. \\\"Maybe people go, 'You know what, this is all rigged. That's so much disinformation. I'm not going to vote.' That would be worst case scenario. And frankly, doing the work of our adversaries for them.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, a number of government agencies have pledged to be more open than in the past. The FBI, for example, recently expanded its policy for issuing notifications when it detects a cyberattack.\\n\\nPrivate cybersecurity firms say they often hire people who have worked in the intelligence community.

That's the Ukranian gas company where Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, used to be on the board.\\n\\nThis raised suspicions that the Russians are looking for dirt on the Bidens.\\n\\nArea 1 has received a lot of media attention for this report \\u2014 which is good for a private company. However, the tight-lipped U.S. intelligence community hasn't offered its own assessment.\\n\\nSo what's the government's position on the report \\u2014 does it agree, disagree, or just prefer to remain silent?\\n\\n\\\"Of course, these topics are news and newsworthy,\\\" said Brookie, of the Atlantic Council. But he warned that we're going to see a wide range of opinions on how much public attention a potential threat should receive.\\n\\nTech companies have incentives to publicize threats they've uncovered. The media is looking for scoops. Yet the government might be inclined to say little or nothing.\\n\\n\\\"And we, collectively between government and media and tech have not shown that we know what to do with that,\\\" Brookie said.\\n\\nThe government is wrestling with the issue, said Pierson.\\n\\n\\\"Some of my [government] colleagues have said, 'Maybe we shouldn't necessarily spook the herd and share all this information,'\\\" she said. \\\"Maybe people go, 'You know what, this is all rigged. That's so much disinformation. I'm not going to vote.' That would be worst case scenario. And frankly, doing the work of our adversaries for them.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, a number of government agencies have pledged to be more open than in the past. The FBI, for example, recently expanded its policy for issuing notifications when it detects a cyberattack.\\n\\nPrivate cybersecurity firms say they often hire people who have worked in the intelligence community. And the companies stress that they cultivate close relationships with the government.\\n\\n\\\"We definitely work in lockstep with law enforcement and the intelligence community,\\\" said Karim Hijazi, the head of Prevailion, a cybersecurity company in Houston. \\\"We want to make sure that we're not misstepping.\\\"\\n\\nHis firm put out a report earlier this month saying Iran is probing the computer systems at oil and gas companies. \\n\\n \\n\\nAs all this plays out, many Americans say they're concerned about election security. A poll by NPR, the PBS NewsHour and Marist found 41 percent of those surveyed believe the U.S. is not well prepared, or not prepared at all, to protect the November ballot from interference. \\n\\n \\n\\nGreg Myre is an NPR national security correspondent.

The path that it has taken to get there mirrors the development of SIG brand itself, from an industrial concern that made guns for the Swiss Army to an almost fully American brand.\\n\\nThe P210 first came about as part of a wave of post-WWII small arms modernization across the Swiss Army. The Swiss wanted to replace their variant of the Luger as it was becoming too expensive to manufacture. Swiss industry already attempted to simplify the Luger, but the nineteenth-century design of the pistol meant that only so much could be done.\\n\\nAs a result, SIG, which means Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft, or literally Swiss Industrial Company, produced a variety of small arms to meet the needs of the military. Initially, a variant of the French M1935 pistol was bought, but the design was adapted to fit Swiss needs better and the pistol was redesigned for accuracy. Still, the recoil spring and locking mechanism were largely taken from the M1935 in the P210 design.\\n\\nThe design was finalized in 1949 and was rapidly adopted by the Swiss and Danish militaries. By all accounts, it had a relatively successful service, proving reliable and very accurate. P210s were also popular on the civilian market, where they were used to compete in target shooting competitions.\\n\\nHowever, the intricately machined P210 was rather expensive to produce. In the 1970s, the Swiss SIG entered a partnership with J. P. Sauer and Sohn, a German firearms manufacturer. At the time, Sauer hadn\\u2019t designed a pistol in over twenty years, with their last pistol being the WWII era Sauer 38H police pistol. The partnership was to share expertise and to allow SIG to more easily export firearms.\\n\\nThe new SIG Sauer GmbH, based in Germany, was a branch of the Swiss SIG. Unlike the larger SIG which produced a wide variety of products, SIG Sauer GmbH would only make firearms. Their first product was the P220, a single stack 9mm pistol meant to replace the P210. Designed for production on modern manufacturing equipment, the P220 was far cheaper but not as accurate as the P210.\\n\\nThe P220 would evolve into SIG Sauer\\u2019s most successful line of pistols, spawning the double stack 9mm P226 and it\\u2019s myriad of compact and differently chambered variants. It replaced the P210 in Swiss service; production of the P210 for military use by SIG ended in the 1970s, and it became a civilian gun following that.\\n\\nSIG Sauer GmbH gained an American distributor in the 1980s in SIGARMS Inc. which was set up as a simple import company to sell SIG Sauer pistols to the U.S. market. Most European firearms manufacturers have an American branch registered as a company in the United States, but SIGARMS went a little further. In 1990, they began manufacturing components for SIG Sauer pistols in the United States, and by 1992, they began producing the P229 in .40 S&W. SIGARMS would become SIG Sauer, Inc. in 2007.\\n\\nHowever, trouble at the Swiss SIG was brewing. While the Swiss concern managed to keep itself relevant by designing and producing the SG550 rifle in 5.56 for the Swiss military throughout the 1970s and 1980s, by the 1990s contracts were drying up. The firearms section of SIG was spun off into SIG Arms H\\u00e4mmerli AG, which then became simply H\\u00e4mmerli AG. The larger SIG concern completely cut ties with the firearms division in 2000.\\n\\nFollowing some involvement with the L\\u00fcke & Ortmeier Gruppe, a firm of German investors, H\\u00e4mmerli AG was restructured into SAN Swiss Arms AG, which continued production of P210s until 2005, when they stopped in favor of simply producing the SG550 series of rifles.\\n\\nSIG Sauer GmbH then bought the license to produce P210s in 2010 and produced a limited run of P210s in 2010, which were sold in the United States by SIG Sauer, Inc. under the name P210 Legend.\\n\\nHowever, the partnership between the SIG Sauer GmbH and SIG Sauer, Inc. would only sour in the following years. In 2015, SIG Sauer, Inc. announced that it would stop importing guns from SIG Sauer GmbH in order to take advantage of less restrictive American export laws and to cut costs.

Swiss industry already attempted to simplify the Luger, but the nineteenth-century design of the pistol meant that only so much could be done.\\n\\nAs a result, SIG, which means Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft, or literally Swiss Industrial Company, produced a variety of small arms to meet the needs of the military. Initially, a variant of the French M1935 pistol was bought, but the design was adapted to fit Swiss needs better and the pistol was redesigned for accuracy. Still, the recoil spring and locking mechanism were largely taken from the M1935 in the P210 design.\\n\\nThe design was finalized in 1949 and was rapidly adopted by the Swiss and Danish militaries. By all accounts, it had a relatively successful service, proving reliable and very accurate. P210s were also popular on the civilian market, where they were used to compete in target shooting competitions.\\n\\nHowever, the intricately machined P210 was rather expensive to produce. In the 1970s, the Swiss SIG entered a partnership with J. P. Sauer and Sohn, a German firearms manufacturer. At the time, Sauer hadn\\u2019t designed a pistol in over twenty years, with their last pistol being the WWII era Sauer 38H police pistol. The partnership was to share expertise and to allow SIG to more easily export firearms.\\n\\nThe new SIG Sauer GmbH, based in Germany, was a branch of the Swiss SIG. Unlike the larger SIG which produced a wide variety of products, SIG Sauer GmbH would only make firearms. Their first product was the P220, a single stack 9mm pistol meant to replace the P210. Designed for production on modern manufacturing equipment, the P220 was far cheaper but not as accurate as the P210.\\n\\nThe P220 would evolve into SIG Sauer\\u2019s most successful line of pistols, spawning the double stack 9mm P226 and it\\u2019s myriad of compact and differently chambered variants. It replaced the P210 in Swiss service; production of the P210 for military use by SIG ended in the 1970s, and it became a civilian gun following that.\\n\\nSIG Sauer GmbH gained an American distributor in the 1980s in SIGARMS Inc. which was set up as a simple import company to sell SIG Sauer pistols to the U.S. market. Most European firearms manufacturers have an American branch registered as a company in the United States, but SIGARMS went a little further. In 1990, they began manufacturing components for SIG Sauer pistols in the United States, and by 1992, they began producing the P229 in .40 S&W. SIGARMS would become SIG Sauer, Inc. in 2007.\\n\\nHowever, trouble at the Swiss SIG was brewing. While the Swiss concern managed to keep itself relevant by designing and producing the SG550 rifle in 5.56 for the Swiss military throughout the 1970s and 1980s, by the 1990s contracts were drying up. The firearms section of SIG was spun off into SIG Arms H\\u00e4mmerli AG, which then became simply H\\u00e4mmerli AG. The larger SIG concern completely cut ties with the firearms division in 2000.\\n\\nFollowing some involvement with the L\\u00fcke & Ortmeier Gruppe, a firm of German investors, H\\u00e4mmerli AG was restructured into SAN Swiss Arms AG, which continued production of P210s until 2005, when they stopped in favor of simply producing the SG550 series of rifles.\\n\\nSIG Sauer GmbH then bought the license to produce P210s in 2010 and produced a limited run of P210s in 2010, which were sold in the United States by SIG Sauer, Inc. under the name P210 Legend.\\n\\nHowever, the partnership between the SIG Sauer GmbH and SIG Sauer, Inc. would only sour in the following years. In 2015, SIG Sauer, Inc. announced that it would stop importing guns from SIG Sauer GmbH in order to take advantage of less restrictive American export laws and to cut costs. This caused major concern at SIG Sauer GmbH, as massive layoffs and a cut of almost half of the workforce resulted.\\n\\nThe latest P210s that were shown off at recent shows have been completely made in the United States, by SIG Sauer Inc. By all accounts, the new release is looking to be extremely popular on the American civilian market. But pistols made by SIG Sauer, Inc. have had a mixed reputation for quality. If the same manufacturing issues that have affected the P365 and U.S.-made P226s crop up, SIG Sauer, Inc. may slightly tarnish the P210\\u2019s reputation for reliability and well-crafted fit and finish.\\n\\nThere the story of the P210 ends, for now.

In 2015, SIG Sauer, Inc. announced that it would stop importing guns from SIG Sauer GmbH in order to take advantage of less restrictive American export laws and to cut costs. This caused major concern at SIG Sauer GmbH, as massive layoffs and a cut of almost half of the workforce resulted.\\n\\nThe latest P210s that were shown off at recent shows have been completely made in the United States, by SIG Sauer Inc. By all accounts, the new release is looking to be extremely popular on the American civilian market. But pistols made by SIG Sauer, Inc. have had a mixed reputation for quality. If the same manufacturing issues that have affected the P365 and U.S.-made P226s crop up, SIG Sauer, Inc. may slightly tarnish the P210\\u2019s reputation for reliability and well-crafted fit and finish.\\n\\nThere the story of the P210 ends, for now. Produced by four different companies: the original SIG, Swiss Arms, SIG Sauer GmbH, and SIG Sauer Inc, the pistol remains one of the most accurate in the world today.\\n\\nEach company has made their own unique variants. Swiss Arms made special long barrel variants for target shooting, SIG Sauer GmbH made some slight alterations to the safety in the P210 Legend, and the latest P210 \\u201cStandard\\u201d from SIG Sauer, Inc. changes the safety position completely to that of a regular thumb safety and reprofiles the trigger guard.\\n\\nHowever, what\\u2019s notable is Swiss Arms AG, SIG Sauer GmbH, SIG Sauer Inc, and even J. P. Sauer and Sohn all fall under the same German holding group, the same L\\u00fcke & Ortmeier Gruppe that bought and restructured H\\u00e4mmerli AG back in the 2000s.\\n\\nCharlie Gao studied political and computer science at Grinnell College and is a frequent commentator on defense and national-security issues.

CrisisFACTS-010-News-39-0,CrisisFACTS-010,if labour doesnt talk to the voters it lost i fear for the future redhills the headquarters of the durham miners association is one of the glories of the british labour movement,"{\"id\": \"theguardianuk--2020-01-23--'If Labour doesn't talk to the voters it lost, I fear for the future'\", \"date\": \"2020-01-23\", \"source\": \"theguardianuk\", \"title\": \"'If Labour doesn't talk to the voters it lost, I fear for the future'\", \"content\": \"Redhills, the headquarters of the Durham Miners\\u2019 Association, is one of the glories of the British labour movement. Opened in 1915, it remains a symbol of self-organisation, pride and collective power, rivalling in splendour the mansions built by the region\\u2019s wealthiest mine owners. On the first floor, a colourful painting from 1947, Years of Victory, celebrates the nationalisation of the coal industry; smiling, suited miners and their wives march through Durham city, in front of a banner featuring former the Labour party leaders Clement Attlee and Keir Hardie.\\n\\nSince December, that kind of happy optimism is in short supply in the corridors of the DMA, traditionally a bastion of \\u201cold Labour\\u201d values. The scale of the unprecedented humiliation of the party at last month\\u2019s election, when swathes of County Durham and northern England turned Conservative for the first time in generations, felt like much more than a bad night at the polls. As seats such as Bishop Auckland, Sedgefield, North West Durham and Blyth Valley have fallen, there is a feeling that Labour\\u2019s identity \\u2013 its sense of itself \\u2013 has been diminished as well as the party\\u2019s parliamentary numbers.\\n\\nIn a bleak conversation with association stalwarts, a now familiar list of causes is cited: lack of clarity on Brexit; an overloaded manifesto, the unpopularity of Jeremy Corbyn on the doorstep and the issue of antisemitism. The role of Momentum, perceived as an anti-democratic movement, is also criticised. But for those whose politics were tempered in the fire and fury of the 1980s miners\\u2019 strike, there is a fear that the true source of this malaise lies much deeper, rooted in long-term industrial decline in which Labour governments are perceived to have been complicit. And there is trepidation that the worst may not be over.\\n\\n\\u201cPeople in the north-east and working-class communities generally feel let down by Labour over generations,\\u201d says Alan Mardghum, the DMA\\u2019s general secretary. \\u201cThere is a perception that they haven\\u2019t done enough, they haven\\u2019t sufficiently been on working people\\u2019s side. We\\u2019ve seen a steady decline in support over years. My fear is now that Labour in the north-east is in the same situation that the Labour party found itself in Scotland, and they\\u2019ve been absolutely decimated there. Wiped out. If they don\\u2019t address the issues and talk to people, and I\\u2019m not talking about the chattering classes in London, I mean the people up here who didn\\u2019t vote for them, I fear for the future. We need to put it right.\\u201d A backer of Jeremy Corbyn, Mardghum is not yet willing to be drawn on who he might favour as Corbyn\\u2019s successor.\\n\\nThe profound disconnect between the party and former heartlands that he identifies is easier to diagnose than to fix. Cultural continuities and political loyalties, which in regions like Durham appeared to survive the collapse of the industries that generated them, appear to be breaking down. The DMA still runs the well-attended summer gala and offers support and advice to ex-mining communities. But the Sedgefield and North West Durham constituencies lost their pits more than two generations ago. \\u201cMargaret Thatcher didn\\u2019t succeed in her ambition to smash the ethos as well as the industry of the coalfield,\\u201d says Stephen Guy, an ex-miner and former Labour councillor. \\u201cBut with the passage of time, the sense of community is beginning to break up and fragment.\\u201d\\n\\nMary Stratford is 64. A labour activist all her life, she volunteers with a miners\\u2019 heritage education group. \\u201cLet\\u2019s face it,\\u201d she says, \\u201cUp here you\\u2019ve got a mainly white working class and you\\u2019ve got an ageing population, as a direct result of the fact that jobs have disappeared and young people are having to leave if they want to find work. That left a vacuum and there have been warning signs [for Labour].

At times, she believes, Labour has shown a tin ear for what local communities value and desire.

Starmer made a theme of the need to win back the trust of the post-industrial regions. But it is Nandy, who, since founding the Centre for Towns in 2017, has most actively tried to navigate the complex politics of post-industrial decline.\\n\\nIf the relationship with regions like County Durham is to be renewed, she says, a relationship of mutual respect has to be re-established. \\u201cStretching back four decades under successive leaders,\\u201d says Nandy, \\u201cthe Labour leadership has disconnected from people in these kind of places; it has more or less given the impression that \\u2018We don\\u2019t understand you and we don\\u2019t particularly like you.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nThe emphasis during that period on investment in cities, as dynamic drivers of economic growth and magnets for the young, has compounded the sense in older, smaller communities that they are now disregarded, having outlived their industrial usefulness, and that Labour has not fought their corner.\\n\\n\\u201cThere has been investment in cities, but not much of that benefit of that has been felt outside.

The future of governance, should not, must not, be about small policy groups producing top-heavy manifestos and delivering them to a grateful nation. People want to have pride in using their own knowledge, assets and skills.\\u201d\\n\\nShe points to the Preston model, where public procurement is leading the way in keeping and circulating money within the local economy. In Liverpool, near the Anfield football stadium, a community land trust run by local residents has begun the re-generation of a derelict area of terrace houses, building on the success of a bakery taken over by locals and run as a co-operative. For Labour, nationally and locally, to renew the ties that bind, Nandy believes it must enable, empower and see the emotional value of this kind of enterprise \\u2013 and trust in the open inclusive ethos it will create.\\n\\nIn County Durham, given the struggles of the last 30 years or so, there is an understandable tendency to look back to happier times. But dewy-eyed nostalgia, acknowledges Mary Stratford, can be a dangerously distorting lens through which to view the world. She wryly recalls the tendency for important union decisions in the 1980s to be taken at 6pm, when any women present had left to collect children from school. \\u201cThe DMA was never just a union,\\u201d she says, it was the central core of any community. But its culture could be very male.\\u201d In terms of gender, ethnicity and the nature of employment, the working class has changed beyond recognition.\\n\\nNevertheless, she shares a belief with Guy that memories of past solidarity and cohesion can inform a better future: \\u201cI wish we could transport you in a Tardis,\\u201d he says, \\u201cand get you back to the east coast and the mining communities of the 70s and 80s; back to Seaham, where I\\u2019m from. We had an olympic-sized swimming pool with a 10m diving board, bowling, a youth club, a library, all funded by the miners. The life of the place was so much better than now.\\u201d\\n\\nStratford chips in: \\u201cIn the 1920s and 30s, the women in this region were doing remarkable things in health and social care. They were forming the basis of the welfare state. That\\u2019s what Labour needs to be at the heart of again now.

To condition yourself for the coming shock, keep in mind that the same Hitler that is said to have hated Jews and systematically gassed and burnt them, had 150,000 half-and quarter-Jews serving in his armies, \\u201cmostly as combat officers, and these included at least 15 half-Jewish generals and admirals, with another dozen quarter Jews holding those same high ranks.\\n\\nThe most notable example was Field Marshal Erhard Milch, Hermann Goering\\u2019s powerful second-in-command, who played such an important operational role in creating the Luftwaffe. Milch certainly had a Jewish father, and according to some much less substantiated claims, perhaps even a Jewish mother as well, while his sister was married to an SS general.\\u201d\\n\\nWhen truth-tellers rattle our cages, we get upset over having our comfortable make-believe world disturbed and shout invectives. Rather than condemn the messanger, the more mature response would be to condemn those who lied to us and institutionalized false history into our consciousness. Keep in mind that the few who tell you the truth pay a high price for doing so; therefore, you should refrain from adding your invective to the copious amount heaped on them by the Establishment.\\n\\nThink about it. Which is your true friend, the one who tells you the truth, or the one who controls the explanations you receive in order to advance his own agenda?\\n\\nI again state my admiration of Ron Unz. He is Jewish. He is highly intelligent. He is a Harvard graduate. He is an entrepreneur who made himself a multi-millionaire. He could have held his fire and risen to the top of the establishment. Instead, he chose to tell us the truth. Ron Unz is the person who should be President. Unlike Trump, Unz would know how to staff a government that would put truth and morality back in charge of our future.\\n\\nHere is Ron Unz weighing for us the historical evidence on who was the worst war criminal. The emphasis is added:\\n\\nFor most present-day Americans, the primary image associated with Hitler and his German regime is the horrendous scale of the war-crimes that they supposedly committed during the global conflict that they are alleged to have unleashed. But in one of his lectures, Irving made the rather telling observation that the relative scale of such World War II crimes and especially their evidentiary base might not necessarily point in the direction of implicating the Germans.\\n\\nAlthough Hollywood and those in its thrall have endlessly cited the findings of the Nuremberg Tribunals as the final word on Nazi barbarism, even a cursory examination of those proceedings raises enormous skepticism.\\n\\nAs time passed, historians gradually acknowledged that some of the most shocking and lurid pieces of evidence used to secure worldwide condemnation of the defendants\\u2014the human lampshades and bars of soap, the shrunken heads\\u2014were entirely fraudulent.\\n\\nThe Soviets were determined to prosecute the Nazis for the Katyn Forest massacre of the captured Polish officer corps even though the Western Allies were convinced that Stalin had actually been responsible, a belief eventually confirmed by Gorbachev and the newly-opened Soviet archives. If the Germans had actually done so many horrible things, one wonders why the prosecution would have bothered including such fabricated and false charges.\\n\\nAnd over the decades, considerable evidence has accumulated that the Gas Chambers and the Jewish Holocaust\\u2014the central elements of today\\u2019s Nazi \\u201cBlack Legend\\u201d\\u2014were just as fictional as all those other items.\\n\\nThe Germans were notoriously meticulous record-keepers, embracing orderly bureaucracy like no other people, and nearly all their archives were captured at the end of the war. Under these circumstances, it seems rather odd that there are virtually no traces of the plans or directives associated with the monstrous crimes that their leadership supposedly ordered committed in such massively industrial fashion. Instead, the entirety of the evidence seems to consist of a tiny quantity of rather doubtful documentary material, the dubious interpretations of certain phrases, and various German confessions, often obtained under brutal torture.\\n\\nGiven his crucial wartime role in Military Intelligence, John Beaty [The Iron Curtain Over America] was particularly harsh in his denunciation of the proceedings, and the numerous top American generals who endorsed his book add considerably to the weight of his verdict:\\n\\nBy contrast, Irving notes that if the Allies had instead been in the dock at Nuremberg, the evidence of their guilt would have been absolutely overwhelming. After all, it was Churchill who began the illegal terror-bombing of cities, a strategy deliberately intended to provoke German retaliation and which eventually led to the death of a million or more European civilians.\\n\\nLate in the war, military reversals had even persuaded the British leader to order similarly illegal poison gas attacks against German cities, along with the initiation of even more horrific biological warfare involving anthrax bombs. Irving located these signed directives in the British archives, although Churchill was later persuaded to countermand them before they were carried out. By contrast, German archival material demonstrates that Hitler had repeatedly ruled out any first use of such illegal weapons under any circumstances, even though Germany\\u2019s far deadlier arsenal might have turned the tide of the war in its favor.\\n\\nAlthough long forgotten today, Freda Utley was a mid-century journalist of some prominence. Born an Englishwoman, she had married a Jewish Communist and moved to Soviet Russia, then fled to America after her husband fell in one of Stalin\\u2019s purges.\\n\\nAlthough hardly sympathetic to the defeated Nazis, she strongly shared Beaty\\u2019s view of the monstrous perversion of justice at Nuremberg and her first-hand account of the months spent in Occupied Germany is eye-opening in its description of the horrific suffering imposed upon the prostrate population even years after the end of the war. Moreover:\\n\\nThe population movement certainly seems to have represented the largest ethnic-cleansing in the history of the world, and if the Germany had ever done anything even remotely similar during its years of European victories and conquests, the visually-gripping scenes of such an enormous flood of desperate, trudging refugees would surely have become a centerpiece of numerous World War II movies of the last seventy years. But since nothing like that ever happened, Hollywood screenwriters lost a tremendous opportunity.\\n\\nI think perhaps the most plausible explanation for the widespread promotion of a multitude of largely fictional German war-crimes at Nuremberg was to the camouflage and obscure the very real ones actually committed by the Allies.\\n\\nOther related indicators may be found in the extreme tone of some of the American publications of the period, even those produced well before our country even entered the war. For example:\\n\\nSurely any such similar book published in Hitler\\u2019s Germany that advocated the extermination of all Jews or Slavs would have been a centerpiece at Nuremberg, and any newspaper reviewers who had treated it favorably would probably have stood in the dock for \\u201ccrimes against humanity.\\u201d\\n\\nMeanwhile, the terrible nature of the Pacific War fought in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor is suggested by a 1944 issue of Life magazine that carried the photo of a young American woman with the skull of a Japanese soldier her boyfriend had sent her as a war souvenir. If any Nazi magazines ever featured similar images, I doubt the Allies would have had any need to fabricate ridiculous stories of human lampshades or soap.\\n\\nAnd remarkably enough, that grotesque scene actually provides a reasonably accurate indication of the savage atrocities that were regularly committed during the brutal fighting of the Pacific Theater. These unpleasant facts were fully set forth in War Without Mercy, an award-winning 1986 volume by eminent American historian John W. Dower that received glowing accolades by leading scholars and public intellectuals.\\n\\nThe unfortunate truth is that Americans typically massacred Japanese who sought to surrender or who had even already been taken as prisoners, with the result that only a small slice\\u2014during some years merely a tiny sliver\\u2014of Japanese troops defeated in battle ever survived.\\n\\nThe traditional excuse publicly offered for the virtual absence of any Japanese POWs was that their Bushido code made surrender unthinkable, yet when the Soviets defeated Japanese armies in 1945, they had no difficulty capturing over a million prisoners. Indeed, since interrogating prisoners was important for intelligence purposes, late in the war U.S. commanders began offering rewards such as ice cream to their troops for bringing some surrendering Japanese in alive rather than killing them in the field.\\n\\nAmerican GIs also regularly committed remarkably savage atrocities. Dead or wounded Japanese frequently had their gold teeth knocked out and taken as war-booty, and their ears were often cut-off and kept as souvenirs, as was also sometimes the case with their skulls. Meanwhile, Dower notes the absence of any evidence suggesting similar behavior on the other side.\\n\\nThe American media generally portrayed the Japanese as vermin fit for eradication, and numerous public statements by high-ranking American military leaders explicitly claimed that the bulk of the entire Japanese population would probably need to be exterminated in order to bring the war to a successful conclusion. Comparing such thoroughly-documented facts with the rather tenuous accusations usually leveled against Nazi political or military leaders is quite revealing.\\n\\nDuring the late 1980s evidence of other deep wartime secrets suddenly came to light.\\n\\nWhile visiting France during 1986 in preparation for an unrelated book, a Canadian writer named James Bacque stumbled upon clues suggesting that one of the most terrible secrets of post-war Germany had long remained completely hidden, and he soon embarked upon extensive research into the subject, finally publishing Other Losses in 1989. Based upon very considerable evidence, including government records, personal interviews, and recorded eyewitness testimony, he argued that after the end of the war, the Americans had starved to death as many as a million German POWs, seemingly as a deliberate act of policy, a war crime that would surely rank among the greatest in history. For decades, Western propagandists had relentlessly barraged the Soviets with claims that they were keeping back a million or more \\u201cmissing\\u201d German POWs as slave-laborers in their Gulag, while the Soviets had endlessly denied these accusations. According to Bacque, the Soviets had been telling the truth all along, and the missing soldiers had been among the enormous numbers who had fled westward near the end of the war, seeking what they assumed would be far better treatment at the hands of the advancing Anglo-American armies. But instead, they were denied all normal legal protections, and confined under horrible conditions where they rapidly perished of hunger, illness, and exposure. Without attempting to summarize Bacque\\u2019s extensive accumulation of supporting material, a few of his factual elements are worth mentioning. At the close of hostilities, the American government employed circuitous legal reasoning to argue that the many millions of German troops that they had captured should not be considered \\u201cprisoners of war\\u201d and therefore were not covered by the provisions of the Geneva Convention. Soon afterward, attempts by the International Red Cross to provide food shipments to the enormous Allied prison camps were repeatedly rejected, and notices were posted throughout the nearby German towns and villages that any civilian who attempted to smuggle food to the desperate POWs might be shot on sight. These undeniable historical facts do seem to suggest certain dark possibilities. Although initially released by an obscure publisher, Bacque\\u2019s book soon became a sensation and an international best-seller. He paints Gen. Dwight Eisenhower as the central culprit behind the tragedy, noting the far lower POW losses in areas outside his control, and suggests that as a highly ambitious \\u201cpolitical general\\u201d of German-American ancestry, he may have been under intense pressure to demonstrate his \\u201charshness\\u201d toward the defeated Wehrmacht foe. Furthermore, once the Cold War ended and the Soviet Archives were open to scholars, their contents seem to have strongly validated Bacque\\u2019s thesis. He notes that although the archives do contain explicit evidence of such long-denied atrocities as Stalin\\u2019s Katyn Forest massacre of Poland\\u2019s officer corps, they show absolutely no signs of any million missing German POWs, who instead had very likely ended their lives in the starvation and illness of Eisenhower\\u2019s death camps. Bacque points out that the German government has issued severe legal threats against anyone seeking to investigate the likely sites of the mass graves that might hold the remains of those long-dead POWs, and in an updated edition, he also mentions Germany\\u2019s enactment of harsh new laws meting out heavy prison sentences to anyone who merely questions the official narrative of World War II. Bacque\\u2019s discussion of the new evidence of the Kremlin archives constitutes a relatively small portion of his 1997 sequel, Crimes and Mercies, which centered around an even more explosive analysis, and also became an international best-seller. As described above, first-hand observers of post-war Germany in 1947 and 1948 such as Gollanz and Utley, had directly reported on the horrific conditions they discovered, and stated that for years official food rations for the entire population had been comparable to that of the inmates of Nazi concentration camps and sometimes far lower, leading to the widespread malnutrition and illness they witnessed all around them. They also noted the destruction of most of Germany\\u2019s pre-war housing stock and the severe overcrowding produced by the influx of so many millions of pitiful ethnic German refugees expelled from other parts of Central and Eastern Europe. But these visitors lacked any access to solid population statistics, and could only speculate upon the enormous human death toll that hunger and illness had already inflicted, and which would surely continue if policies were not quickly changed. Years of archival research by Bacque attempt to answer this question, and the conclusion he provides is certainly not a pleasant one. Both the Allied military government and the later German civilian authorities seem to have made a concerted effort to hide or obscure the true scale of the calamity visited upon German civilians during the years 1945-1950, and the official mortality statistics found in government reports are simply too fantastical to possibly be correct, although they became the basis for the subsequent histories of that period. Bacque notes that these figures suggest that the death rate during the terrible conditions of 1947, long remembered as the \\u201cHunger Year\\u201d (Hungerjahr) and vividly described in Gollancz\\u2019s account, was actually lower than that of the prosperous Germany of the late 1960s. Furthermore, private reports by American officials, mortality rates from individual localities, and other strong evidence demonstrate that these long-accepted aggregate numbers were essentially fictional. Instead, Bacque attempts to provide more realistic estimates based upon an examination of the population totals of the various German censuses together with the recorded influx of the huge number of German refugees. Based upon this simple analysis, he makes a reasonably strong case that the excess German deaths during that period amounted to at least around 10 million, and possibly many millions more. Furthermore, he provides substantial evidence that the starvation was either deliberate or at least enormously worsened by American government resistance to overseas food relief efforts. Perhaps these numbers should not be so totally surprising given that the official Morgenthau Plan had envisioned the elimination of around 20 million Germans, and as Bacque demonstrates, top American leaders quietly agreed to continue that policy in practice even while they renounced it in theory. Assuming these numbers are even remotely correct, the implications are quite remarkable. The toll of the human catastrophe experienced in post-war Germany would certainly rank among the greatest in modern peacetime history, far exceeding the deaths that occurred during the Ukrainian Famine of the early 1930s and possibly even approaching the wholly unintentional losses during Mao\\u2019s Great Leap Forward of 1959-61. Furthermore, the post-war German losses would vastly outrank either of these other unfortunate events in percentage terms and this would remain true even if the Bacque\\u2019s estimates are considerably reduced. Yet I doubt if even a small fraction of one percent of Americans are today aware of this enormous human calamity. Presumably memories are much stronger in Germany itself, but given the growing legal crackdown on discordant views in that unfortunate country, I suspect that anyone who discusses the topic too energetically risks immediate imprisonment. To a considerable extent, this historical ignorance has been heavily fostered by our governments, often using underhanded or even nefarious means. Just like in the old decaying USSR, much of the current political legitimacy of today\\u2019s American government and its various European vassal-states is founded upon a particular narrative history of World War II, and challenging that narrative might produce dire political consequences. Bacque credibly relates some of the apparent efforts to dissuade any major newspaper or magazine from running articles discussing the startling findings of his first book, thereby imposing a \\u201cblackout\\u201d aimed at absolutely minimizing any media coverage. Such measures seem to have been quite effective, since until eight or nine years ago, I\\u2019m not sure I had ever heard a word of these shocking ideas, and I have certainly never seen them seriously discussed in any of the numerous newspapers or magazines that I have carefully read over the last three decades. Even illegal means were employed to hinder the efforts of this solitary, determined scholar. At times, Bacque\\u2019s phone-lines were tapped, his mail intercepted, and his research materials surreptitiously copied, while his access to some official archives was blocked. Some of the elderly eyewitnesses who personally corroborated his analysis received threatening notes and had their property vandalized. In his Foreword to this 1997 book, De Zayas, the eminent international human rights attorney, praised Bacque\\u2019s ground-breaking research, and hoped that it would soon lead to a major scholarly debate aimed at reassessing the true facts of these historical events that had taken place a half-century earlier. But in his update to the 2007 edition, he expressed some outrage that no such discussion ever occurred, and instead the German government merely passed a series of harsh laws mandating prison sentences for anyone who substantially disputed the settled narrative of World War II and its immediate aftermath, perhaps by overly focusing on the suffering of German civilians. Although both of Bacque\\u2019s books became international best-sellers, the near-complete absence of any secondary media coverage ensured that they never entered public awareness with anything more than a pinprick. Another important factor is the tremendously disproportionate reach of print and electronic media. A best-seller may be read by many tens of thousands of people, but a successful film might reach tens of millions, and so long as Hollywood churns out endless movies denouncing Germany\\u2019s atrocities but not a single one on the other side, the true facts of that history are hardly likely to gain much traction. I strongly suspect that far more people today believe in the real-life existence of Batman and Spiderman than are even aware of the Bacque Hypothesis.\\n\\nMany of the elements presented above were drawn from my previous articles published over the last year or so, but I believe there is some value in providing this same material in unified form rather than only separately, even if the total length necessarily becomes quite considerable.\\n\\nWorld War II dominates our twentieth century landscape like a colossus, and still casts huge shadows across our modern world. That global conflict has probably been the subject of far more sustained coverage, whether in print or electronic media, than any other event in human history. So if we encounter a small handful of highly anomalous items that seem to directly contradict such an ocean of enormously detailed and long-accepted information, there is a natural tendency to dismiss these few outliers as implausible or even delusional.\\n\\nBut once the total number of such discordant seemingly yet well-documented elements becomes sufficiently large, we must take them more seriously, and perhaps eventually concede that most of them are probably correct. As was suggested in a quote widely if doubtfully attributed to Stalin, \\u201cQuantity has a quality all of its own.\\u201d\\n\\nI am hardly the first individual to gradually become aware of this sweeping and cohesive counter-narrative of the Second World War, and a few months ago I happened to read Germany\\u2019s War, published in 2014 by amateur historian John Wear.\\n\\nDrawing from sources that substantially overlap with the ones I have discussed, his conclusions are reasonably similar to my own, but presented in a book length form that includes some 1,200 exact source references. So those interested in a much more detailed exposition of these same issues can read it and decide for themselves.\\n\\nWhen intellectual freedom is under attack, challenging an officially enshrined mythology may become legally perilous. I have seen claims that thousands of individuals who hold heterodox opinions about various aspects of the history of World War II are today imprisoned across Europe on the basis of those beliefs. If so, that total is probably far higher than the number of ideological dissidents who had suffered a similar fate in the decaying Soviet Bloc countries of the 1980s.\\n\\nWorld War II ended nearly three generations ago, and few of its adult survivors still walk the earth. From one perspective the true facts of that conflict and whether or not they actually contradict our traditional beliefs might appear rather irrelevant. Tearing down the statues of some long-dead historical figures and replacing them with the statues of others hardly seems of much practical value.\\n\\nBut if we gradually conclude that the story that all of us have been told during our entire lifetimes is substantially false and perhaps largely inverted, the implications for our understanding of the world are enormous. Most of the surprising material presented here is hardly hidden or kept under lock-and-key. Nearly all the books are easily available at Amazon or even freely readable on the Internet, many of the authors have received critical and scholarly acclaim, and in some cases their works have sold in the millions.\\n\\nYet this important material has been almost entirely ignored or dismissed by the popular media that shapes the common beliefs of our society. So we must necessarily begin to wonder what other massive falsehoods may have been similarly promoted by that media, perhaps involving incidents of the recent past or even the present day. And those latter events do have enormous practical significance. As I pointed out several years ago in my original American Pravda article:\\n\\nEven if the overwhelming majority of the unorthodox claims provided by such non-traditional web-based sources is incorrect, at least there now exists the possibility of extracting vital nuggets of truth from vast mountains of falsehood.\\n\\nWe must also recognize that many of the fundamental ideas that dominate our present-day world were founded upon a particular understanding of that wartime history, and if there seems good reason to believe that narrative is substantially false, perhaps we should begin questioning the framework of beliefs erected upon it.\\n\\nGeorge Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil War during the 1930s and discovered that the true facts in Spain were radically different from what he had been led to believe by the British media of his day. In 1948 these past experiences together with the rapidly congealing \\u201cofficial history\\u201d of the Second World War may have been uppermost in his mind when he published his classic novel 1984, which famously declared that \\u201cWho controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past.\\u201d\\n\\nIndeed, as I noted last year this observation has never been more true than when we consider some of the historical assumptions that govern the politics of today\\u2019s world, and the likelihood that they are entirely misleading:\\n\\nBack in those late Cold War days, the death toll of innocent civilians from the Bolshevik Revolution and the first two decades of the Soviet Regime was generally reckoned at running well into the tens of millions when we include the casualties of the Russian Civil War, the government-induced famines, the Gulag, and the executions. I\\u2019ve heard that these numbers have been substantially revised downwards to perhaps as little as twenty million or so, but no matter. Although determined Soviet apologists may dispute such very large figures, they have always been part of the standard narrative history taught within the West. Meanwhile, all historians know perfectly well that the Bolshevik leaders were overwhelmingly Jewish, with three of the five revolutionaries Lenin named as his plausible successors coming from that background. Although only around 4% of Russia\\u2019s population was Jewish, a few years ago Vladimir Putin stated that Jews constituted perhaps 80-85% of the early Soviet government, an estimate fully consistent with the contemporaneous claims of Winston Churchill, Times of London correspondent Robert Wilton, and the officers of American Military Intelligence. Recent books by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Yuri Slezkine, and others have all painted a very similar picture. And prior to World War II, Jews remained enormously over-represented in the Communist leadership, especially dominating the Gulag administration and the top ranks of the dreaded NKVD. Both of these simple facts have been widely accepted in America throughout my entire lifetime. But combine them together with the relatively tiny size of worldwide Jewry, around 16 million prior to World War II, and the inescapable conclusion is that in per capita terms Jews were the greatest mass-murderers of the twentieth century, holding that unfortunate distinction by an enormous margin and with no other nationality coming even remotely close. And yet, by the astonishing alchemy of Hollywood, the greatest killers of the last one hundred years have somehow been transmuted into being seen as the greatest victims, a transformation so seemingly implausible that future generations will surely be left gasping in awe. Today\\u2019s American Neocons are just as heavily Jewish as were the Bolsheviks of a hundred years ago, and they have greatly benefited from the political immunity provided by this totally bizarre inversion of historical reality. Partly as a consequence of their media-fabricated victimhood status, they have managed to seize control over much of our political system, especially our foreign policy, and have spent the last few years doing their utmost to foment an absolutely insane war with nuclear-armed Russia. If they do manage to achieve that unfortunate goal, they will surely outdo the very impressive human body-count racked up by their ethnic ancestors, perhaps even by an order-of-magnitude or more.\\n\\u2022 American Pravda: Our Great Purge of the 1940s http://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-our-great-purge-of-the-1940s/\", \"author\": \"Edward Morgan\", \"url\": \"https://prepareforchange.net/2020/01/23/the-ww2-war-crimes-of-churchill-and-the-americans-were-far-worse-than-hitlers/\", \"published\": \"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 19:05:04 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1579824304, \"collection_utc\": 1579824181}",News,1579824304

Born an Englishwoman, she had married a Jewish Communist and moved to Soviet Russia, then fled to America after her husband fell in one of Stalin\\u2019s purges.\\n\\nAlthough hardly sympathetic to the defeated Nazis, she strongly shared Beaty\\u2019s view of the monstrous perversion of justice at Nuremberg and her first-hand account of the months spent in Occupied Germany is eye-opening in its description of the horrific suffering imposed upon the prostrate population even years after the end of the war. Moreover:\\n\\nThe population movement certainly seems to have represented the largest ethnic-cleansing in the history of the world, and if the Germany had ever done anything even remotely similar during its years of European victories and conquests, the visually-gripping scenes of such an enormous flood of desperate, trudging refugees would surely have become a centerpiece of numerous World War II movies of the last seventy years. But since nothing like that ever happened, Hollywood screenwriters lost a tremendous opportunity.\\n\\nI think perhaps the most plausible explanation for the widespread promotion of a multitude of largely fictional German war-crimes at Nuremberg was to the camouflage and obscure the very real ones actually committed by the Allies.\\n\\nOther related indicators may be found in the extreme tone of some of the American publications of the period, even those produced well before our country even entered the war. For example:\\n\\nSurely any such similar book published in Hitler\\u2019s Germany that advocated the extermination of all Jews or Slavs would have been a centerpiece at Nuremberg, and any newspaper reviewers who had treated it favorably would probably have stood in the dock for \\u201ccrimes against humanity.\\u201d\\n\\nMeanwhile, the terrible nature of the Pacific War fought in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor is suggested by a 1944 issue of Life magazine that carried the photo of a young American woman with the skull of a Japanese soldier her boyfriend had sent her as a war souvenir. If any Nazi magazines ever featured similar images, I doubt the Allies would have had any need to fabricate ridiculous stories of human lampshades or soap.\\n\\nAnd remarkably enough, that grotesque scene actually provides a reasonably accurate indication of the savage atrocities that were regularly committed during the brutal fighting of the Pacific Theater. These unpleasant facts were fully set forth in War Without Mercy, an award-winning 1986 volume by eminent American historian John W. Dower that received glowing accolades by leading scholars and public intellectuals.\\n\\nThe unfortunate truth is that Americans typically massacred Japanese who sought to surrender or who had even already been taken as prisoners, with the result that only a small slice\\u2014during some years merely a tiny sliver\\u2014of Japanese troops defeated in battle ever survived.\\n\\nThe traditional excuse publicly offered for the virtual absence of any Japanese POWs was that their Bushido code made surrender unthinkable, yet when the Soviets defeated Japanese armies in 1945, they had no difficulty capturing over a million prisoners. Indeed, since interrogating prisoners was important for intelligence purposes, late in the war U.S. commanders began offering rewards such as ice cream to their troops for bringing some surrendering Japanese in alive rather than killing them in the field.\\n\\nAmerican GIs also regularly committed remarkably savage atrocities. Dead or wounded Japanese frequently had their gold teeth knocked out and taken as war-booty, and their ears were often cut-off and kept as souvenirs, as was also sometimes the case with their skulls. Meanwhile, Dower notes the absence of any evidence suggesting similar behavior on the other side.\\n\\nThe American media generally portrayed the Japanese as vermin fit for eradication, and numerous public statements by high-ranking American military leaders explicitly claimed that the bulk of the entire Japanese population would probably need to be exterminated in order to bring the war to a successful conclusion. Comparing such thoroughly-documented facts with the rather tenuous accusations usually leveled against Nazi political or military leaders is quite revealing.\\n\\nDuring the late 1980s evidence of other deep wartime secrets suddenly came to light.\\n\\nWhile visiting France during 1986 in preparation for an unrelated book, a Canadian writer named James Bacque stumbled upon clues suggesting that one of the most terrible secrets of post-war Germany had long remained completely hidden, and he soon embarked upon extensive research into the subject, finally publishing Other Losses in 1989. Based upon very considerable evidence, including government records, personal interviews, and recorded eyewitness testimony, he argued that after the end of the war, the Americans had starved to death as many as a million German POWs, seemingly as a deliberate act of policy, a war crime that would surely rank among the greatest in history. For decades, Western propagandists had relentlessly barraged the Soviets with claims that they were keeping back a million or more \\u201cmissing\\u201d German POWs as slave-laborers in their Gulag, while the Soviets had endlessly denied these accusations. According to Bacque, the Soviets had been telling the truth all along, and the missing soldiers had been among the enormous numbers who had fled westward near the end of the war, seeking what they assumed would be far better treatment at the hands of the advancing Anglo-American armies. But instead, they were denied all normal legal protections, and confined under horrible conditions where they rapidly perished of hunger, illness, and exposure. Without attempting to summarize Bacque\\u2019s extensive accumulation of supporting material, a few of his factual elements are worth mentioning. At the close of hostilities, the American government employed circuitous legal reasoning to argue that the many millions of German troops that they had captured should not be considered \\u201cprisoners of war\\u201d and therefore were not covered by the provisions of the Geneva Convention. Soon afterward, attempts by the International Red Cross to provide food shipments to the enormous Allied prison camps were repeatedly rejected, and notices were posted throughout the nearby German towns and villages that any civilian who attempted to smuggle food to the desperate POWs might be shot on sight. These undeniable historical facts do seem to suggest certain dark possibilities. Although initially released by an obscure publisher, Bacque\\u2019s book soon became a sensation and an international best-seller. He paints Gen. Dwight Eisenhower as the central culprit behind the tragedy, noting the far lower POW losses in areas outside his control, and suggests that as a highly ambitious \\u201cpolitical general\\u201d of German-American ancestry, he may have been under intense pressure to demonstrate his \\u201charshness\\u201d toward the defeated Wehrmacht foe. Furthermore, once the Cold War ended and the Soviet Archives were open to scholars, their contents seem to have strongly validated Bacque\\u2019s thesis. He notes that although the archives do contain explicit evidence of such long-denied atrocities as Stalin\\u2019s Katyn Forest massacre of Poland\\u2019s officer corps, they show absolutely no signs of any million missing German POWs, who instead had very likely ended their lives in the starvation and illness of Eisenhower\\u2019s death camps. Bacque points out that the German government has issued severe legal threats against anyone seeking to investigate the likely sites of the mass graves that might hold the remains of those long-dead POWs, and in an updated edition, he also mentions Germany\\u2019s enactment of harsh new laws meting out heavy prison sentences to anyone who merely questions the official narrative of World War II. Bacque\\u2019s discussion of the new evidence of the Kremlin archives constitutes a relatively small portion of his 1997 sequel, Crimes and Mercies, which centered around an even more explosive analysis, and also became an international best-seller. As described above, first-hand observers of post-war Germany in 1947 and 1948 such as Gollanz and Utley, had directly reported on the horrific conditions they discovered, and stated that for years official food rations for the entire population had been comparable to that of the inmates of Nazi concentration camps and sometimes far lower, leading to the widespread malnutrition and illness they witnessed all around them. They also noted the destruction of most of Germany\\u2019s pre-war housing stock and the severe overcrowding produced by the influx of so many millions of pitiful ethnic German refugees expelled from other parts of Central and Eastern Europe. But these visitors lacked any access to solid population statistics, and could only speculate upon the enormous human death toll that hunger and illness had already inflicted, and which would surely continue if policies were not quickly changed. Years of archival research by Bacque attempt to answer this question, and the conclusion he provides is certainly not a pleasant one. Both the Allied military government and the later German civilian authorities seem to have made a concerted effort to hide or obscure the true scale of the calamity visited upon German civilians during the years 1945-1950, and the official mortality statistics found in government reports are simply too fantastical to possibly be correct, although they became the basis for the subsequent histories of that period. Bacque notes that these figures suggest that the death rate during the terrible conditions of 1947, long remembered as the \\u201cHunger Year\\u201d (Hungerjahr) and vividly described in Gollancz\\u2019s account, was actually lower than that of the prosperous Germany of the late 1960s. Furthermore, private reports by American officials, mortality rates from individual localities, and other strong evidence demonstrate that these long-accepted aggregate numbers were essentially fictional. Instead, Bacque attempts to provide more realistic estimates based upon an examination of the population totals of the various German censuses together with the recorded influx of the huge number of German refugees. Based upon this simple analysis, he makes a reasonably strong case that the excess German deaths during that period amounted to at least around 10 million, and possibly many millions more. Furthermore, he provides substantial evidence that the starvation was either deliberate or at least enormously worsened by American government resistance to overseas food relief efforts. Perhaps these numbers should not be so totally surprising given that the official Morgenthau Plan had envisioned the elimination of around 20 million Germans, and as Bacque demonstrates, top American leaders quietly agreed to continue that policy in practice even while they renounced it in theory. Assuming these numbers are even remotely correct, the implications are quite remarkable. The toll of the human catastrophe experienced in post-war Germany would certainly rank among the greatest in modern peacetime history, far exceeding the deaths that occurred during the Ukrainian Famine of the early 1930s and possibly even approaching the wholly unintentional losses during Mao\\u2019s Great Leap Forward of 1959-61. Furthermore, the post-war German losses would vastly outrank either of these other unfortunate events in percentage terms and this would remain true even if the Bacque\\u2019s estimates are considerably reduced. Yet I doubt if even a small fraction of one percent of Americans are today aware of this enormous human calamity. Presumably memories are much stronger in Germany itself, but given the growing legal crackdown on discordant views in that unfortunate country, I suspect that anyone who discusses the topic too energetically risks immediate imprisonment. To a considerable extent, this historical ignorance has been heavily fostered by our governments, often using underhanded or even nefarious means. Just like in the old decaying USSR, much of the current political legitimacy of today\\u2019s American government and its various European vassal-states is founded upon a particular narrative history of World War II, and challenging that narrative might produce dire political consequences. Bacque credibly relates some of the apparent efforts to dissuade any major newspaper or magazine from running articles discussing the startling findings of his first book, thereby imposing a \\u201cblackout\\u201d aimed at absolutely minimizing any media coverage. Such measures seem to have been quite effective, since until eight or nine years ago, I\\u2019m not sure I had ever heard a word of these shocking ideas, and I have certainly never seen them seriously discussed in any of the numerous newspapers or magazines that I have carefully read over the last three decades. Even illegal means were employed to hinder the efforts of this solitary, determined scholar. At times, Bacque\\u2019s phone-lines were tapped, his mail intercepted, and his research materials surreptitiously copied, while his access to some official archives was blocked. Some of the elderly eyewitnesses who personally corroborated his analysis received threatening notes and had their property vandalized. In his Foreword to this 1997 book, De Zayas, the eminent international human rights attorney, praised Bacque\\u2019s ground-breaking research, and hoped that it would soon lead to a major scholarly debate aimed at reassessing the true facts of these historical events that had taken place a half-century earlier. But in his update to the 2007 edition, he expressed some outrage that no such discussion ever occurred, and instead the German government merely passed a series of harsh laws mandating prison sentences for anyone who substantially disputed the settled narrative of World War II and its immediate aftermath, perhaps by overly focusing on the suffering of German civilians. Although both of Bacque\\u2019s books became international best-sellers, the near-complete absence of any secondary media coverage ensured that they never entered public awareness with anything more than a pinprick. Another important factor is the tremendously disproportionate reach of print and electronic media. A best-seller may be read by many tens of thousands of people, but a successful film might reach tens of millions, and so long as Hollywood churns out endless movies denouncing Germany\\u2019s atrocities but not a single one on the other side, the true facts of that history are hardly likely to gain much traction. I strongly suspect that far more people today believe in the real-life existence of Batman and Spiderman than are even aware of the Bacque Hypothesis.\\n\\nMany of the elements presented above were drawn from my previous articles published over the last year or so, but I believe there is some value in providing this same material in unified form rather than only separately, even if the total length necessarily becomes quite considerable.\\n\\nWorld War II dominates our twentieth century landscape like a colossus, and still casts huge shadows across our modern world. That global conflict has probably been the subject of far more sustained coverage, whether in print or electronic media, than any other event in human history. So if we encounter a small handful of highly anomalous items that seem to directly contradict such an ocean of enormously detailed and long-accepted information, there is a natural tendency to dismiss these few outliers as implausible or even delusional.\\n\\nBut once the total number of such discordant seemingly yet well-documented elements becomes sufficiently large, we must take them more seriously, and perhaps eventually concede that most of them are probably correct. As was suggested in a quote widely if doubtfully attributed to Stalin, \\u201cQuantity has a quality all of its own.\\u201d\\n\\nI am hardly the first individual to gradually become aware of this sweeping and cohesive counter-narrative of the Second World War, and a few months ago I happened to read Germany\\u2019s War, published in 2014 by amateur historian John Wear.\\n\\nDrawing from sources that substantially overlap with the ones I have discussed, his conclusions are reasonably similar to my own, but presented in a book length form that includes some 1,200 exact source references. So those interested in a much more detailed exposition of these same issues can read it and decide for themselves.\\n\\nWhen intellectual freedom is under attack, challenging an officially enshrined mythology may become legally perilous. I have seen claims that thousands of individuals who hold heterodox opinions about various aspects of the history of World War II are today imprisoned across Europe on the basis of those beliefs. If so, that total is probably far higher than the number of ideological dissidents who had suffered a similar fate in the decaying Soviet Bloc countries of the 1980s.\\n\\nWorld War II ended nearly three generations ago, and few of its adult survivors still walk the earth. From one perspective the true facts of that conflict and whether or not they actually contradict our traditional beliefs might appear rather irrelevant. Tearing down the statues of some long-dead historical figures and replacing them with the statues of others hardly seems of much practical value.\\n\\nBut if we gradually conclude that the story that all of us have been told during our entire lifetimes is substantially false and perhaps largely inverted, the implications for our understanding of the world are enormous. Most of the surprising material presented here is hardly hidden or kept under lock-and-key. Nearly all the books are easily available at Amazon or even freely readable on the Internet, many of the authors have received critical and scholarly acclaim, and in some cases their works have sold in the millions.\\n\\nYet this important material has been almost entirely ignored or dismissed by the popular media that shapes the common beliefs of our society. So we must necessarily begin to wonder what other massive falsehoods may have been similarly promoted by that media, perhaps involving incidents of the recent past or even the present day. And those latter events do have enormous practical significance. As I pointed out several years ago in my original American Pravda article:\\n\\nEven if the overwhelming majority of the unorthodox claims provided by such non-traditional web-based sources is incorrect, at least there now exists the possibility of extracting vital nuggets of truth from vast mountains of falsehood.\\n\\nWe must also recognize that many of the fundamental ideas that dominate our present-day world were founded upon a particular understanding of that wartime history, and if there seems good reason to believe that narrative is substantially false, perhaps we should begin questioning the framework of beliefs erected upon it.\\n\\nGeorge Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil War during the 1930s and discovered that the true facts in Spain were radically different from what he had been led to believe by the British media of his day. In 1948 these past experiences together with the rapidly congealing \\u201cofficial history\\u201d of the Second World War may have been uppermost in his mind when he published his classic novel 1984, which famously declared that \\u201cWho controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past.\\u201d\\n\\nIndeed, as I noted last year this observation has never been more true than when we consider some of the historical assumptions that govern the politics of today\\u2019s world, and the likelihood that they are entirely misleading:\\n\\nBack in those late Cold War days, the death toll of innocent civilians from the Bolshevik Revolution and the first two decades of the Soviet Regime was generally reckoned at running well into the tens of millions when we include the casualties of the Russian Civil War, the government-induced famines, the Gulag, and the executions. I\\u2019ve heard that these numbers have been substantially revised downwards to perhaps as little as twenty million or so, but no matter. Although determined Soviet apologists may dispute such very large figures, they have always been part of the standard narrative history taught within the West. Meanwhile, all historians know perfectly well that the Bolshevik leaders were overwhelmingly Jewish, with three of the five revolutionaries Lenin named as his plausible successors coming from that background. Although only around 4% of Russia\\u2019s population was Jewish, a few years ago Vladimir Putin stated that Jews constituted perhaps 80-85% of the early Soviet government, an estimate fully consistent with the contemporaneous claims of Winston Churchill, Times of London correspondent Robert Wilton, and the officers of American Military Intelligence. Recent books by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Yuri Slezkine, and others have all painted a very similar picture. And prior to World War II, Jews remained enormously over-represented in the Communist leadership, especially dominating the Gulag administration and the top ranks of the dreaded NKVD. Both of these simple facts have been widely accepted in America throughout my entire lifetime. But combine them together with the relatively tiny size of worldwide Jewry, around 16 million prior to World War II, and the inescapable conclusion is that in per capita terms Jews were the greatest mass-murderers of the twentieth century, holding that unfortunate distinction by an enormous margin and with no other nationality coming even remotely close. And yet, by the astonishing alchemy of Hollywood, the greatest killers of the last one hundred years have somehow been transmuted into being seen as the greatest victims, a transformation so seemingly implausible that future generations will surely be left gasping in awe. Today\\u2019s American Neocons are just as heavily Jewish as were the Bolsheviks of a hundred years ago, and they have greatly benefited from the political immunity provided by this totally bizarre inversion of historical reality. Partly as a consequence of their media-fabricated victimhood status, they have managed to seize control over much of our political system, especially our foreign policy, and have spent the last few years doing their utmost to foment an absolutely insane war with nuclear-armed Russia. If they do manage to achieve that unfortunate goal, they will surely outdo the very impressive human body-count racked up by their ethnic ancestors, perhaps even by an order-of-magnitude or more.\\n\\u2022 American Pravda: Our Great Purge of the 1940s http://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-our-great-purge-of-the-1940s/\", \"author\": \"Edward Morgan\", \"url\": \"https://prepareforchange.net/2020/01/23/the-ww2-war-crimes-of-churchill-and-the-americans-were-far-worse-than-hitlers/\", \"published\": \"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 19:05:04 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1579824304, \"collection_utc\": 1579824181}",News,1579824304

Revisionist historians who have actually dug up the buried evidence and examined it have made a case that whatever the Nazi crimes, they were rivaled, if not exceeded, by those of Churchill and the Americans.\\n\\nDresden before and after the fire bombing of this civilian city, devoid of any military value, except for terrorizing civilians\\n\\nUnz, a prolific reader with a knack for tying things together reviews some of the true history in what follows. To condition yourself for the coming shock, keep in mind that the same Hitler that is said to have hated Jews and systematically gassed and burnt them, had 150,000 half-and quarter-Jews serving in his armies, \\u201cmostly as combat officers, and these included at least 15 half-Jewish generals and admirals, with another dozen quarter Jews holding those same high ranks.\\n\\nThe most notable example was Field Marshal Erhard Milch, Hermann Goering\\u2019s powerful second-in-command, who played such an important operational role in creating the Luftwaffe. Milch certainly had a Jewish father, and according to some much less substantiated claims, perhaps even a Jewish mother as well, while his sister was married to an SS general.\\u201d\\n\\nWhen truth-tellers rattle our cages, we get upset over having our comfortable make-believe world disturbed and shout invectives. Rather than condemn the messanger, the more mature response would be to condemn those who lied to us and institutionalized false history into our consciousness. Keep in mind that the few who tell you the truth pay a high price for doing so; therefore, you should refrain from adding your invective to the copious amount heaped on them by the Establishment.\\n\\nThink about it. Which is your true friend, the one who tells you the truth, or the one who controls the explanations you receive in order to advance his own agenda?\\n\\nI again state my admiration of Ron Unz. He is Jewish. He is highly intelligent. He is a Harvard graduate. He is an entrepreneur who made himself a multi-millionaire. He could have held his fire and risen to the top of the establishment. Instead, he chose to tell us the truth. Ron Unz is the person who should be President. Unlike Trump, Unz would know how to staff a government that would put truth and morality back in charge of our future.\\n\\nHere is Ron Unz weighing for us the historical evidence on who was the worst war criminal. The emphasis is added:\\n\\nFor most present-day Americans, the primary image associated with Hitler and his German regime is the horrendous scale of the war-crimes that they supposedly committed during the global conflict that they are alleged to have unleashed. But in one of his lectures, Irving made the rather telling observation that the relative scale of such World War II crimes and especially their evidentiary base might not necessarily point in the direction of implicating the Germans.\\n\\nAlthough Hollywood and those in its thrall have endlessly cited the findings of the Nuremberg Tribunals as the final word on Nazi barbarism, even a cursory examination of those proceedings raises enormous skepticism.\\n\\nAs time passed, historians gradually acknowledged that some of the most shocking and lurid pieces of evidence used to secure worldwide condemnation of the defendants\\u2014the human lampshades and bars of soap, the shrunken heads\\u2014were entirely fraudulent.\\n\\nThe Soviets were determined to prosecute the Nazis for the Katyn Forest massacre of the captured Polish officer corps even though the Western Allies were convinced that Stalin had actually been responsible, a belief eventually confirmed by Gorbachev and the newly-opened Soviet archives. If the Germans had actually done so many horrible things, one wonders why the prosecution would have bothered including such fabricated and false charges.\\n\\nAnd over the decades, considerable evidence has accumulated that the Gas Chambers and the Jewish Holocaust\\u2014the central elements of today\\u2019s Nazi \\u201cBlack Legend\\u201d\\u2014were just as fictional as all those other items.\\n\\nThe Germans were notoriously meticulous record-keepers, embracing orderly bureaucracy like no other people, and nearly all their archives were captured at the end of the war. Under these circumstances, it seems rather odd that there are virtually no traces of the plans or directives associated with the monstrous crimes that their leadership supposedly ordered committed in such massively industrial fashion. Instead, the entirety of the evidence seems to consist of a tiny quantity of rather doubtful documentary material, the dubious interpretations of certain phrases, and various German confessions, often obtained under brutal torture.\\n\\nGiven his crucial wartime role in Military Intelligence, John Beaty [The Iron Curtain Over America] was particularly harsh in his denunciation of the proceedings, and the numerous top American generals who endorsed his book add considerably to the weight of his verdict:\\n\\nBy contrast, Irving notes that if the Allies had instead been in the dock at Nuremberg, the evidence of their guilt would have been absolutely overwhelming. After all, it was Churchill who began the illegal terror-bombing of cities, a strategy deliberately intended to provoke German retaliation and which eventually led to the death of a million or more European civilians.\\n\\nLate in the war, military reversals had even persuaded the British leader to order similarly illegal poison gas attacks against German cities, along with the initiation of even more horrific biological warfare involving anthrax bombs. Irving located these signed directives in the British archives, although Churchill was later persuaded to countermand them before they were carried out. By contrast, German archival material demonstrates that Hitler had repeatedly ruled out any first use of such illegal weapons under any circumstances, even though Germany\\u2019s far deadlier arsenal might have turned the tide of the war in its favor.\\n\\nAlthough long forgotten today, Freda Utley was a mid-century journalist of some prominence.

Dwight Eisenhower as the central culprit behind the tragedy, noting the far lower POW losses in areas outside his control, and suggests that as a highly ambitious \\u201cpolitical general\\u201d of German-American ancestry, he may have been under intense pressure to demonstrate his \\u201charshness\\u201d toward the defeated Wehrmacht foe. Furthermore, once the Cold War ended and the Soviet Archives were open to scholars, their contents seem to have strongly validated Bacque\\u2019s thesis. He notes that although the archives do contain explicit evidence of such long-denied atrocities as Stalin\\u2019s Katyn Forest massacre of Poland\\u2019s officer corps, they show absolutely no signs of any million missing German POWs, who instead had very likely ended their lives in the starvation and illness of Eisenhower\\u2019s death camps. Bacque points out that the German government has issued severe legal threats against anyone seeking to investigate the likely sites of the mass graves that might hold the remains of those long-dead POWs, and in an updated edition, he also mentions Germany\\u2019s enactment of harsh new laws meting out heavy prison sentences to anyone who merely questions the official narrative of World War II. Bacque\\u2019s discussion of the new evidence of the Kremlin archives constitutes a relatively small portion of his 1997 sequel, Crimes and Mercies, which centered around an even more explosive analysis, and also became an international best-seller. As described above, first-hand observers of post-war Germany in 1947 and 1948 such as Gollanz and Utley, had directly reported on the horrific conditions they discovered, and stated that for years official food rations for the entire population had been comparable to that of the inmates of Nazi concentration camps and sometimes far lower, leading to the widespread malnutrition and illness they witnessed all around them. They also noted the destruction of most of Germany\\u2019s pre-war housing stock and the severe overcrowding produced by the influx of so many millions of pitiful ethnic German refugees expelled from other parts of Central and Eastern Europe. But these visitors lacked any access to solid population statistics, and could only speculate upon the enormous human death toll that hunger and illness had already inflicted, and which would surely continue if policies were not quickly changed. Years of archival research by Bacque attempt to answer this question, and the conclusion he provides is certainly not a pleasant one. Both the Allied military government and the later German civilian authorities seem to have made a concerted effort to hide or obscure the true scale of the calamity visited upon German civilians during the years 1945-1950, and the official mortality statistics found in government reports are simply too fantastical to possibly be correct, although they became the basis for the subsequent histories of that period. Bacque notes that these figures suggest that the death rate during the terrible conditions of 1947, long remembered as the \\u201cHunger Year\\u201d (Hungerjahr) and vividly described in Gollancz\\u2019s account, was actually lower than that of the prosperous Germany of the late 1960s. Furthermore, private reports by American officials, mortality rates from individual localities, and other strong evidence demonstrate that these long-accepted aggregate numbers were essentially fictional. Instead, Bacque attempts to provide more realistic estimates based upon an examination of the population totals of the various German censuses together with the recorded influx of the huge number of German refugees. Based upon this simple analysis, he makes a reasonably strong case that the excess German deaths during that period amounted to at least around 10 million, and possibly many millions more. Furthermore, he provides substantial evidence that the starvation was either deliberate or at least enormously worsened by American government resistance to overseas food relief efforts. Perhaps these numbers should not be so totally surprising given that the official Morgenthau Plan had envisioned the elimination of around 20 million Germans, and as Bacque demonstrates, top American leaders quietly agreed to continue that policy in practice even while they renounced it in theory. Assuming these numbers are even remotely correct, the implications are quite remarkable. The toll of the human catastrophe experienced in post-war Germany would certainly rank among the greatest in modern peacetime history, far exceeding the deaths that occurred during the Ukrainian Famine of the early 1930s and possibly even approaching the wholly unintentional losses during Mao\\u2019s Great Leap Forward of 1959-61. Furthermore, the post-war German losses would vastly outrank either of these other unfortunate events in percentage terms and this would remain true even if the Bacque\\u2019s estimates are considerably reduced. Yet I doubt if even a small fraction of one percent of Americans are today aware of this enormous human calamity. Presumably memories are much stronger in Germany itself, but given the growing legal crackdown on discordant views in that unfortunate country, I suspect that anyone who discusses the topic too energetically risks immediate imprisonment. To a considerable extent, this historical ignorance has been heavily fostered by our governments, often using underhanded or even nefarious means. Just like in the old decaying USSR, much of the current political legitimacy of today\\u2019s American government and its various European vassal-states is founded upon a particular narrative history of World War II, and challenging that narrative might produce dire political consequences. Bacque credibly relates some of the apparent efforts to dissuade any major newspaper or magazine from running articles discussing the startling findings of his first book, thereby imposing a \\u201cblackout\\u201d aimed at absolutely minimizing any media coverage. Such measures seem to have been quite effective, since until eight or nine years ago, I\\u2019m not sure I had ever heard a word of these shocking ideas, and I have certainly never seen them seriously discussed in any of the numerous newspapers or magazines that I have carefully read over the last three decades. Even illegal means were employed to hinder the efforts of this solitary, determined scholar. At times, Bacque\\u2019s phone-lines were tapped, his mail intercepted, and his research materials surreptitiously copied, while his access to some official archives was blocked. Some of the elderly eyewitnesses who personally corroborated his analysis received threatening notes and had their property vandalized. In his Foreword to this 1997 book, De Zayas, the eminent international human rights attorney, praised Bacque\\u2019s ground-breaking research, and hoped that it would soon lead to a major scholarly debate aimed at reassessing the true facts of these historical events that had taken place a half-century earlier. But in his update to the 2007 edition, he expressed some outrage that no such discussion ever occurred, and instead the German government merely passed a series of harsh laws mandating prison sentences for anyone who substantially disputed the settled narrative of World War II and its immediate aftermath, perhaps by overly focusing on the suffering of German civilians. Although both of Bacque\\u2019s books became international best-sellers, the near-complete absence of any secondary media coverage ensured that they never entered public awareness with anything more than a pinprick. Another important factor is the tremendously disproportionate reach of print and electronic media. A best-seller may be read by many tens of thousands of people, but a successful film might reach tens of millions, and so long as Hollywood churns out endless movies denouncing Germany\\u2019s atrocities but not a single one on the other side, the true facts of that history are hardly likely to gain much traction. I strongly suspect that far more people today believe in the real-life existence of Batman and Spiderman than are even aware of the Bacque Hypothesis.\\n\\nMany of the elements presented above were drawn from my previous articles published over the last year or so, but I believe there is some value in providing this same material in unified form rather than only separately, even if the total length necessarily becomes quite considerable.\\n\\nWorld War II dominates our twentieth century landscape like a colossus, and still casts huge shadows across our modern world. That global conflict has probably been the subject of far more sustained coverage, whether in print or electronic media, than any other event in human history. So if we encounter a small handful of highly anomalous items that seem to directly contradict such an ocean of enormously detailed and long-accepted information, there is a natural tendency to dismiss these few outliers as implausible or even delusional.\\n\\nBut once the total number of such discordant seemingly yet well-documented elements becomes sufficiently large, we must take them more seriously, and perhaps eventually concede that most of them are probably correct. As was suggested in a quote widely if doubtfully attributed to Stalin, \\u201cQuantity has a quality all of its own.\\u201d\\n\\nI am hardly the first individual to gradually become aware of this sweeping and cohesive counter-narrative of the Second World War, and a few months ago I happened to read Germany\\u2019s War, published in 2014 by amateur historian John Wear.\\n\\nDrawing from sources that substantially overlap with the ones I have discussed, his conclusions are reasonably similar to my own, but presented in a book length form that includes some 1,200 exact source references. So those interested in a much more detailed exposition of these same issues can read it and decide for themselves.\\n\\nWhen intellectual freedom is under attack, challenging an officially enshrined mythology may become legally perilous. I have seen claims that thousands of individuals who hold heterodox opinions about various aspects of the history of World War II are today imprisoned across Europe on the basis of those beliefs. If so, that total is probably far higher than the number of ideological dissidents who had suffered a similar fate in the decaying Soviet Bloc countries of the 1980s.\\n\\nWorld War II ended nearly three generations ago, and few of its adult survivors still walk the earth. From one perspective the true facts of that conflict and whether or not they actually contradict our traditional beliefs might appear rather irrelevant. Tearing down the statues of some long-dead historical figures and replacing them with the statues of others hardly seems of much practical value.\\n\\nBut if we gradually conclude that the story that all of us have been told during our entire lifetimes is substantially false and perhaps largely inverted, the implications for our understanding of the world are enormous. Most of the surprising material presented here is hardly hidden or kept under lock-and-key. Nearly all the books are easily available at Amazon or even freely readable on the Internet, many of the authors have received critical and scholarly acclaim, and in some cases their works have sold in the millions.\\n\\nYet this important material has been almost entirely ignored or dismissed by the popular media that shapes the common beliefs of our society. So we must necessarily begin to wonder what other massive falsehoods may have been similarly promoted by that media, perhaps involving incidents of the recent past or even the present day. And those latter events do have enormous practical significance. As I pointed out several years ago in my original American Pravda article:\\n\\nEven if the overwhelming majority of the unorthodox claims provided by such non-traditional web-based sources is incorrect, at least there now exists the possibility of extracting vital nuggets of truth from vast mountains of falsehood.\\n\\nWe must also recognize that many of the fundamental ideas that dominate our present-day world were founded upon a particular understanding of that wartime history, and if there seems good reason to believe that narrative is substantially false, perhaps we should begin questioning the framework of beliefs erected upon it.\\n\\nGeorge Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil War during the 1930s and discovered that the true facts in Spain were radically different from what he had been led to believe by the British media of his day. In 1948 these past experiences together with the rapidly congealing \\u201cofficial history\\u201d of the Second World War may have been uppermost in his mind when he published his classic novel 1984, which famously declared that \\u201cWho controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past.\\u201d\\n\\nIndeed, as I noted last year this observation has never been more true than when we consider some of the historical assumptions that govern the politics of today\\u2019s world, and the likelihood that they are entirely misleading:\\n\\nBack in those late Cold War days, the death toll of innocent civilians from the Bolshevik Revolution and the first two decades of the Soviet Regime was generally reckoned at running well into the tens of millions when we include the casualties of the Russian Civil War, the government-induced famines, the Gulag, and the executions. I\\u2019ve heard that these numbers have been substantially revised downwards to perhaps as little as twenty million or so, but no matter. Although determined Soviet apologists may dispute such very large figures, they have always been part of the standard narrative history taught within the West. Meanwhile, all historians know perfectly well that the Bolshevik leaders were overwhelmingly Jewish, with three of the five revolutionaries Lenin named as his plausible successors coming from that background. Although only around 4% of Russia\\u2019s population was Jewish, a few years ago Vladimir Putin stated that Jews constituted perhaps 80-85% of the early Soviet government, an estimate fully consistent with the contemporaneous claims of Winston Churchill, Times of London correspondent Robert Wilton, and the officers of American Military Intelligence. Recent books by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Yuri Slezkine, and others have all painted a very similar picture. And prior to World War II, Jews remained enormously over-represented in the Communist leadership, especially dominating the Gulag administration and the top ranks of the dreaded NKVD. Both of these simple facts have been widely accepted in America throughout my entire lifetime. But combine them together with the relatively tiny size of worldwide Jewry, around 16 million prior to World War II, and the inescapable conclusion is that in per capita terms Jews were the greatest mass-murderers of the twentieth century, holding that unfortunate distinction by an enormous margin and with no other nationality coming even remotely close. And yet, by the astonishing alchemy of Hollywood, the greatest killers of the last one hundred years have somehow been transmuted into being seen as the greatest victims, a transformation so seemingly implausible that future generations will surely be left gasping in awe. Today\\u2019s American Neocons are just as heavily Jewish as were the Bolsheviks of a hundred years ago, and they have greatly benefited from the political immunity provided by this totally bizarre inversion of historical reality. Partly as a consequence of their media-fabricated victimhood status, they have managed to seize control over much of our political system, especially our foreign policy, and have spent the last few years doing their utmost to foment an absolutely insane war with nuclear-armed Russia. If they do manage to achieve that unfortunate goal, they will surely outdo the very impressive human body-count racked up by their ethnic ancestors, perhaps even by an order-of-magnitude or more.\\n\\u2022 American Pravda: Our Great Purge of the 1940s http://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-our-great-purge-of-the-1940s/\", \"author\": \"Edward Morgan\", \"url\": \"https://prepareforchange.net/2020/01/23/the-ww2-war-crimes-of-churchill-and-the-americans-were-far-worse-than-hitlers/\", \"published\": \"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 19:05:04 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1579824304, \"collection_utc\": 1579824181}",News,1579824304

Revisionist historians who have actually dug up the buried evidence and examined it have made a case that whatever the Nazi crimes, they were rivaled, if not exceeded, by those of Churchill and the Americans.\\n\\nDresden before and after the fire bombing of this civilian city, devoid of any military value, except for terrorizing civilians\\n\\nUnz, a prolific reader with a knack for tying things together reviews some of the true history in what follows. To condition yourself for the coming shock, keep in mind that the same Hitler that is said to have hated Jews and systematically gassed and burnt them, had 150,000 half-and quarter-Jews serving in his armies, \\u201cmostly as combat officers, and these included at least 15 half-Jewish generals and admirals, with another dozen quarter Jews holding those same high ranks.\\n\\nThe most notable example was Field Marshal Erhard Milch, Hermann Goering\\u2019s powerful second-in-command, who played such an important operational role in creating the Luftwaffe. Milch certainly had a Jewish father, and according to some much less substantiated claims, perhaps even a Jewish mother as well, while his sister was married to an SS general.\\u201d\\n\\nWhen truth-tellers rattle our cages, we get upset over having our comfortable make-believe world disturbed and shout invectives. Rather than condemn the messanger, the more mature response would be to condemn those who lied to us and institutionalized false history into our consciousness. Keep in mind that the few who tell you the truth pay a high price for doing so; therefore, you should refrain from adding your invective to the copious amount heaped on them by the Establishment.\\n\\nThink about it. Which is your true friend, the one who tells you the truth, or the one who controls the explanations you receive in order to advance his own agenda?\\n\\nI again state my admiration of Ron Unz. He is Jewish. He is highly intelligent. He is a Harvard graduate. He is an entrepreneur who made himself a multi-millionaire. He could have held his fire and risen to the top of the establishment. Instead, he chose to tell us the truth. Ron Unz is the person who should be President. Unlike Trump, Unz would know how to staff a government that would put truth and morality back in charge of our future.\\n\\nHere is Ron Unz weighing for us the historical evidence on who was the worst war criminal. The emphasis is added:\\n\\nFor most present-day Americans, the primary image associated with Hitler and his German regime is the horrendous scale of the war-crimes that they supposedly committed during the global conflict that they are alleged to have unleashed. But in one of his lectures, Irving made the rather telling observation that the relative scale of such World War II crimes and especially their evidentiary base might not necessarily point in the direction of implicating the Germans.\\n\\nAlthough Hollywood and those in its thrall have endlessly cited the findings of the Nuremberg Tribunals as the final word on Nazi barbarism, even a cursory examination of those proceedings raises enormous skepticism.\\n\\nAs time passed, historians gradually acknowledged that some of the most shocking and lurid pieces of evidence used to secure worldwide condemnation of the defendants\\u2014the human lampshades and bars of soap, the shrunken heads\\u2014were entirely fraudulent.\\n\\nThe Soviets were determined to prosecute the Nazis for the Katyn Forest massacre of the captured Polish officer corps even though the Western Allies were convinced that Stalin had actually been responsible, a belief eventually confirmed by Gorbachev and the newly-opened Soviet archives. If the Germans had actually done so many horrible things, one wonders why the prosecution would have bothered including such fabricated and false charges.\\n\\nAnd over the decades, considerable evidence has accumulated that the Gas Chambers and the Jewish Holocaust\\u2014the central elements of today\\u2019s Nazi \\u201cBlack Legend\\u201d\\u2014were just as fictional as all those other items.\\n\\nThe Germans were notoriously meticulous record-keepers, embracing orderly bureaucracy like no other people, and nearly all their archives were captured at the end of the war. Under these circumstances, it seems rather odd that there are virtually no traces of the plans or directives associated with the monstrous crimes that their leadership supposedly ordered committed in such massively industrial fashion. Instead, the entirety of the evidence seems to consist of a tiny quantity of rather doubtful documentary material, the dubious interpretations of certain phrases, and various German confessions, often obtained under brutal torture.\\n\\nGiven his crucial wartime role in Military Intelligence, John Beaty [The Iron Curtain Over America] was particularly harsh in his denunciation of the proceedings, and the numerous top American generals who endorsed his book add considerably to the weight of his verdict:\\n\\nBy contrast, Irving notes that if the Allies had instead been in the dock at Nuremberg, the evidence of their guilt would have been absolutely overwhelming. After all, it was Churchill who began the illegal terror-bombing of cities, a strategy deliberately intended to provoke German retaliation and which eventually led to the death of a million or more European civilians.\\n\\nLate in the war, military reversals had even persuaded the British leader to order similarly illegal poison gas attacks against German cities, along with the initiation of even more horrific biological warfare involving anthrax bombs. Irving located these signed directives in the British archives, although Churchill was later persuaded to countermand them before they were carried out. By contrast, German archival material demonstrates that Hitler had repeatedly ruled out any first use of such illegal weapons under any circumstances, even though Germany\\u2019s far deadlier arsenal might have turned the tide of the war in its favor.\\n\\nAlthough long forgotten today, Freda Utley was a mid-century journalist of some prominence. Born an Englishwoman, she had married a Jewish Communist and moved to Soviet Russia, then fled to America after her husband fell in one of Stalin\\u2019s purges.\\n\\nAlthough hardly sympathetic to the defeated Nazis, she strongly shared Beaty\\u2019s view of the monstrous perversion of justice at Nuremberg and her first-hand account of the months spent in Occupied Germany is eye-opening in its description of the horrific suffering imposed upon the prostrate population even years after the end of the war. Moreover:\\n\\nThe population movement certainly seems to have represented the largest ethnic-cleansing in the history of the world, and if the Germany had ever done anything even remotely similar during its years of European victories and conquests, the visually-gripping scenes of such an enormous flood of desperate, trudging refugees would surely have become a centerpiece of numerous World War II movies of the last seventy years. But since nothing like that ever happened, Hollywood screenwriters lost a tremendous opportunity.\\n\\nI think perhaps the most plausible explanation for the widespread promotion of a multitude of largely fictional German war-crimes at Nuremberg was to the camouflage and obscure the very real ones actually committed by the Allies.\\n\\nOther related indicators may be found in the extreme tone of some of the American publications of the period, even those produced well before our country even entered the war. For example:\\n\\nSurely any such similar book published in Hitler\\u2019s Germany that advocated the extermination of all Jews or Slavs would have been a centerpiece at Nuremberg, and any newspaper reviewers who had treated it favorably would probably have stood in the dock for \\u201ccrimes against humanity.\\u201d\\n\\nMeanwhile, the terrible nature of the Pacific War fought in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor is suggested by a 1944 issue of Life magazine that carried the photo of a young American woman with the skull of a Japanese soldier her boyfriend had sent her as a war souvenir. If any Nazi magazines ever featured similar images, I doubt the Allies would have had any need to fabricate ridiculous stories of human lampshades or soap.\\n\\nAnd remarkably enough, that grotesque scene actually provides a reasonably accurate indication of the savage atrocities that were regularly committed during the brutal fighting of the Pacific Theater. These unpleasant facts were fully set forth in War Without Mercy, an award-winning 1986 volume by eminent American historian John W. Dower that received glowing accolades by leading scholars and public intellectuals.\\n\\nThe unfortunate truth is that Americans typically massacred Japanese who sought to surrender or who had even already been taken as prisoners, with the result that only a small slice\\u2014during some years merely a tiny sliver\\u2014of Japanese troops defeated in battle ever survived.\\n\\nThe traditional excuse publicly offered for the virtual absence of any Japanese POWs was that their Bushido code made surrender unthinkable, yet when the Soviets defeated Japanese armies in 1945, they had no difficulty capturing over a million prisoners. Indeed, since interrogating prisoners was important for intelligence purposes, late in the war U.S. commanders began offering rewards such as ice cream to their troops for bringing some surrendering Japanese in alive rather than killing them in the field.\\n\\nAmerican GIs also regularly committed remarkably savage atrocities. Dead or wounded Japanese frequently had their gold teeth knocked out and taken as war-booty, and their ears were often cut-off and kept as souvenirs, as was also sometimes the case with their skulls. Meanwhile, Dower notes the absence of any evidence suggesting similar behavior on the other side.\\n\\nThe American media generally portrayed the Japanese as vermin fit for eradication, and numerous public statements by high-ranking American military leaders explicitly claimed that the bulk of the entire Japanese population would probably need to be exterminated in order to bring the war to a successful conclusion. Comparing such thoroughly-documented facts with the rather tenuous accusations usually leveled against Nazi political or military leaders is quite revealing.\\n\\nDuring the late 1980s evidence of other deep wartime secrets suddenly came to light.\\n\\nWhile visiting France during 1986 in preparation for an unrelated book, a Canadian writer named James Bacque stumbled upon clues suggesting that one of the most terrible secrets of post-war Germany had long remained completely hidden, and he soon embarked upon extensive research into the subject, finally publishing Other Losses in 1989. Based upon very considerable evidence, including government records, personal interviews, and recorded eyewitness testimony, he argued that after the end of the war, the Americans had starved to death as many as a million German POWs, seemingly as a deliberate act of policy, a war crime that would surely rank among the greatest in history. For decades, Western propagandists had relentlessly barraged the Soviets with claims that they were keeping back a million or more \\u201cmissing\\u201d German POWs as slave-laborers in their Gulag, while the Soviets had endlessly denied these accusations. According to Bacque, the Soviets had been telling the truth all along, and the missing soldiers had been among the enormous numbers who had fled westward near the end of the war, seeking what they assumed would be far better treatment at the hands of the advancing Anglo-American armies. But instead, they were denied all normal legal protections, and confined under horrible conditions where they rapidly perished of hunger, illness, and exposure. Without attempting to summarize Bacque\\u2019s extensive accumulation of supporting material, a few of his factual elements are worth mentioning. At the close of hostilities, the American government employed circuitous legal reasoning to argue that the many millions of German troops that they had captured should not be considered \\u201cprisoners of war\\u201d and therefore were not covered by the provisions of the Geneva Convention. Soon afterward, attempts by the International Red Cross to provide food shipments to the enormous Allied prison camps were repeatedly rejected, and notices were posted throughout the nearby German towns and villages that any civilian who attempted to smuggle food to the desperate POWs might be shot on sight. These undeniable historical facts do seem to suggest certain dark possibilities. Although initially released by an obscure publisher, Bacque\\u2019s book soon became a sensation and an international best-seller. He paints Gen. Dwight Eisenhower as the central culprit behind the tragedy, noting the far lower POW losses in areas outside his control, and suggests that as a highly ambitious \\u201cpolitical general\\u201d of German-American ancestry, he may have been under intense pressure to demonstrate his \\u201charshness\\u201d toward the defeated Wehrmacht foe. Furthermore, once the Cold War ended and the Soviet Archives were open to scholars, their contents seem to have strongly validated Bacque\\u2019s thesis. He notes that although the archives do contain explicit evidence of such long-denied atrocities as Stalin\\u2019s Katyn Forest massacre of Poland\\u2019s officer corps, they show absolutely no signs of any million missing German POWs, who instead had very likely ended their lives in the starvation and illness of Eisenhower\\u2019s death camps. Bacque points out that the German government has issued severe legal threats against anyone seeking to investigate the likely sites of the mass graves that might hold the remains of those long-dead POWs, and in an updated edition, he also mentions Germany\\u2019s enactment of harsh new laws meting out heavy prison sentences to anyone who merely questions the official narrative of World War II. Bacque\\u2019s discussion of the new evidence of the Kremlin archives constitutes a relatively small portion of his 1997 sequel, Crimes and Mercies, which centered around an even more explosive analysis, and also became an international best-seller. As described above, first-hand observers of post-war Germany in 1947 and 1948 such as Gollanz and Utley, had directly reported on the horrific conditions they discovered, and stated that for years official food rations for the entire population had been comparable to that of the inmates of Nazi concentration camps and sometimes far lower, leading to the widespread malnutrition and illness they witnessed all around them. They also noted the destruction of most of Germany\\u2019s pre-war housing stock and the severe overcrowding produced by the influx of so many millions of pitiful ethnic German refugees expelled from other parts of Central and Eastern Europe. But these visitors lacked any access to solid population statistics, and could only speculate upon the enormous human death toll that hunger and illness had already inflicted, and which would surely continue if policies were not quickly changed. Years of archival research by Bacque attempt to answer this question, and the conclusion he provides is certainly not a pleasant one. Both the Allied military government and the later German civilian authorities seem to have made a concerted effort to hide or obscure the true scale of the calamity visited upon German civilians during the years 1945-1950, and the official mortality statistics found in government reports are simply too fantastical to possibly be correct, although they became the basis for the subsequent histories of that period. Bacque notes that these figures suggest that the death rate during the terrible conditions of 1947, long remembered as the \\u201cHunger Year\\u201d (Hungerjahr) and vividly described in Gollancz\\u2019s account, was actually lower than that of the prosperous Germany of the late 1960s. Furthermore, private reports by American officials, mortality rates from individual localities, and other strong evidence demonstrate that these long-accepted aggregate numbers were essentially fictional. Instead, Bacque attempts to provide more realistic estimates based upon an examination of the population totals of the various German censuses together with the recorded influx of the huge number of German refugees. Based upon this simple analysis, he makes a reasonably strong case that the excess German deaths during that period amounted to at least around 10 million, and possibly many millions more. Furthermore, he provides substantial evidence that the starvation was either deliberate or at least enormously worsened by American government resistance to overseas food relief efforts. Perhaps these numbers should not be so totally surprising given that the official Morgenthau Plan had envisioned the elimination of around 20 million Germans, and as Bacque demonstrates, top American leaders quietly agreed to continue that policy in practice even while they renounced it in theory. Assuming these numbers are even remotely correct, the implications are quite remarkable. The toll of the human catastrophe experienced in post-war Germany would certainly rank among the greatest in modern peacetime history, far exceeding the deaths that occurred during the Ukrainian Famine of the early 1930s and possibly even approaching the wholly unintentional losses during Mao\\u2019s Great Leap Forward of 1959-61. Furthermore, the post-war German losses would vastly outrank either of these other unfortunate events in percentage terms and this would remain true even if the Bacque\\u2019s estimates are considerably reduced. Yet I doubt if even a small fraction of one percent of Americans are today aware of this enormous human calamity. Presumably memories are much stronger in Germany itself, but given the growing legal crackdown on discordant views in that unfortunate country, I suspect that anyone who discusses the topic too energetically risks immediate imprisonment. To a considerable extent, this historical ignorance has been heavily fostered by our governments, often using underhanded or even nefarious means. Just like in the old decaying USSR, much of the current political legitimacy of today\\u2019s American government and its various European vassal-states is founded upon a particular narrative history of World War II, and challenging that narrative might produce dire political consequences. Bacque credibly relates some of the apparent efforts to dissuade any major newspaper or magazine from running articles discussing the startling findings of his first book, thereby imposing a \\u201cblackout\\u201d aimed at absolutely minimizing any media coverage. Such measures seem to have been quite effective, since until eight or nine years ago, I\\u2019m not sure I had ever heard a word of these shocking ideas, and I have certainly never seen them seriously discussed in any of the numerous newspapers or magazines that I have carefully read over the last three decades. Even illegal means were employed to hinder the efforts of this solitary, determined scholar. At times, Bacque\\u2019s phone-lines were tapped, his mail intercepted, and his research materials surreptitiously copied, while his access to some official archives was blocked. Some of the elderly eyewitnesses who personally corroborated his analysis received threatening notes and had their property vandalized. In his Foreword to this 1997 book, De Zayas, the eminent international human rights attorney, praised Bacque\\u2019s ground-breaking research, and hoped that it would soon lead to a major scholarly debate aimed at reassessing the true facts of these historical events that had taken place a half-century earlier. But in his update to the 2007 edition, he expressed some outrage that no such discussion ever occurred, and instead the German government merely passed a series of harsh laws mandating prison sentences for anyone who substantially disputed the settled narrative of World War II and its immediate aftermath, perhaps by overly focusing on the suffering of German civilians. Although both of Bacque\\u2019s books became international best-sellers, the near-complete absence of any secondary media coverage ensured that they never entered public awareness with anything more than a pinprick. Another important factor is the tremendously disproportionate reach of print and electronic media. A best-seller may be read by many tens of thousands of people, but a successful film might reach tens of millions, and so long as Hollywood churns out endless movies denouncing Germany\\u2019s atrocities but not a single one on the other side, the true facts of that history are hardly likely to gain much traction. I strongly suspect that far more people today believe in the real-life existence of Batman and Spiderman than are even aware of the Bacque Hypothesis.\\n\\nMany of the elements presented above were drawn from my previous articles published over the last year or so, but I believe there is some value in providing this same material in unified form rather than only separately, even if the total length necessarily becomes quite considerable.\\n\\nWorld War II dominates our twentieth century landscape like a colossus, and still casts huge shadows across our modern world. That global conflict has probably been the subject of far more sustained coverage, whether in print or electronic media, than any other event in human history. So if we encounter a small handful of highly anomalous items that seem to directly contradict such an ocean of enormously detailed and long-accepted information, there is a natural tendency to dismiss these few outliers as implausible or even delusional.\\n\\nBut once the total number of such discordant seemingly yet well-documented elements becomes sufficiently large, we must take them more seriously, and perhaps eventually concede that most of them are probably correct. As was suggested in a quote widely if doubtfully attributed to Stalin, \\u201cQuantity has a quality all of its own.\\u201d\\n\\nI am hardly the first individual to gradually become aware of this sweeping and cohesive counter-narrative of the Second World War, and a few months ago I happened to read Germany\\u2019s War, published in 2014 by amateur historian John Wear.\\n\\nDrawing from sources that substantially overlap with the ones I have discussed, his conclusions are reasonably similar to my own, but presented in a book length form that includes some 1,200 exact source references. So those interested in a much more detailed exposition of these same issues can read it and decide for themselves.\\n\\nWhen intellectual freedom is under attack, challenging an officially enshrined mythology may become legally perilous. I have seen claims that thousands of individuals who hold heterodox opinions about various aspects of the history of World War II are today imprisoned across Europe on the basis of those beliefs. If so, that total is probably far higher than the number of ideological dissidents who had suffered a similar fate in the decaying Soviet Bloc countries of the 1980s.\\n\\nWorld War II ended nearly three generations ago, and few of its adult survivors still walk the earth. From one perspective the true facts of that conflict and whether or not they actually contradict our traditional beliefs might appear rather irrelevant. Tearing down the statues of some long-dead historical figures and replacing them with the statues of others hardly seems of much practical value.\\n\\nBut if we gradually conclude that the story that all of us have been told during our entire lifetimes is substantially false and perhaps largely inverted, the implications for our understanding of the world are enormous. Most of the surprising material presented here is hardly hidden or kept under lock-and-key. Nearly all the books are easily available at Amazon or even freely readable on the Internet, many of the authors have received critical and scholarly acclaim, and in some cases their works have sold in the millions.\\n\\nYet this important material has been almost entirely ignored or dismissed by the popular media that shapes the common beliefs of our society. So we must necessarily begin to wonder what other massive falsehoods may have been similarly promoted by that media, perhaps involving incidents of the recent past or even the present day. And those latter events do have enormous practical significance. As I pointed out several years ago in my original American Pravda article:\\n\\nEven if the overwhelming majority of the unorthodox claims provided by such non-traditional web-based sources is incorrect, at least there now exists the possibility of extracting vital nuggets of truth from vast mountains of falsehood.\\n\\nWe must also recognize that many of the fundamental ideas that dominate our present-day world were founded upon a particular understanding of that wartime history, and if there seems good reason to believe that narrative is substantially false, perhaps we should begin questioning the framework of beliefs erected upon it.\\n\\nGeorge Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil War during the 1930s and discovered that the true facts in Spain were radically different from what he had been led to believe by the British media of his day. In 1948 these past experiences together with the rapidly congealing \\u201cofficial history\\u201d of the Second World War may have been uppermost in his mind when he published his classic novel 1984, which famously declared that \\u201cWho controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past.\\u201d\\n\\nIndeed, as I noted last year this observation has never been more true than when we consider some of the historical assumptions that govern the politics of today\\u2019s world, and the likelihood that they are entirely misleading:\\n\\nBack in those late Cold War days, the death toll of innocent civilians from the Bolshevik Revolution and the first two decades of the Soviet Regime was generally reckoned at running well into the tens of millions when we include the casualties of the Russian Civil War, the government-induced famines, the Gulag, and the executions. I\\u2019ve heard that these numbers have been substantially revised downwards to perhaps as little as twenty million or so, but no matter. Although determined Soviet apologists may dispute such very large figures, they have always been part of the standard narrative history taught within the West. Meanwhile, all historians know perfectly well that the Bolshevik leaders were overwhelmingly Jewish, with three of the five revolutionaries Lenin named as his plausible successors coming from that background. Although only around 4% of Russia\\u2019s population was Jewish, a few years ago Vladimir Putin stated that Jews constituted perhaps 80-85% of the early Soviet government, an estimate fully consistent with the contemporaneous claims of Winston Churchill, Times of London correspondent Robert Wilton, and the officers of American Military Intelligence. Recent books by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Yuri Slezkine, and others have all painted a very similar picture. And prior to World War II, Jews remained enormously over-represented in the Communist leadership, especially dominating the Gulag administration and the top ranks of the dreaded NKVD. Both of these simple facts have been widely accepted in America throughout my entire lifetime. But combine them together with the relatively tiny size of worldwide Jewry, around 16 million prior to World War II, and the inescapable conclusion is that in per capita terms Jews were the greatest mass-murderers of the twentieth century, holding that unfortunate distinction by an enormous margin and with no other nationality coming even remotely close. And yet, by the astonishing alchemy of Hollywood, the greatest killers of the last one hundred years have somehow been transmuted into being seen as the greatest victims, a transformation so seemingly implausible that future generations will surely be left gasping in awe. Today\\u2019s American Neocons are just as heavily Jewish as were the Bolsheviks of a hundred years ago, and they have greatly benefited from the political immunity provided by this totally bizarre inversion of historical reality. Partly as a consequence of their media-fabricated victimhood status, they have managed to seize control over much of our political system, especially our foreign policy, and have spent the last few years doing their utmost to foment an absolutely insane war with nuclear-armed Russia. If they do manage to achieve that unfortunate goal, they will surely outdo the very impressive human body-count racked up by their ethnic ancestors, perhaps even by an order-of-magnitude or more.\\n\\u2022 American Pravda: Our Great Purge of the 1940s http://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-our-great-purge-of-the-1940s/\", \"author\": \"Edward Morgan\", \"url\": \"https://prepareforchange.net/2020/01/23/the-ww2-war-crimes-of-churchill-and-the-americans-were-far-worse-than-hitlers/\", \"published\": \"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 19:05:04 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1579824304, \"collection_utc\": 1579824181}",News,1579824304

Revisionist historians who have actually dug up the buried evidence and examined it have made a case that whatever the Nazi crimes, they were rivaled, if not exceeded, by those of Churchill and the Americans.\\n\\nDresden before and after the fire bombing of this civilian city, devoid of any military value, except for terrorizing civilians\\n\\nUnz, a prolific reader with a knack for tying things together reviews some of the true history in what follows. To condition yourself for the coming shock, keep in mind that the same Hitler that is said to have hated Jews and systematically gassed and burnt them, had 150,000 half-and quarter-Jews serving in his armies, \\u201cmostly as combat officers, and these included at least 15 half-Jewish generals and admirals, with another dozen quarter Jews holding those same high ranks.\\n\\nThe most notable example was Field Marshal Erhard Milch, Hermann Goering\\u2019s powerful second-in-command, who played such an important operational role in creating the Luftwaffe. Milch certainly had a Jewish father, and according to some much less substantiated claims, perhaps even a Jewish mother as well, while his sister was married to an SS general.\\u201d\\n\\nWhen truth-tellers rattle our cages, we get upset over having our comfortable make-believe world disturbed and shout invectives. Rather than condemn the messanger, the more mature response would be to condemn those who lied to us and institutionalized false history into our consciousness. Keep in mind that the few who tell you the truth pay a high price for doing so; therefore, you should refrain from adding your invective to the copious amount heaped on them by the Establishment.\\n\\nThink about it. Which is your true friend, the one who tells you the truth, or the one who controls the explanations you receive in order to advance his own agenda?\\n\\nI again state my admiration of Ron Unz. He is Jewish. He is highly intelligent. He is a Harvard graduate. He is an entrepreneur who made himself a multi-millionaire. He could have held his fire and risen to the top of the establishment. Instead, he chose to tell us the truth. Ron Unz is the person who should be President. Unlike Trump, Unz would know how to staff a government that would put truth and morality back in charge of our future.\\n\\nHere is Ron Unz weighing for us the historical evidence on who was the worst war criminal. The emphasis is added:\\n\\nFor most present-day Americans, the primary image associated with Hitler and his German regime is the horrendous scale of the war-crimes that they supposedly committed during the global conflict that they are alleged to have unleashed. But in one of his lectures, Irving made the rather telling observation that the relative scale of such World War II crimes and especially their evidentiary base might not necessarily point in the direction of implicating the Germans.\\n\\nAlthough Hollywood and those in its thrall have endlessly cited the findings of the Nuremberg Tribunals as the final word on Nazi barbarism, even a cursory examination of those proceedings raises enormous skepticism.\\n\\nAs time passed, historians gradually acknowledged that some of the most shocking and lurid pieces of evidence used to secure worldwide condemnation of the defendants\\u2014the human lampshades and bars of soap, the shrunken heads\\u2014were entirely fraudulent.\\n\\nThe Soviets were determined to prosecute the Nazis for the Katyn Forest massacre of the captured Polish officer corps even though the Western Allies were convinced that Stalin had actually been responsible, a belief eventually confirmed by Gorbachev and the newly-opened Soviet archives. If the Germans had actually done so many horrible things, one wonders why the prosecution would have bothered including such fabricated and false charges.\\n\\nAnd over the decades, considerable evidence has accumulated that the Gas Chambers and the Jewish Holocaust\\u2014the central elements of today\\u2019s Nazi \\u201cBlack Legend\\u201d\\u2014were just as fictional as all those other items.\\n\\nThe Germans were notoriously meticulous record-keepers, embracing orderly bureaucracy like no other people, and nearly all their archives were captured at the end of the war. Under these circumstances, it seems rather odd that there are virtually no traces of the plans or directives associated with the monstrous crimes that their leadership supposedly ordered committed in such massively industrial fashion. Instead, the entirety of the evidence seems to consist of a tiny quantity of rather doubtful documentary material, the dubious interpretations of certain phrases, and various German confessions, often obtained under brutal torture.\\n\\nGiven his crucial wartime role in Military Intelligence, John Beaty [The Iron Curtain Over America] was particularly harsh in his denunciation of the proceedings, and the numerous top American generals who endorsed his book add considerably to the weight of his verdict:\\n\\nBy contrast, Irving notes that if the Allies had instead been in the dock at Nuremberg, the evidence of their guilt would have been absolutely overwhelming. After all, it was Churchill who began the illegal terror-bombing of cities, a strategy deliberately intended to provoke German retaliation and which eventually led to the death of a million or more European civilians.\\n\\nLate in the war, military reversals had even persuaded the British leader to order similarly illegal poison gas attacks against German cities, along with the initiation of even more horrific biological warfare involving anthrax bombs. Irving located these signed directives in the British archives, although Churchill was later persuaded to countermand them before they were carried out. By contrast, German archival material demonstrates that Hitler had repeatedly ruled out any first use of such illegal weapons under any circumstances, even though Germany\\u2019s far deadlier arsenal might have turned the tide of the war in its favor.\\n\\nAlthough long forgotten today, Freda Utley was a mid-century journalist of some prominence. Born an Englishwoman, she had married a Jewish Communist and moved to Soviet Russia, then fled to America after her husband fell in one of Stalin\\u2019s purges.\\n\\nAlthough hardly sympathetic to the defeated Nazis, she strongly shared Beaty\\u2019s view of the monstrous perversion of justice at Nuremberg and her first-hand account of the months spent in Occupied Germany is eye-opening in its description of the horrific suffering imposed upon the prostrate population even years after the end of the war. Moreover:\\n\\nThe population movement certainly seems to have represented the largest ethnic-cleansing in the history of the world, and if the Germany had ever done anything even remotely similar during its years of European victories and conquests, the visually-gripping scenes of such an enormous flood of desperate, trudging refugees would surely have become a centerpiece of numerous World War II movies of the last seventy years. But since nothing like that ever happened, Hollywood screenwriters lost a tremendous opportunity.\\n\\nI think perhaps the most plausible explanation for the widespread promotion of a multitude of largely fictional German war-crimes at Nuremberg was to the camouflage and obscure the very real ones actually committed by the Allies.\\n\\nOther related indicators may be found in the extreme tone of some of the American publications of the period, even those produced well before our country even entered the war. For example:\\n\\nSurely any such similar book published in Hitler\\u2019s Germany that advocated the extermination of all Jews or Slavs would have been a centerpiece at Nuremberg, and any newspaper reviewers who had treated it favorably would probably have stood in the dock for \\u201ccrimes against humanity.\\u201d\\n\\nMeanwhile, the terrible nature of the Pacific War fought in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor is suggested by a 1944 issue of Life magazine that carried the photo of a young American woman with the skull of a Japanese soldier her boyfriend had sent her as a war souvenir. If any Nazi magazines ever featured similar images, I doubt the Allies would have had any need to fabricate ridiculous stories of human lampshades or soap.\\n\\nAnd remarkably enough, that grotesque scene actually provides a reasonably accurate indication of the savage atrocities that were regularly committed during the brutal fighting of the Pacific Theater. These unpleasant facts were fully set forth in War Without Mercy, an award-winning 1986 volume by eminent American historian John W. Dower that received glowing accolades by leading scholars and public intellectuals.\\n\\nThe unfortunate truth is that Americans typically massacred Japanese who sought to surrender or who had even already been taken as prisoners, with the result that only a small slice\\u2014during some years merely a tiny sliver\\u2014of Japanese troops defeated in battle ever survived.\\n\\nThe traditional excuse publicly offered for the virtual absence of any Japanese POWs was that their Bushido code made surrender unthinkable, yet when the Soviets defeated Japanese armies in 1945, they had no difficulty capturing over a million prisoners. Indeed, since interrogating prisoners was important for intelligence purposes, late in the war U.S. commanders began offering rewards such as ice cream to their troops for bringing some surrendering Japanese in alive rather than killing them in the field.\\n\\nAmerican GIs also regularly committed remarkably savage atrocities. Dead or wounded Japanese frequently had their gold teeth knocked out and taken as war-booty, and their ears were often cut-off and kept as souvenirs, as was also sometimes the case with their skulls. Meanwhile, Dower notes the absence of any evidence suggesting similar behavior on the other side.\\n\\nThe American media generally portrayed the Japanese as vermin fit for eradication, and numerous public statements by high-ranking American military leaders explicitly claimed that the bulk of the entire Japanese population would probably need to be exterminated in order to bring the war to a successful conclusion. Comparing such thoroughly-documented facts with the rather tenuous accusations usually leveled against Nazi political or military leaders is quite revealing.\\n\\nDuring the late 1980s evidence of other deep wartime secrets suddenly came to light.\\n\\nWhile visiting France during 1986 in preparation for an unrelated book, a Canadian writer named James Bacque stumbled upon clues suggesting that one of the most terrible secrets of post-war Germany had long remained completely hidden, and he soon embarked upon extensive research into the subject, finally publishing Other Losses in 1989. Based upon very considerable evidence, including government records, personal interviews, and recorded eyewitness testimony, he argued that after the end of the war, the Americans had starved to death as many as a million German POWs, seemingly as a deliberate act of policy, a war crime that would surely rank among the greatest in history. For decades, Western propagandists had relentlessly barraged the Soviets with claims that they were keeping back a million or more \\u201cmissing\\u201d German POWs as slave-laborers in their Gulag, while the Soviets had endlessly denied these accusations. According to Bacque, the Soviets had been telling the truth all along, and the missing soldiers had been among the enormous numbers who had fled westward near the end of the war, seeking what they assumed would be far better treatment at the hands of the advancing Anglo-American armies. But instead, they were denied all normal legal protections, and confined under horrible conditions where they rapidly perished of hunger, illness, and exposure. Without attempting to summarize Bacque\\u2019s extensive accumulation of supporting material, a few of his factual elements are worth mentioning. At the close of hostilities, the American government employed circuitous legal reasoning to argue that the many millions of German troops that they had captured should not be considered \\u201cprisoners of war\\u201d and therefore were not covered by the provisions of the Geneva Convention. Soon afterward, attempts by the International Red Cross to provide food shipments to the enormous Allied prison camps were repeatedly rejected, and notices were posted throughout the nearby German towns and villages that any civilian who attempted to smuggle food to the desperate POWs might be shot on sight. These undeniable historical facts do seem to suggest certain dark possibilities. Although initially released by an obscure publisher, Bacque\\u2019s book soon became a sensation and an international best-seller. He paints Gen. Dwight Eisenhower as the central culprit behind the tragedy, noting the far lower POW losses in areas outside his control, and suggests that as a highly ambitious \\u201cpolitical general\\u201d of German-American ancestry, he may have been under intense pressure to demonstrate his \\u201charshness\\u201d toward the defeated Wehrmacht foe. Furthermore, once the Cold War ended and the Soviet Archives were open to scholars, their contents seem to have strongly validated Bacque\\u2019s thesis. He notes that although the archives do contain explicit evidence of such long-denied atrocities as Stalin\\u2019s Katyn Forest massacre of Poland\\u2019s officer corps, they show absolutely no signs of any million missing German POWs, who instead had very likely ended their lives in the starvation and illness of Eisenhower\\u2019s death camps. Bacque points out that the German government has issued severe legal threats against anyone seeking to investigate the likely sites of the mass graves that might hold the remains of those long-dead POWs, and in an updated edition, he also mentions Germany\\u2019s enactment of harsh new laws meting out heavy prison sentences to anyone who merely questions the official narrative of World War II. Bacque\\u2019s discussion of the new evidence of the Kremlin archives constitutes a relatively small portion of his 1997 sequel, Crimes and Mercies, which centered around an even more explosive analysis, and also became an international best-seller. As described above, first-hand observers of post-war Germany in 1947 and 1948 such as Gollanz and Utley, had directly reported on the horrific conditions they discovered, and stated that for years official food rations for the entire population had been comparable to that of the inmates of Nazi concentration camps and sometimes far lower, leading to the widespread malnutrition and illness they witnessed all around them. They also noted the destruction of most of Germany\\u2019s pre-war housing stock and the severe overcrowding produced by the influx of so many millions of pitiful ethnic German refugees expelled from other parts of Central and Eastern Europe. But these visitors lacked any access to solid population statistics, and could only speculate upon the enormous human death toll that hunger and illness had already inflicted, and which would surely continue if policies were not quickly changed. Years of archival research by Bacque attempt to answer this question, and the conclusion he provides is certainly not a pleasant one. Both the Allied military government and the later German civilian authorities seem to have made a concerted effort to hide or obscure the true scale of the calamity visited upon German civilians during the years 1945-1950, and the official mortality statistics found in government reports are simply too fantastical to possibly be correct, although they became the basis for the subsequent histories of that period. Bacque notes that these figures suggest that the death rate during the terrible conditions of 1947, long remembered as the \\u201cHunger Year\\u201d (Hungerjahr) and vividly described in Gollancz\\u2019s account, was actually lower than that of the prosperous Germany of the late 1960s. Furthermore, private reports by American officials, mortality rates from individual localities, and other strong evidence demonstrate that these long-accepted aggregate numbers were essentially fictional. Instead, Bacque attempts to provide more realistic estimates based upon an examination of the population totals of the various German censuses together with the recorded influx of the huge number of German refugees. Based upon this simple analysis, he makes a reasonably strong case that the excess German deaths during that period amounted to at least around 10 million, and possibly many millions more. Furthermore, he provides substantial evidence that the starvation was either deliberate or at least enormously worsened by American government resistance to overseas food relief efforts. Perhaps these numbers should not be so totally surprising given that the official Morgenthau Plan had envisioned the elimination of around 20 million Germans, and as Bacque demonstrates, top American leaders quietly agreed to continue that policy in practice even while they renounced it in theory. Assuming these numbers are even remotely correct, the implications are quite remarkable. The toll of the human catastrophe experienced in post-war Germany would certainly rank among the greatest in modern peacetime history, far exceeding the deaths that occurred during the Ukrainian Famine of the early 1930s and possibly even approaching the wholly unintentional losses during Mao\\u2019s Great Leap Forward of 1959-61. Furthermore, the post-war German losses would vastly outrank either of these other unfortunate events in percentage terms and this would remain true even if the Bacque\\u2019s estimates are considerably reduced. Yet I doubt if even a small fraction of one percent of Americans are today aware of this enormous human calamity. Presumably memories are much stronger in Germany itself, but given the growing legal crackdown on discordant views in that unfortunate country, I suspect that anyone who discusses the topic too energetically risks immediate imprisonment. To a considerable extent, this historical ignorance has been heavily fostered by our governments, often using underhanded or even nefarious means. Just like in the old decaying USSR, much of the current political legitimacy of today\\u2019s American government and its various European vassal-states is founded upon a particular narrative history of World War II, and challenging that narrative might produce dire political consequences. Bacque credibly relates some of the apparent efforts to dissuade any major newspaper or magazine from running articles discussing the startling findings of his first book, thereby imposing a \\u201cblackout\\u201d aimed at absolutely minimizing any media coverage. Such measures seem to have been quite effective, since until eight or nine years ago, I\\u2019m not sure I had ever heard a word of these shocking ideas, and I have certainly never seen them seriously discussed in any of the numerous newspapers or magazines that I have carefully read over the last three decades. Even illegal means were employed to hinder the efforts of this solitary, determined scholar. At times, Bacque\\u2019s phone-lines were tapped, his mail intercepted, and his research materials surreptitiously copied, while his access to some official archives was blocked. Some of the elderly eyewitnesses who personally corroborated his analysis received threatening notes and had their property vandalized. In his Foreword to this 1997 book, De Zayas, the eminent international human rights attorney, praised Bacque\\u2019s ground-breaking research, and hoped that it would soon lead to a major scholarly debate aimed at reassessing the true facts of these historical events that had taken place a half-century earlier.

Although both of Bacque\\u2019s books became international best-sellers, the near-complete absence of any secondary media coverage ensured that they never entered public awareness with anything more than a pinprick. Another important factor is the tremendously disproportionate reach of print and electronic media. A best-seller may be read by many tens of thousands of people, but a successful film might reach tens of millions, and so long as Hollywood churns out endless movies denouncing Germany\\u2019s atrocities but not a single one on the other side, the true facts of that history are hardly likely to gain much traction. I strongly suspect that far more people today believe in the real-life existence of Batman and Spiderman than are even aware of the Bacque Hypothesis.\\n\\nMany of the elements presented above were drawn from my previous articles published over the last year or so, but I believe there is some value in providing this same material in unified form rather than only separately, even if the total length necessarily becomes quite considerable.\\n\\nWorld War II dominates our twentieth century landscape like a colossus, and still casts huge shadows across our modern world.

Although determined Soviet apologists may dispute such very large figures, they have always been part of the standard narrative history taught within the West. Meanwhile, all historians know perfectly well that the Bolshevik leaders were overwhelmingly Jewish, with three of the five revolutionaries Lenin named as his plausible successors coming from that background. Although only around 4% of Russia\\u2019s population was Jewish, a few years ago Vladimir Putin stated that Jews constituted perhaps 80-85% of the early Soviet government, an estimate fully consistent with the contemporaneous claims of Winston Churchill, Times of London correspondent Robert Wilton, and the officers of American Military Intelligence. Recent books by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Yuri Slezkine, and others have all painted a very similar picture. And prior to World War II, Jews remained enormously over-represented in the Communist leadership, especially dominating the Gulag administration and the top ranks of the dreaded NKVD. Both of these simple facts have been widely accepted in America throughout my entire lifetime. But combine them together with the relatively tiny size of worldwide Jewry, around 16 million prior to World War II, and the inescapable conclusion is that in per capita terms Jews were the greatest mass-murderers of the twentieth century, holding that unfortunate distinction by an enormous margin and with no other nationality coming even remotely close. And yet, by the astonishing alchemy of Hollywood, the greatest killers of the last one hundred years have somehow been transmuted into being seen as the greatest victims, a transformation so seemingly implausible that future generations will surely be left gasping in awe. Today\\u2019s American Neocons are just as heavily Jewish as were the Bolsheviks of a hundred years ago, and they have greatly benefited from the political immunity provided by this totally bizarre inversion of historical reality. Partly as a consequence of their media-fabricated victimhood status, they have managed to seize control over much of our political system, especially our foreign policy, and have spent the last few years doing their utmost to foment an absolutely insane war with nuclear-armed Russia. If they do manage to achieve that unfortunate goal, they will surely outdo the very impressive human body-count racked up by their ethnic ancestors, perhaps even by an order-of-magnitude or more.\\n\\u2022 American Pravda: Our Great Purge of the 1940s http://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-our-great-purge-of-the-1940s/\", \"author\": \"Edward Morgan\", \"url\": \"https://prepareforchange.net/2020/01/23/the-ww2-war-crimes-of-churchill-and-the-americans-were-far-worse-than-hitlers/\", \"published\": \"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 19:05:04 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1579824304, \"collection_utc\": 1579824181}",News,1579824304

Revisionist historians who have actually dug up the buried evidence and examined it have made a case that whatever the Nazi crimes, they were rivaled, if not exceeded, by those of Churchill and the Americans.\\n\\nDresden before and after the fire bombing of this civilian city, devoid of any military value, except for terrorizing civilians\\n\\nUnz, a prolific reader with a knack for tying things together reviews some of the true history in what follows. To condition yourself for the coming shock, keep in mind that the same Hitler that is said to have hated Jews and systematically gassed and burnt them, had 150,000 half-and quarter-Jews serving in his armies, \\u201cmostly as combat officers, and these included at least 15 half-Jewish generals and admirals, with another dozen quarter Jews holding those same high ranks.\\n\\nThe most notable example was Field Marshal Erhard Milch, Hermann Goering\\u2019s powerful second-in-command, who played such an important operational role in creating the Luftwaffe. Milch certainly had a Jewish father, and according to some much less substantiated claims, perhaps even a Jewish mother as well, while his sister was married to an SS general.\\u201d\\n\\nWhen truth-tellers rattle our cages, we get upset over having our comfortable make-believe world disturbed and shout invectives. Rather than condemn the messanger, the more mature response would be to condemn those who lied to us and institutionalized false history into our consciousness. Keep in mind that the few who tell you the truth pay a high price for doing so; therefore, you should refrain from adding your invective to the copious amount heaped on them by the Establishment.\\n\\nThink about it. Which is your true friend, the one who tells you the truth, or the one who controls the explanations you receive in order to advance his own agenda?\\n\\nI again state my admiration of Ron Unz. He is Jewish. He is highly intelligent. He is a Harvard graduate. He is an entrepreneur who made himself a multi-millionaire. He could have held his fire and risen to the top of the establishment. Instead, he chose to tell us the truth. Ron Unz is the person who should be President. Unlike Trump, Unz would know how to staff a government that would put truth and morality back in charge of our future.\\n\\nHere is Ron Unz weighing for us the historical evidence on who was the worst war criminal. The emphasis is added:\\n\\nFor most present-day Americans, the primary image associated with Hitler and his German regime is the horrendous scale of the war-crimes that they supposedly committed during the global conflict that they are alleged to have unleashed. But in one of his lectures, Irving made the rather telling observation that the relative scale of such World War II crimes and especially their evidentiary base might not necessarily point in the direction of implicating the Germans.\\n\\nAlthough Hollywood and those in its thrall have endlessly cited the findings of the Nuremberg Tribunals as the final word on Nazi barbarism, even a cursory examination of those proceedings raises enormous skepticism.\\n\\nAs time passed, historians gradually acknowledged that some of the most shocking and lurid pieces of evidence used to secure worldwide condemnation of the defendants\\u2014the human lampshades and bars of soap, the shrunken heads\\u2014were entirely fraudulent.\\n\\nThe Soviets were determined to prosecute the Nazis for the Katyn Forest massacre of the captured Polish officer corps even though the Western Allies were convinced that Stalin had actually been responsible, a belief eventually confirmed by Gorbachev and the newly-opened Soviet archives. If the Germans had actually done so many horrible things, one wonders why the prosecution would have bothered including such fabricated and false charges.\\n\\nAnd over the decades, considerable evidence has accumulated that the Gas Chambers and the Jewish Holocaust\\u2014the central elements of today\\u2019s Nazi \\u201cBlack Legend\\u201d\\u2014were just as fictional as all those other items.\\n\\nThe Germans were notoriously meticulous record-keepers, embracing orderly bureaucracy like no other people, and nearly all their archives were captured at the end of the war. Under these circumstances, it seems rather odd that there are virtually no traces of the plans or directives associated with the monstrous crimes that their leadership supposedly ordered committed in such massively industrial fashion. Instead, the entirety of the evidence seems to consist of a tiny quantity of rather doubtful documentary material, the dubious interpretations of certain phrases, and various German confessions, often obtained under brutal torture.\\n\\nGiven his crucial wartime role in Military Intelligence, John Beaty [The Iron Curtain Over America] was particularly harsh in his denunciation of the proceedings, and the numerous top American generals who endorsed his book add considerably to the weight of his verdict:\\n\\nBy contrast, Irving notes that if the Allies had instead been in the dock at Nuremberg, the evidence of their guilt would have been absolutely overwhelming. After all, it was Churchill who began the illegal terror-bombing of cities, a strategy deliberately intended to provoke German retaliation and which eventually led to the death of a million or more European civilians.\\n\\nLate in the war, military reversals had even persuaded the British leader to order similarly illegal poison gas attacks against German cities, along with the initiation of even more horrific biological warfare involving anthrax bombs. Irving located these signed directives in the British archives, although Churchill was later persuaded to countermand them before they were carried out. By contrast, German archival material demonstrates that Hitler had repeatedly ruled out any first use of such illegal weapons under any circumstances, even though Germany\\u2019s far deadlier arsenal might have turned the tide of the war in its favor.\\n\\nAlthough long forgotten today, Freda Utley was a mid-century journalist of some prominence. Born an Englishwoman, she had married a Jewish Communist and moved to Soviet Russia, then fled to America after her husband fell in one of Stalin\\u2019s purges.\\n\\nAlthough hardly sympathetic to the defeated Nazis, she strongly shared Beaty\\u2019s view of the monstrous perversion of justice at Nuremberg and her first-hand account of the months spent in Occupied Germany is eye-opening in its description of the horrific suffering imposed upon the prostrate population even years after the end of the war. Moreover:\\n\\nThe population movement certainly seems to have represented the largest ethnic-cleansing in the history of the world, and if the Germany had ever done anything even remotely similar during its years of European victories and conquests, the visually-gripping scenes of such an enormous flood of desperate, trudging refugees would surely have become a centerpiece of numerous World War II movies of the last seventy years. But since nothing like that ever happened, Hollywood screenwriters lost a tremendous opportunity.\\n\\nI think perhaps the most plausible explanation for the widespread promotion of a multitude of largely fictional German war-crimes at Nuremberg was to the camouflage and obscure the very real ones actually committed by the Allies.\\n\\nOther related indicators may be found in the extreme tone of some of the American publications of the period, even those produced well before our country even entered the war. For example:\\n\\nSurely any such similar book published in Hitler\\u2019s Germany that advocated the extermination of all Jews or Slavs would have been a centerpiece at Nuremberg, and any newspaper reviewers who had treated it favorably would probably have stood in the dock for \\u201ccrimes against humanity.\\u201d\\n\\nMeanwhile, the terrible nature of the Pacific War fought in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor is suggested by a 1944 issue of Life magazine that carried the photo of a young American woman with the skull of a Japanese soldier her boyfriend had sent her as a war souvenir. If any Nazi magazines ever featured similar images, I doubt the Allies would have had any need to fabricate ridiculous stories of human lampshades or soap.\\n\\nAnd remarkably enough, that grotesque scene actually provides a reasonably accurate indication of the savage atrocities that were regularly committed during the brutal fighting of the Pacific Theater. These unpleasant facts were fully set forth in War Without Mercy, an award-winning 1986 volume by eminent American historian John W. Dower that received glowing accolades by leading scholars and public intellectuals.\\n\\nThe unfortunate truth is that Americans typically massacred Japanese who sought to surrender or who had even already been taken as prisoners, with the result that only a small slice\\u2014during some years merely a tiny sliver\\u2014of Japanese troops defeated in battle ever survived.\\n\\nThe traditional excuse publicly offered for the virtual absence of any Japanese POWs was that their Bushido code made surrender unthinkable, yet when the Soviets defeated Japanese armies in 1945, they had no difficulty capturing over a million prisoners. Indeed, since interrogating prisoners was important for intelligence purposes, late in the war U.S. commanders began offering rewards such as ice cream to their troops for bringing some surrendering Japanese in alive rather than killing them in the field.\\n\\nAmerican GIs also regularly committed remarkably savage atrocities. Dead or wounded Japanese frequently had their gold teeth knocked out and taken as war-booty, and their ears were often cut-off and kept as souvenirs, as was also sometimes the case with their skulls. Meanwhile, Dower notes the absence of any evidence suggesting similar behavior on the other side.\\n\\nThe American media generally portrayed the Japanese as vermin fit for eradication, and numerous public statements by high-ranking American military leaders explicitly claimed that the bulk of the entire Japanese population would probably need to be exterminated in order to bring the war to a successful conclusion. Comparing such thoroughly-documented facts with the rather tenuous accusations usually leveled against Nazi political or military leaders is quite revealing.\\n\\nDuring the late 1980s evidence of other deep wartime secrets suddenly came to light.\\n\\nWhile visiting France during 1986 in preparation for an unrelated book, a Canadian writer named James Bacque stumbled upon clues suggesting that one of the most terrible secrets of post-war Germany had long remained completely hidden, and he soon embarked upon extensive research into the subject, finally publishing Other Losses in 1989. Based upon very considerable evidence, including government records, personal interviews, and recorded eyewitness testimony, he argued that after the end of the war, the Americans had starved to death as many as a million German POWs, seemingly as a deliberate act of policy, a war crime that would surely rank among the greatest in history. For decades, Western propagandists had relentlessly barraged the Soviets with claims that they were keeping back a million or more \\u201cmissing\\u201d German POWs as slave-laborers in their Gulag, while the Soviets had endlessly denied these accusations. According to Bacque, the Soviets had been telling the truth all along, and the missing soldiers had been among the enormous numbers who had fled westward near the end of the war, seeking what they assumed would be far better treatment at the hands of the advancing Anglo-American armies. But instead, they were denied all normal legal protections, and confined under horrible conditions where they rapidly perished of hunger, illness, and exposure. Without attempting to summarize Bacque\\u2019s extensive accumulation of supporting material, a few of his factual elements are worth mentioning. At the close of hostilities, the American government employed circuitous legal reasoning to argue that the many millions of German troops that they had captured should not be considered \\u201cprisoners of war\\u201d and therefore were not covered by the provisions of the Geneva Convention. Soon afterward, attempts by the International Red Cross to provide food shipments to the enormous Allied prison camps were repeatedly rejected, and notices were posted throughout the nearby German towns and villages that any civilian who attempted to smuggle food to the desperate POWs might be shot on sight. These undeniable historical facts do seem to suggest certain dark possibilities. Although initially released by an obscure publisher, Bacque\\u2019s book soon became a sensation and an international best-seller. He paints Gen. Dwight Eisenhower as the central culprit behind the tragedy, noting the far lower POW losses in areas outside his control, and suggests that as a highly ambitious \\u201cpolitical general\\u201d of German-American ancestry, he may have been under intense pressure to demonstrate his \\u201charshness\\u201d toward the defeated Wehrmacht foe. Furthermore, once the Cold War ended and the Soviet Archives were open to scholars, their contents seem to have strongly validated Bacque\\u2019s thesis. He notes that although the archives do contain explicit evidence of such long-denied atrocities as Stalin\\u2019s Katyn Forest massacre of Poland\\u2019s officer corps, they show absolutely no signs of any million missing German POWs, who instead had very likely ended their lives in the starvation and illness of Eisenhower\\u2019s death camps. Bacque points out that the German government has issued severe legal threats against anyone seeking to investigate the likely sites of the mass graves that might hold the remains of those long-dead POWs, and in an updated edition, he also mentions Germany\\u2019s enactment of harsh new laws meting out heavy prison sentences to anyone who merely questions the official narrative of World War II. Bacque\\u2019s discussion of the new evidence of the Kremlin archives constitutes a relatively small portion of his 1997 sequel, Crimes and Mercies, which centered around an even more explosive analysis, and also became an international best-seller. As described above, first-hand observers of post-war Germany in 1947 and 1948 such as Gollanz and Utley, had directly reported on the horrific conditions they discovered, and stated that for years official food rations for the entire population had been comparable to that of the inmates of Nazi concentration camps and sometimes far lower, leading to the widespread malnutrition and illness they witnessed all around them. They also noted the destruction of most of Germany\\u2019s pre-war housing stock and the severe overcrowding produced by the influx of so many millions of pitiful ethnic German refugees expelled from other parts of Central and Eastern Europe. But these visitors lacked any access to solid population statistics, and could only speculate upon the enormous human death toll that hunger and illness had already inflicted, and which would surely continue if policies were not quickly changed. Years of archival research by Bacque attempt to answer this question, and the conclusion he provides is certainly not a pleasant one. Both the Allied military government and the later German civilian authorities seem to have made a concerted effort to hide or obscure the true scale of the calamity visited upon German civilians during the years 1945-1950, and the official mortality statistics found in government reports are simply too fantastical to possibly be correct, although they became the basis for the subsequent histories of that period. Bacque notes that these figures suggest that the death rate during the terrible conditions of 1947, long remembered as the \\u201cHunger Year\\u201d (Hungerjahr) and vividly described in Gollancz\\u2019s account, was actually lower than that of the prosperous Germany of the late 1960s. Furthermore, private reports by American officials, mortality rates from individual localities, and other strong evidence demonstrate that these long-accepted aggregate numbers were essentially fictional. Instead, Bacque attempts to provide more realistic estimates based upon an examination of the population totals of the various German censuses together with the recorded influx of the huge number of German refugees. Based upon this simple analysis, he makes a reasonably strong case that the excess German deaths during that period amounted to at least around 10 million, and possibly many millions more. Furthermore, he provides substantial evidence that the starvation was either deliberate or at least enormously worsened by American government resistance to overseas food relief efforts. Perhaps these numbers should not be so totally surprising given that the official Morgenthau Plan had envisioned the elimination of around 20 million Germans, and as Bacque demonstrates, top American leaders quietly agreed to continue that policy in practice even while they renounced it in theory. Assuming these numbers are even remotely correct, the implications are quite remarkable. The toll of the human catastrophe experienced in post-war Germany would certainly rank among the greatest in modern peacetime history, far exceeding the deaths that occurred during the Ukrainian Famine of the early 1930s and possibly even approaching the wholly unintentional losses during Mao\\u2019s Great Leap Forward of 1959-61. Furthermore, the post-war German losses would vastly outrank either of these other unfortunate events in percentage terms and this would remain true even if the Bacque\\u2019s estimates are considerably reduced. Yet I doubt if even a small fraction of one percent of Americans are today aware of this enormous human calamity. Presumably memories are much stronger in Germany itself, but given the growing legal crackdown on discordant views in that unfortunate country, I suspect that anyone who discusses the topic too energetically risks immediate imprisonment. To a considerable extent, this historical ignorance has been heavily fostered by our governments, often using underhanded or even nefarious means. Just like in the old decaying USSR, much of the current political legitimacy of today\\u2019s American government and its various European vassal-states is founded upon a particular narrative history of World War II, and challenging that narrative might produce dire political consequences. Bacque credibly relates some of the apparent efforts to dissuade any major newspaper or magazine from running articles discussing the startling findings of his first book, thereby imposing a \\u201cblackout\\u201d aimed at absolutely minimizing any media coverage. Such measures seem to have been quite effective, since until eight or nine years ago, I\\u2019m not sure I had ever heard a word of these shocking ideas, and I have certainly never seen them seriously discussed in any of the numerous newspapers or magazines that I have carefully read over the last three decades. Even illegal means were employed to hinder the efforts of this solitary, determined scholar. At times, Bacque\\u2019s phone-lines were tapped, his mail intercepted, and his research materials surreptitiously copied, while his access to some official archives was blocked. Some of the elderly eyewitnesses who personally corroborated his analysis received threatening notes and had their property vandalized. In his Foreword to this 1997 book, De Zayas, the eminent international human rights attorney, praised Bacque\\u2019s ground-breaking research, and hoped that it would soon lead to a major scholarly debate aimed at reassessing the true facts of these historical events that had taken place a half-century earlier. But in his update to the 2007 edition, he expressed some outrage that no such discussion ever occurred, and instead the German government merely passed a series of harsh laws mandating prison sentences for anyone who substantially disputed the settled narrative of World War II and its immediate aftermath, perhaps by overly focusing on the suffering of German civilians. Although both of Bacque\\u2019s books became international best-sellers, the near-complete absence of any secondary media coverage ensured that they never entered public awareness with anything more than a pinprick. Another important factor is the tremendously disproportionate reach of print and electronic media. A best-seller may be read by many tens of thousands of people, but a successful film might reach tens of millions, and so long as Hollywood churns out endless movies denouncing Germany\\u2019s atrocities but not a single one on the other side, the true facts of that history are hardly likely to gain much traction. I strongly suspect that far more people today believe in the real-life existence of Batman and Spiderman than are even aware of the Bacque Hypothesis.\\n\\nMany of the elements presented above were drawn from my previous articles published over the last year or so, but I believe there is some value in providing this same material in unified form rather than only separately, even if the total length necessarily becomes quite considerable.\\n\\nWorld War II dominates our twentieth century landscape like a colossus, and still casts huge shadows across our modern world. That global conflict has probably been the subject of far more sustained coverage, whether in print or electronic media, than any other event in human history. So if we encounter a small handful of highly anomalous items that seem to directly contradict such an ocean of enormously detailed and long-accepted information, there is a natural tendency to dismiss these few outliers as implausible or even delusional.\\n\\nBut once the total number of such discordant seemingly yet well-documented elements becomes sufficiently large, we must take them more seriously, and perhaps eventually concede that most of them are probably correct. As was suggested in a quote widely if doubtfully attributed to Stalin, \\u201cQuantity has a quality all of its own.\\u201d\\n\\nI am hardly the first individual to gradually become aware of this sweeping and cohesive counter-narrative of the Second World War, and a few months ago I happened to read Germany\\u2019s War, published in 2014 by amateur historian John Wear.\\n\\nDrawing from sources that substantially overlap with the ones I have discussed, his conclusions are reasonably similar to my own, but presented in a book length form that includes some 1,200 exact source references. So those interested in a much more detailed exposition of these same issues can read it and decide for themselves.\\n\\nWhen intellectual freedom is under attack, challenging an officially enshrined mythology may become legally perilous. I have seen claims that thousands of individuals who hold heterodox opinions about various aspects of the history of World War II are today imprisoned across Europe on the basis of those beliefs. If so, that total is probably far higher than the number of ideological dissidents who had suffered a similar fate in the decaying Soviet Bloc countries of the 1980s.\\n\\nWorld War II ended nearly three generations ago, and few of its adult survivors still walk the earth. From one perspective the true facts of that conflict and whether or not they actually contradict our traditional beliefs might appear rather irrelevant. Tearing down the statues of some long-dead historical figures and replacing them with the statues of others hardly seems of much practical value.\\n\\nBut if we gradually conclude that the story that all of us have been told during our entire lifetimes is substantially false and perhaps largely inverted, the implications for our understanding of the world are enormous. Most of the surprising material presented here is hardly hidden or kept under lock-and-key. Nearly all the books are easily available at Amazon or even freely readable on the Internet, many of the authors have received critical and scholarly acclaim, and in some cases their works have sold in the millions.\\n\\nYet this important material has been almost entirely ignored or dismissed by the popular media that shapes the common beliefs of our society. So we must necessarily begin to wonder what other massive falsehoods may have been similarly promoted by that media, perhaps involving incidents of the recent past or even the present day. And those latter events do have enormous practical significance. As I pointed out several years ago in my original American Pravda article:\\n\\nEven if the overwhelming majority of the unorthodox claims provided by such non-traditional web-based sources is incorrect, at least there now exists the possibility of extracting vital nuggets of truth from vast mountains of falsehood.\\n\\nWe must also recognize that many of the fundamental ideas that dominate our present-day world were founded upon a particular understanding of that wartime history, and if there seems good reason to believe that narrative is substantially false, perhaps we should begin questioning the framework of beliefs erected upon it.\\n\\nGeorge Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil War during the 1930s and discovered that the true facts in Spain were radically different from what he had been led to believe by the British media of his day. In 1948 these past experiences together with the rapidly congealing \\u201cofficial history\\u201d of the Second World War may have been uppermost in his mind when he published his classic novel 1984, which famously declared that \\u201cWho controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past.\\u201d\\n\\nIndeed, as I noted last year this observation has never been more true than when we consider some of the historical assumptions that govern the politics of today\\u2019s world, and the likelihood that they are entirely misleading:\\n\\nBack in those late Cold War days, the death toll of innocent civilians from the Bolshevik Revolution and the first two decades of the Soviet Regime was generally reckoned at running well into the tens of millions when we include the casualties of the Russian Civil War, the government-induced famines, the Gulag, and the executions. I\\u2019ve heard that these numbers have been substantially revised downwards to perhaps as little as twenty million or so, but no matter. Although determined Soviet apologists may dispute such very large figures, they have always been part of the standard narrative history taught within the West. Meanwhile, all historians know perfectly well that the Bolshevik leaders were overwhelmingly Jewish, with three of the five revolutionaries Lenin named as his plausible successors coming from that background. Although only around 4% of Russia\\u2019s population was Jewish, a few years ago Vladimir Putin stated that Jews constituted perhaps 80-85% of the early Soviet government, an estimate fully consistent with the contemporaneous claims of Winston Churchill, Times of London correspondent Robert Wilton, and the officers of American Military Intelligence. Recent books by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Yuri Slezkine, and others have all painted a very similar picture. And prior to World War II, Jews remained enormously over-represented in the Communist leadership, especially dominating the Gulag administration and the top ranks of the dreaded NKVD. Both of these simple facts have been widely accepted in America throughout my entire lifetime. But combine them together with the relatively tiny size of worldwide Jewry, around 16 million prior to World War II, and the inescapable conclusion is that in per capita terms Jews were the greatest mass-murderers of the twentieth century, holding that unfortunate distinction by an enormous margin and with no other nationality coming even remotely close. And yet, by the astonishing alchemy of Hollywood, the greatest killers of the last one hundred years have somehow been transmuted into being seen as the greatest victims, a transformation so seemingly implausible that future generations will surely be left gasping in awe. Today\\u2019s American Neocons are just as heavily Jewish as were the Bolsheviks of a hundred years ago, and they have greatly benefited from the political immunity provided by this totally bizarre inversion of historical reality. Partly as a consequence of their media-fabricated victimhood status, they have managed to seize control over much of our political system, especially our foreign policy, and have spent the last few years doing their utmost to foment an absolutely insane war with nuclear-armed Russia. If they do manage to achieve that unfortunate goal, they will surely outdo the very impressive human body-count racked up by their ethnic ancestors, perhaps even by an order-of-magnitude or more.\\n\\u2022 American Pravda: Our Great Purge of the 1940s http://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-our-great-purge-of-the-1940s/\", \"author\": \"Edward Morgan\", \"url\": \"https://prepareforchange.net/2020/01/23/the-ww2-war-crimes-of-churchill-and-the-americans-were-far-worse-than-hitlers/\", \"published\": \"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 19:05:04 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1579824304, \"collection_utc\": 1579824181}",News,1579824304

Revisionist historians who have actually dug up the buried evidence and examined it have made a case that whatever the Nazi crimes, they were rivaled, if not exceeded, by those of Churchill and the Americans.\\n\\nDresden before and after the fire bombing of this civilian city, devoid of any military value, except for terrorizing civilians\\n\\nUnz, a prolific reader with a knack for tying things together reviews some of the true history in what follows. To condition yourself for the coming shock, keep in mind that the same Hitler that is said to have hated Jews and systematically gassed and burnt them, had 150,000 half-and quarter-Jews serving in his armies, \\u201cmostly as combat officers, and these included at least 15 half-Jewish generals and admirals, with another dozen quarter Jews holding those same high ranks.\\n\\nThe most notable example was Field Marshal Erhard Milch, Hermann Goering\\u2019s powerful second-in-command, who played such an important operational role in creating the Luftwaffe. Milch certainly had a Jewish father, and according to some much less substantiated claims, perhaps even a Jewish mother as well, while his sister was married to an SS general.\\u201d\\n\\nWhen truth-tellers rattle our cages, we get upset over having our comfortable make-believe world disturbed and shout invectives. Rather than condemn the messanger, the more mature response would be to condemn those who lied to us and institutionalized false history into our consciousness. Keep in mind that the few who tell you the truth pay a high price for doing so; therefore, you should refrain from adding your invective to the copious amount heaped on them by the Establishment.\\n\\nThink about it. Which is your true friend, the one who tells you the truth, or the one who controls the explanations you receive in order to advance his own agenda?\\n\\nI again state my admiration of Ron Unz. He is Jewish. He is highly intelligent. He is a Harvard graduate. He is an entrepreneur who made himself a multi-millionaire. He could have held his fire and risen to the top of the establishment. Instead, he chose to tell us the truth. Ron Unz is the person who should be President. Unlike Trump, Unz would know how to staff a government that would put truth and morality back in charge of our future.\\n\\nHere is Ron Unz weighing for us the historical evidence on who was the worst war criminal. The emphasis is added:\\n\\nFor most present-day Americans, the primary image associated with Hitler and his German regime is the horrendous scale of the war-crimes that they supposedly committed during the global conflict that they are alleged to have unleashed. But in one of his lectures, Irving made the rather telling observation that the relative scale of such World War II crimes and especially their evidentiary base might not necessarily point in the direction of implicating the Germans.\\n\\nAlthough Hollywood and those in its thrall have endlessly cited the findings of the Nuremberg Tribunals as the final word on Nazi barbarism, even a cursory examination of those proceedings raises enormous skepticism.\\n\\nAs time passed, historians gradually acknowledged that some of the most shocking and lurid pieces of evidence used to secure worldwide condemnation of the defendants\\u2014the human lampshades and bars of soap, the shrunken heads\\u2014were entirely fraudulent.\\n\\nThe Soviets were determined to prosecute the Nazis for the Katyn Forest massacre of the captured Polish officer corps even though the Western Allies were convinced that Stalin had actually been responsible, a belief eventually confirmed by Gorbachev and the newly-opened Soviet archives. If the Germans had actually done so many horrible things, one wonders why the prosecution would have bothered including such fabricated and false charges.\\n\\nAnd over the decades, considerable evidence has accumulated that the Gas Chambers and the Jewish Holocaust\\u2014the central elements of today\\u2019s Nazi \\u201cBlack Legend\\u201d\\u2014were just as fictional as all those other items.\\n\\nThe Germans were notoriously meticulous record-keepers, embracing orderly bureaucracy like no other people, and nearly all their archives were captured at the end of the war. Under these circumstances, it seems rather odd that there are virtually no traces of the plans or directives associated with the monstrous crimes that their leadership supposedly ordered committed in such massively industrial fashion. Instead, the entirety of the evidence seems to consist of a tiny quantity of rather doubtful documentary material, the dubious interpretations of certain phrases, and various German confessions, often obtained under brutal torture.\\n\\nGiven his crucial wartime role in Military Intelligence, John Beaty [The Iron Curtain Over America] was particularly harsh in his denunciation of the proceedings, and the numerous top American generals who endorsed his book add considerably to the weight of his verdict:\\n\\nBy contrast, Irving notes that if the Allies had instead been in the dock at Nuremberg, the evidence of their guilt would have been absolutely overwhelming. After all, it was Churchill who began the illegal terror-bombing of cities, a strategy deliberately intended to provoke German retaliation and which eventually led to the death of a million or more European civilians.\\n\\nLate in the war, military reversals had even persuaded the British leader to order similarly illegal poison gas attacks against German cities, along with the initiation of even more horrific biological warfare involving anthrax bombs. Irving located these signed directives in the British archives, although Churchill was later persuaded to countermand them before they were carried out. By contrast, German archival material demonstrates that Hitler had repeatedly ruled out any first use of such illegal weapons under any circumstances, even though Germany\\u2019s far deadlier arsenal might have turned the tide of the war in its favor.\\n\\nAlthough long forgotten today, Freda Utley was a mid-century journalist of some prominence. Born an Englishwoman, she had married a Jewish Communist and moved to Soviet Russia, then fled to America after her husband fell in one of Stalin\\u2019s purges.\\n\\nAlthough hardly sympathetic to the defeated Nazis, she strongly shared Beaty\\u2019s view of the monstrous perversion of justice at Nuremberg and her first-hand account of the months spent in Occupied Germany is eye-opening in its description of the horrific suffering imposed upon the prostrate population even years after the end of the war. Moreover:\\n\\nThe population movement certainly seems to have represented the largest ethnic-cleansing in the history of the world, and if the Germany had ever done anything even remotely similar during its years of European victories and conquests, the visually-gripping scenes of such an enormous flood of desperate, trudging refugees would surely have become a centerpiece of numerous World War II movies of the last seventy years. But since nothing like that ever happened, Hollywood screenwriters lost a tremendous opportunity.\\n\\nI think perhaps the most plausible explanation for the widespread promotion of a multitude of largely fictional German war-crimes at Nuremberg was to the camouflage and obscure the very real ones actually committed by the Allies.\\n\\nOther related indicators may be found in the extreme tone of some of the American publications of the period, even those produced well before our country even entered the war. For example:\\n\\nSurely any such similar book published in Hitler\\u2019s Germany that advocated the extermination of all Jews or Slavs would have been a centerpiece at Nuremberg, and any newspaper reviewers who had treated it favorably would probably have stood in the dock for \\u201ccrimes against humanity.\\u201d\\n\\nMeanwhile, the terrible nature of the Pacific War fought in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor is suggested by a 1944 issue of Life magazine that carried the photo of a young American woman with the skull of a Japanese soldier her boyfriend had sent her as a war souvenir. If any Nazi magazines ever featured similar images, I doubt the Allies would have had any need to fabricate ridiculous stories of human lampshades or soap.\\n\\nAnd remarkably enough, that grotesque scene actually provides a reasonably accurate indication of the savage atrocities that were regularly committed during the brutal fighting of the Pacific Theater. These unpleasant facts were fully set forth in War Without Mercy, an award-winning 1986 volume by eminent American historian John W. Dower that received glowing accolades by leading scholars and public intellectuals.\\n\\nThe unfortunate truth is that Americans typically massacred Japanese who sought to surrender or who had even already been taken as prisoners, with the result that only a small slice\\u2014during some years merely a tiny sliver\\u2014of Japanese troops defeated in battle ever survived.\\n\\nThe traditional excuse publicly offered for the virtual absence of any Japanese POWs was that their Bushido code made surrender unthinkable, yet when the Soviets defeated Japanese armies in 1945, they had no difficulty capturing over a million prisoners. Indeed, since interrogating prisoners was important for intelligence purposes, late in the war U.S. commanders began offering rewards such as ice cream to their troops for bringing some surrendering Japanese in alive rather than killing them in the field.\\n\\nAmerican GIs also regularly committed remarkably savage atrocities. Dead or wounded Japanese frequently had their gold teeth knocked out and taken as war-booty, and their ears were often cut-off and kept as souvenirs, as was also sometimes the case with their skulls. Meanwhile, Dower notes the absence of any evidence suggesting similar behavior on the other side.\\n\\nThe American media generally portrayed the Japanese as vermin fit for eradication, and numerous public statements by high-ranking American military leaders explicitly claimed that the bulk of the entire Japanese population would probably need to be exterminated in order to bring the war to a successful conclusion. Comparing such thoroughly-documented facts with the rather tenuous accusations usually leveled against Nazi political or military leaders is quite revealing.\\n\\nDuring the late 1980s evidence of other deep wartime secrets suddenly came to light.\\n\\nWhile visiting France during 1986 in preparation for an unrelated book, a Canadian writer named James Bacque stumbled upon clues suggesting that one of the most terrible secrets of post-war Germany had long remained completely hidden, and he soon embarked upon extensive research into the subject, finally publishing Other Losses in 1989. Based upon very considerable evidence, including government records, personal interviews, and recorded eyewitness testimony, he argued that after the end of the war, the Americans had starved to death as many as a million German POWs, seemingly as a deliberate act of policy, a war crime that would surely rank among the greatest in history. For decades, Western propagandists had relentlessly barraged the Soviets with claims that they were keeping back a million or more \\u201cmissing\\u201d German POWs as slave-laborers in their Gulag, while the Soviets had endlessly denied these accusations. According to Bacque, the Soviets had been telling the truth all along, and the missing soldiers had been among the enormous numbers who had fled westward near the end of the war, seeking what they assumed would be far better treatment at the hands of the advancing Anglo-American armies. But instead, they were denied all normal legal protections, and confined under horrible conditions where they rapidly perished of hunger, illness, and exposure. Without attempting to summarize Bacque\\u2019s extensive accumulation of supporting material, a few of his factual elements are worth mentioning. At the close of hostilities, the American government employed circuitous legal reasoning to argue that the many millions of German troops that they had captured should not be considered \\u201cprisoners of war\\u201d and therefore were not covered by the provisions of the Geneva Convention. Soon afterward, attempts by the International Red Cross to provide food shipments to the enormous Allied prison camps were repeatedly rejected, and notices were posted throughout the nearby German towns and villages that any civilian who attempted to smuggle food to the desperate POWs might be shot on sight. These undeniable historical facts do seem to suggest certain dark possibilities. Although initially released by an obscure publisher, Bacque\\u2019s book soon became a sensation and an international best-seller. He paints Gen. Dwight Eisenhower as the central culprit behind the tragedy, noting the far lower POW losses in areas outside his control, and suggests that as a highly ambitious \\u201cpolitical general\\u201d of German-American ancestry, he may have been under intense pressure to demonstrate his \\u201charshness\\u201d toward the defeated Wehrmacht foe. Furthermore, once the Cold War ended and the Soviet Archives were open to scholars, their contents seem to have strongly validated Bacque\\u2019s thesis. He notes that although the archives do contain explicit evidence of such long-denied atrocities as Stalin\\u2019s Katyn Forest massacre of Poland\\u2019s officer corps, they show absolutely no signs of any million missing German POWs, who instead had very likely ended their lives in the starvation and illness of Eisenhower\\u2019s death camps. Bacque points out that the German government has issued severe legal threats against anyone seeking to investigate the likely sites of the mass graves that might hold the remains of those long-dead POWs, and in an updated edition, he also mentions Germany\\u2019s enactment of harsh new laws meting out heavy prison sentences to anyone who merely questions the official narrative of World War II. Bacque\\u2019s discussion of the new evidence of the Kremlin archives constitutes a relatively small portion of his 1997 sequel, Crimes and Mercies, which centered around an even more explosive analysis, and also became an international best-seller. As described above, first-hand observers of post-war Germany in 1947 and 1948 such as Gollanz and Utley, had directly reported on the horrific conditions they discovered, and stated that for years official food rations for the entire population had been comparable to that of the inmates of Nazi concentration camps and sometimes far lower, leading to the widespread malnutrition and illness they witnessed all around them. They also noted the destruction of most of Germany\\u2019s pre-war housing stock and the severe overcrowding produced by the influx of so many millions of pitiful ethnic German refugees expelled from other parts of Central and Eastern Europe. But these visitors lacked any access to solid population statistics, and could only speculate upon the enormous human death toll that hunger and illness had already inflicted, and which would surely continue if policies were not quickly changed. Years of archival research by Bacque attempt to answer this question, and the conclusion he provides is certainly not a pleasant one. Both the Allied military government and the later German civilian authorities seem to have made a concerted effort to hide or obscure the true scale of the calamity visited upon German civilians during the years 1945-1950, and the official mortality statistics found in government reports are simply too fantastical to possibly be correct, although they became the basis for the subsequent histories of that period. Bacque notes that these figures suggest that the death rate during the terrible conditions of 1947, long remembered as the \\u201cHunger Year\\u201d (Hungerjahr) and vividly described in Gollancz\\u2019s account, was actually lower than that of the prosperous Germany of the late 1960s. Furthermore, private reports by American officials, mortality rates from individual localities, and other strong evidence demonstrate that these long-accepted aggregate numbers were essentially fictional. Instead, Bacque attempts to provide more realistic estimates based upon an examination of the population totals of the various German censuses together with the recorded influx of the huge number of German refugees. Based upon this simple analysis, he makes a reasonably strong case that the excess German deaths during that period amounted to at least around 10 million, and possibly many millions more. Furthermore, he provides substantial evidence that the starvation was either deliberate or at least enormously worsened by American government resistance to overseas food relief efforts. Perhaps these numbers should not be so totally surprising given that the official Morgenthau Plan had envisioned the elimination of around 20 million Germans, and as Bacque demonstrates, top American leaders quietly agreed to continue that policy in practice even while they renounced it in theory. Assuming these numbers are even remotely correct, the implications are quite remarkable. The toll of the human catastrophe experienced in post-war Germany would certainly rank among the greatest in modern peacetime history, far exceeding the deaths that occurred during the Ukrainian Famine of the early 1930s and possibly even approaching the wholly unintentional losses during Mao\\u2019s Great Leap Forward of 1959-61. Furthermore, the post-war German losses would vastly outrank either of these other unfortunate events in percentage terms and this would remain true even if the Bacque\\u2019s estimates are considerably reduced. Yet I doubt if even a small fraction of one percent of Americans are today aware of this enormous human calamity. Presumably memories are much stronger in Germany itself, but given the growing legal crackdown on discordant views in that unfortunate country, I suspect that anyone who discusses the topic too energetically risks immediate imprisonment. To a considerable extent, this historical ignorance has been heavily fostered by our governments, often using underhanded or even nefarious means. Just like in the old decaying USSR, much of the current political legitimacy of today\\u2019s American government and its various European vassal-states is founded upon a particular narrative history of World War II, and challenging that narrative might produce dire political consequences. Bacque credibly relates some of the apparent efforts to dissuade any major newspaper or magazine from running articles discussing the startling findings of his first book, thereby imposing a \\u201cblackout\\u201d aimed at absolutely minimizing any media coverage. Such measures seem to have been quite effective, since until eight or nine years ago, I\\u2019m not sure I had ever heard a word of these shocking ideas, and I have certainly never seen them seriously discussed in any of the numerous newspapers or magazines that I have carefully read over the last three decades. Even illegal means were employed to hinder the efforts of this solitary, determined scholar. At times, Bacque\\u2019s phone-lines were tapped, his mail intercepted, and his research materials surreptitiously copied, while his access to some official archives was blocked. Some of the elderly eyewitnesses who personally corroborated his analysis received threatening notes and had their property vandalized. In his Foreword to this 1997 book, De Zayas, the eminent international human rights attorney, praised Bacque\\u2019s ground-breaking research, and hoped that it would soon lead to a major scholarly debate aimed at reassessing the true facts of these historical events that had taken place a half-century earlier. But in his update to the 2007 edition, he expressed some outrage that no such discussion ever occurred, and instead the German government merely passed a series of harsh laws mandating prison sentences for anyone who substantially disputed the settled narrative of World War II and its immediate aftermath, perhaps by overly focusing on the suffering of German civilians. Although both of Bacque\\u2019s books became international best-sellers, the near-complete absence of any secondary media coverage ensured that they never entered public awareness with anything more than a pinprick. Another important factor is the tremendously disproportionate reach of print and electronic media. A best-seller may be read by many tens of thousands of people, but a successful film might reach tens of millions, and so long as Hollywood churns out endless movies denouncing Germany\\u2019s atrocities but not a single one on the other side, the true facts of that history are hardly likely to gain much traction. I strongly suspect that far more people today believe in the real-life existence of Batman and Spiderman than are even aware of the Bacque Hypothesis.\\n\\nMany of the elements presented above were drawn from my previous articles published over the last year or so, but I believe there is some value in providing this same material in unified form rather than only separately, even if the total length necessarily becomes quite considerable.\\n\\nWorld War II dominates our twentieth century landscape like a colossus, and still casts huge shadows across our modern world. That global conflict has probably been the subject of far more sustained coverage, whether in print or electronic media, than any other event in human history. So if we encounter a small handful of highly anomalous items that seem to directly contradict such an ocean of enormously detailed and long-accepted information, there is a natural tendency to dismiss these few outliers as implausible or even delusional.\\n\\nBut once the total number of such discordant seemingly yet well-documented elements becomes sufficiently large, we must take them more seriously, and perhaps eventually concede that most of them are probably correct. As was suggested in a quote widely if doubtfully attributed to Stalin, \\u201cQuantity has a quality all of its own.\\u201d\\n\\nI am hardly the first individual to gradually become aware of this sweeping and cohesive counter-narrative of the Second World War, and a few months ago I happened to read Germany\\u2019s War, published in 2014 by amateur historian John Wear.\\n\\nDrawing from sources that substantially overlap with the ones I have discussed, his conclusions are reasonably similar to my own, but presented in a book length form that includes some 1,200 exact source references. So those interested in a much more detailed exposition of these same issues can read it and decide for themselves.\\n\\nWhen intellectual freedom is under attack, challenging an officially enshrined mythology may become legally perilous. I have seen claims that thousands of individuals who hold heterodox opinions about various aspects of the history of World War II are today imprisoned across Europe on the basis of those beliefs. If so, that total is probably far higher than the number of ideological dissidents who had suffered a similar fate in the decaying Soviet Bloc countries of the 1980s.\\n\\nWorld War II ended nearly three generations ago, and few of its adult survivors still walk the earth. From one perspective the true facts of that conflict and whether or not they actually contradict our traditional beliefs might appear rather irrelevant. Tearing down the statues of some long-dead historical figures and replacing them with the statues of others hardly seems of much practical value.\\n\\nBut if we gradually conclude that the story that all of us have been told during our entire lifetimes is substantially false and perhaps largely inverted, the implications for our understanding of the world are enormous. Most of the surprising material presented here is hardly hidden or kept under lock-and-key. Nearly all the books are easily available at Amazon or even freely readable on the Internet, many of the authors have received critical and scholarly acclaim, and in some cases their works have sold in the millions.\\n\\nYet this important material has been almost entirely ignored or dismissed by the popular media that shapes the common beliefs of our society. So we must necessarily begin to wonder what other massive falsehoods may have been similarly promoted by that media, perhaps involving incidents of the recent past or even the present day. And those latter events do have enormous practical significance. As I pointed out several years ago in my original American Pravda article:\\n\\nEven if the overwhelming majority of the unorthodox claims provided by such non-traditional web-based sources is incorrect, at least there now exists the possibility of extracting vital nuggets of truth from vast mountains of falsehood.\\n\\nWe must also recognize that many of the fundamental ideas that dominate our present-day world were founded upon a particular understanding of that wartime history, and if there seems good reason to believe that narrative is substantially false, perhaps we should begin questioning the framework of beliefs erected upon it.\\n\\nGeorge Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil War during the 1930s and discovered that the true facts in Spain were radically different from what he had been led to believe by the British media of his day. In 1948 these past experiences together with the rapidly congealing \\u201cofficial history\\u201d of the Second World War may have been uppermost in his mind when he published his classic novel 1984, which famously declared that \\u201cWho controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past.\\u201d\\n\\nIndeed, as I noted last year this observation has never been more true than when we consider some of the historical assumptions that govern the politics of today\\u2019s world, and the likelihood that they are entirely misleading:\\n\\nBack in those late Cold War days, the death toll of innocent civilians from the Bolshevik Revolution and the first two decades of the Soviet Regime was generally reckoned at running well into the tens of millions when we include the casualties of the Russian Civil War, the government-induced famines, the Gulag, and the executions. I\\u2019ve heard that these numbers have been substantially revised downwards to perhaps as little as twenty million or so, but no matter. Although determined Soviet apologists may dispute such very large figures, they have always been part of the standard narrative history taught within the West. Meanwhile, all historians know perfectly well that the Bolshevik leaders were overwhelmingly Jewish, with three of the five revolutionaries Lenin named as his plausible successors coming from that background. Although only around 4% of Russia\\u2019s population was Jewish, a few years ago Vladimir Putin stated that Jews constituted perhaps 80-85% of the early Soviet government, an estimate fully consistent with the contemporaneous claims of Winston Churchill, Times of London correspondent Robert Wilton, and the officers of American Military Intelligence. Recent books by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Yuri Slezkine, and others have all painted a very similar picture. And prior to World War II, Jews remained enormously over-represented in the Communist leadership, especially dominating the Gulag administration and the top ranks of the dreaded NKVD. Both of these simple facts have been widely accepted in America throughout my entire lifetime. But combine them together with the relatively tiny size of worldwide Jewry, around 16 million prior to World War II, and the inescapable conclusion is that in per capita terms Jews were the greatest mass-murderers of the twentieth century, holding that unfortunate distinction by an enormous margin and with no other nationality coming even remotely close. And yet, by the astonishing alchemy of Hollywood, the greatest killers of the last one hundred years have somehow been transmuted into being seen as the greatest victims, a transformation so seemingly implausible that future generations will surely be left gasping in awe. Today\\u2019s American Neocons are just as heavily Jewish as were the Bolsheviks of a hundred years ago, and they have greatly benefited from the political immunity provided by this totally bizarre inversion of historical reality. Partly as a consequence of their media-fabricated victimhood status, they have managed to seize control over much of our political system, especially our foreign policy, and have spent the last few years doing their utmost to foment an absolutely insane war with nuclear-armed Russia. If they do manage to achieve that unfortunate goal, they will surely outdo the very impressive human body-count racked up by their ethnic ancestors, perhaps even by an order-of-magnitude or more.\\n\\u2022 American Pravda: Our Great Purge of the 1940s http://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-our-great-purge-of-the-1940s/\", \"author\": \"Edward Morgan\", \"url\": \"https://prepareforchange.net/2020/01/23/the-ww2-war-crimes-of-churchill-and-the-americans-were-far-worse-than-hitlers/\", \"published\": \"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 19:05:04 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1579824304, \"collection_utc\": 1579824181}",News,1579824304

AP's earlier story is below:\\n\\nChinese authorities Thursday moved to lock down at least three cities with a combined population of more than 18 million in an unprecedented effort to contain the deadly new virus that has sickened hundreds of people and spread to other parts of the world during the busy Lunar New Year travel period.\\n\\nThe open-ended lockdowns are unmatched in size, embracing more people than New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago put together.\\n\\nThe train station and airport in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, were shut down, and ferry, subway and bus service was halted. Normally bustling streets, shopping malls, restaurants and other public spaces in the city of 11 million were eerily quiet. Police checked all incoming vehicles but did not close off the roads.\\n\\nAuthorities announced similar measures would take effect Friday in the nearby cities of Huanggang and Ezhou. In Huanggang, theaters, internet cafes and other entertainment centers were also ordered closed.\\n\\nIn the capital, Beijing, officials canceled major events indefinitely, including traditional temple fairs that are a staple of holiday celebrations, to help control the spread of the virus. The Forbidden City, the palace complex in Beijing that is now a museum, announced it will close indefinitely on Saturday.\\n\\nAt least 17 people have died in the outbreak, all of them in and around Wuhan. Close to 600 have been infected, the vast majority of them in Wuhan, and many countries have begun screening travelers from China for symptoms of the virus, which can cause fever, coughing, trouble breathing and pneumonia.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organization decided against declaring the outbreak a global emergency for now. Such a declaration can bring more money and other resources to fight a threat but can also trigger economically damaging restrictions on trade and travel in the affected countries, making the decision a politically fraught one.\\n\\nThe decision \\u201cshould not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is serious or that we\\u2019re not taking it seriously. Nothing could be further from the truth,\\u201d WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. \\u201cWHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day.\\u201d\\n\\nChinese officials have not said how long the shutdowns will last. While sweeping measures are typical of China's communist government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world, even in deadly epidemics, because of concerns about infringing on people's liberties. And the effectiveness of such measures is unclear.\\n\\n\\u201cTo my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people is new to science,\\\" said Gauden Galea, the WHO''s representative in China. \\u201cIt has not been tried before as a public health measure. We cannot at this stage say it will or it will not work.\\\"\\n\\nJonathan Ball, a professor of virology at molecular virology at the University of Nottingham in Britain, said the lockdowns appear to be justified scientifically.\\n\\n\\u201cUntil there's a better understanding of what the situation is, I think it's not an unreasonable thing to do,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnything that limits people's travels during an outbreak would obviously work.\\u201d\\n\\nBut Ball cautioned that any such quarantine should be strictly time-limited. He added: \\u201cYou have to make sure you communicate effectively about why this is being done. Otherwise you will lose the goodwill of the people.\\u201d\\n\\nDuring the devastating West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014, Sierra Leone imposed a national three-day quarantine as health workers went door to door, searching for hidden cases. Burial teams collecting corpses and people taking the sick to Ebola centers were the only ones allowed to move freely. Frustrated residents complained of food shortages.\\n\\nIn China, the illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus first appeared last month in Wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub in central China's Hubei province. Other cases have been turned up in the United States, Japan, South Korea and Thailand. Singapore, Vietnam and Hong Kong reported their first cases Thursday.\\n\\nMost of the illnesses outside China involve people who were from Wuhan or had recently traveled there.\\n\\nImages from Wuhan showed long lines and empty shelves at supermarkets, as people stocked up for what could be weeks of isolation. That appeared to be an over-reaction, since no restrictions were placed on trucks carrying supplies into the city, although many Chinese have strong memories of shortages in the years before the country's recent economic boom.\\n\\nLocal authorities in Wuhan demanded all residents wear masks in public places. Police, SWAT teams and paramilitary troops guarded Wuhan's train station.\\n\\nLiu Haihan left Wuhan last Friday after visiting her boyfriend there. She said everything was normal then, before person-to-person transmission of the virus was confirmed. But things had changed rapidly.\\n\\nHer boyfriend \\\"didn't sleep much yesterday. He disinfected his house and stocked up on instant noodles,\\\" Liu said. \\u201cHe's not really going out. If he does, he wears a mask.\\\"\\n\\nThe sharp rise in illnesses comes as millions of Chinese travel for the Lunar New Year, one of the world's largest annual migrations of people.
