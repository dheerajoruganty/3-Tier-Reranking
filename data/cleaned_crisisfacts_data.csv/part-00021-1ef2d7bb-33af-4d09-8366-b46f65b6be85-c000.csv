The USSR\\u2019s tried to answer through raw weight, both in terms of size and number of boats.\\n\\nHistory\\u2019s three great submarine campaigns include the First Battle of the Atlantic, the Second Battle of the Atlantic, and the US Navy\\u2019s (USN) war against Japanese commerce in World War II. The contestants fought these campaigns through asymmetrical means, with submarines doing battle against aircraft and surface escorts.\\n\\nBut the greatest true submarine campaign never (or only intermittently) went \\u201chot.\\u201d Waged with advanced, streamlined submarines, hunting each other from the polar ice cap to the Eastern seaboard, the Cold War undersea \\u201cgame\\u201d lasted for over three decades. In case of real war, these submarines would safeguard (or destroy) NATO\\u2019s trans-Atlantic lifeline, and would protect (or sink) much of the nuclear deterrent of America, Russia, Britain, and France.\\n\\nSo what were the best submarines of the Cold War era? For the purposes of this list, we\\u2019re excluding ballistic missiles submarines or boomers, which have an entirely different mission from attack boats, built for different requirements. Instead, this list will focus on submarines optimized for killing surface ships or other submarines. The criteria should be familiar from previous lists; to what extent did the vessels perform its strategic mission at a price that its nation could afford?\\n\\nCost: Submarines compete with other providers of national security. If they break the bank, they risk crowding out the other capabilities that a nation requires for its defense.\\n\\nReliability: When submarines have accidents, the results can be catastrophic. And showing up is half the battle; boats stuck in port can\\u2019t fulfill national objectives.\\n\\nEffectiveness: Could the submarine do the job? How did it stack up against its contemporaries?\\n\\nLarge, fast, and quiet, the Permit class set that standard for American and British submarines for the rest of the Cold War. Developed with a series of innovations that set them apart from their predecessors, the Skipjack class, the Permits immediately became state of the undersea art. These innovations included powerful bow sonar, a streamlined, deep-dive capable hull, and advanced quieting technology. Among the first submarines conceived an optimized for an anti-submarine mission, the Permits could threaten not only the Soviet deterrent, but also the Russian capacity for disrupting the trans-Atlantic lifeline.\\n\\nThe first of fourteen Permits entered service in 1961, the last in 1968. Most of the boats served through the end of the Cold War. Displacing 4200 tons, the Permits could make 28 knots, and could fire both advanced torpedoes and Harpoon anti-ship missiles.\\n\\nThe lead ship of the Permit class was Thresher, commissioned in 1961. On April 10, 1963, she was lost with all hands while conducting a diving test. The tragic loss of Thresher, which imploded after a still-disputed systems failure, overshadowed the long careers of the rest of the class. However, that loss was critical to developing the safety standards that would prevent future accidents. The loss of Thresher, in a very important sense, led to the long history of safety success in the USN\\u2019s submarine fleet.\\n\\nThe United States and the Soviet Union were the main players in the Cold War submarine campaign, but were hardly the only entrants. The Royal Navy, initially with some US assistance, developed a series of lethal nuclear submarine designs, eventually making a more than creditable contribution to NATO\\u2019s undersea posture. One submarine, HMS Conqueror, remains the only nuclear submarine to have destroyed an enemy ship in anger.\\n\\nFollowing up on the Churchill class, the Swiftsures were of innovative design, both in terms of hull technology and propulsion. They were the first full class of submarines to employ pump jet technology, which made propulsion more efficient while reducing noise. The enlarged but simplified hull redistributed machinery allowed a much deeper diving depth than previous Royal Navy subs.\\n\\nDisplacing 5000 tons submerged, the Swiftsures could make some 30 knots submerged. They carried standard torpedoes, as well as Harpoon and (in some boats) Tomahawk cruise missiles. The six Swiftsures entered service between 1973 and 1981, with the last decommissioning in 2010.\\n\\nThe Swiftsures had their problems, including a series of bizarre accidental collisions, some structural failures, and some minor reactor troubles. Nevertheless, they served the Royal Navy very effectively against the Soviets, and would have won victories in the Falklands if the politics had played out differently.\\n\\nNot every navy can afford an advanced nuclear attack submarine. Nevertheless, submarines solve strategic problems, and not every great submarine needs to be a Porsche. The German Type 209, first built in 1971, served as the strategic answer for a great many navies in the Cold War, and continues to serve today.\\n\\nFor obvious reasons, German submarine development stalled at the end of World War II. Although the Type XXI set the standard for post-war boats, legal restrictions prevented both East and West Germany from building any submarines in the first decade of the Cold War. After a series of designs that ran from non-to-moderately successful, HDW developed the Type 209 class for export.\\n\\nA diesel-electric, the Type 209 displaces between 1200 and 1800 tons (depending on variant), and can make 23 knots submerged. It can launch both torpedoes and anti-ship weapons, such as the Harpoon. The basic hull design has proven remarkably flexible, spawning a series of variants specialized for different tasks. The Type 209 gives small navies a viable anti-submarine option, as well as the capacity to threaten the surface forces of much larger, more powerful fleets.\\n\\nSince 1971, 61 Type 209s have entered service with thirteen navies. 59 of those boats remain in service, with two more scheduled for delivery to Egypt in 2016. The ability of the Type 209 to remain in service in so many different fleets, often in widely varying maintenance conditions, attests to the robust nature of the initial design.\\n\\nThe Oscars were the apogee of the Soviet cruise missile submarine, a type that began with the Echo and continued with the Charlie. The first Oscars entered service in 1981,and immediately presented a serious challenge for Western naval planners. Designed specifically for anti-shipping attacks, these subs could strike NATO carrier groups with P-700 Granit missiles from a range of up to 300 miles. This widened the area that American anti-submarine vessels needed to patrol, and meant that attacks could come from unexpected vectors. Equipped with a conventional warhead, the Granit could easily cause a mission kill. With a nuclear warhead, it could give a carrier battle group a very bad day.\\n\\nAnd the Oscars were huge. Displacing 16500 tons, they could make 32 knots submerged. They carried 24 Granit missiles, in addition to a bevy of torpedo launched weapons.\\n\\nThe United States and the United Kingdom would eventually adopt the same practice as the Russians, although instead of dedicating specific sub types to cruise missile launches they would focus on converting missiles for launch from conventionally designed nuclear attack subs. Later boats in the Los Angeles class would carry dedicated cruise missile silos, technically making them SSGNs instead of SSNs, although the designation never changed in practice (until the conversion of four Ohio class boomers to the cruise missile mission). The real utility of cruise missiles has been land attack rather than naval attack, as cruise missiles launched from US subs have proven quite effective in several recent conflicts.\\n\\nThe Soviets completed only five Oscars before the end of the Cold War, and another eight after. One, the Kursk, was lost in one of the most horrific accidents in submarine history. Several others, however, remain in service with the Russian Navy.\\n\\nThe United States enjoyed technology and designs advantages for most of the Cold War that allowed its submarines to operate much more quietly than their Soviet counterparts. US technological innovation and industrial practice made it possible for the USN to develop and maintain submarines with advanced noise-suppression technology. The USSR\\u2019s tried to answer through raw weight, both in terms of size and number of boats.\\n\\nSoviet espionage also tried to even the score. The fruits of the Walker spy ring and the Toshiba-Konigsberg scandal spread across several classes of Soviet submarine, but the Akulas benefitted most of all. The Akula\\u2019s were the first Soviet submarines to compete with American submarines on noise, reportedly matching the Los Angeles class at most speeds. Displacing 8000 tons, the Akulas could both outrun and outgun the American Los Angeles class, making up to 35 knots and carrying a larger array of torpedoes and cruise missiles.\\n\\nSteel hulled (unlike their Sierra and Alfa predecessors), the Akulas also achieved cost-savings while improving mission capability, a rare feat for a modern weapon system. Five Akulas entered service before the Cold War ended, with a total of fifteen eventually entering service. Nine remain in Russian service, with another on loan to the Indian Navy.\", \"author\": \"Robert Farley\", \"url\": \"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/death-deep-five-best-cold-war-submarines-116941\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 00:00 EST\", \"published_utc\": 1580014800, \"collection_utc\": 1580042634}",News,1580014800

That was the idea\\u2014it wasn\\u2019t an accident,\\u201d he added.\\n\\ntake our poll - story continues below\\n\\nHundt believes that the backlash against tech giants like Facebook is justified considering the circumstances.\\n\\n\\u201cMy conclusion is that Mark Zuckerberg, god bless him, who is a smart but really lucky guy, should not be surprised that people want to break up his company, because it\\u2019s exactly the same thing that happened to AT&T and also Standard Oil,\\u201d Hundt explained.\\n\\n\\u201cStandard Oil was also embedded in society in every conceivable way: in shipping, transportation, industrial process, heating. When companies are that deeply entrenched, it isn\\u2019t anymore just about efficiency and markets\\u2014it is about their political power, social power, and influence power,\\u201d he added.\\n\\nThe tech giants have largely wielded their monopoly power in a way to destroy freedom of expression for conservative dissidents and protect legacy media outlets that are sinking fast. Section 230 has allowed these Silicon Valley monoliths to act as partisan publishers without being punitively responsible for the content on their platforms.\\n\\nSection 230 reads as follows: \\u201cNo provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\\u201d\\n\\nHundt now admits the mistake that he and other regulators made when they were responsible for crafting the law in the 1990s.\\n\\n\\u201cWe were na\\u00efve. We were na\\u00efve in a way that is even hard to recapture. We all thought\\u2014Al Gore, me\\u2014that for people to be able to publish what they want would so enhance democracy and so inspire humanity, that it would lead to kind of flowering of creativity and emergence of a kind of a collective discovery of truth,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nHundt claimed that if he were in charge today, he \\u201cwould probably modify\\u201d Section 230 because it has \\u201cimmunized [tech platforms] from too much.\\u201d\\n\\nOne such reform that could reign in Section 230 is legislation proposed by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) to force digital platforms to be neutral in how they prepare their algorithms and moderate their content.\\n\\n\\u201cWith Section 230, tech companies get a sweetheart deal that no other industry enjoys: complete exemption from traditional publisher liability in exchange for providing a forum free of political censorship,\\u201d Hawley said in a statement. \\u201cUnfortunately, and unsurprisingly, big tech has failed to hold up its end of the bargain.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s a growing list of evidence that shows big tech companies making editorial decisions to censor viewpoints they disagree with,\\u201d Hawley added. \\u201cEven worse, the entire process is shrouded in secrecy because these companies refuse to make their protocols public. This legislation simply states that if the tech giants want to keep their government-granted immunity, they must bring transparency and accountability to their editorial processes and prove that they don\\u2019t discriminate.\\u201d\\n\\nThe tech giants have become perhaps the most powerful entities in the history of mankind, and they will need to be cut down to size or the Orwellian Nightmare will become an inescapable eventuality.\", \"author\": \"Shane Trejo\", \"url\": \"https://bigleaguepolitics.com/fcc-chair-who-implemented-section-230-admits-creating-a-tech-monopoly-was-the-plan-all-along/\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 00:04:04 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580015044, \"collection_utc\": 1579999752}",News,1580015044

Instead they \\u201cconsciously uncoupled\\u201d, a phrase that\\u2019s since been cemented in the celebrity twaddle hall of fame.\\n\\nThere are even ways to get around situations as awkward as affairs if you\\u2019re famous.\\n\\nWhen it was revealed in January that Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, had been having an affair for months and was now splitting with his wife, he announced that: \\u201cAfter a long period of loving exploration\\u2026 we have decided to divorce.\\u201d Yes, that\\u2019s what they\\u2019re calling cheating on your wife these days.\\n\\n\\u201cCelebrities, and in fact all of us, like to use euphemisms because they\\u2019re a safe or positive way to talk about difficult things,\\u201d says Anouchka Grose, a psychoanalyst and the author of No More Silly Love Songs: A Realist\\u2019s Guide To Romance.\\n\\n\\u201cThink of the euphemisms we all have for tricky subjects like death or sex, such as \\u2018kicking the bucket\\u2019 or \\u2018knocking boots\\u2019.\\n\\nThis type of language is also about reframing things we find scary to talk about by giving them a positive spin. Perhaps the word \\u2018single\\u2019 has associations of being lonely or isolated, whereas \\u2018self-partnered\\u2019 feels powerful and assertive and like it\\u2019s a conscious choice.\\u201d\\n\\nAnouchka says that, ultimately, these celebrity phrases are just ways to style something that\\u2019s hard to process, and maybe we can all learn from that.\\n\\n\\u201cAlthough it\\u2019s easy to mock phrases like \\u2018self-partnered\\u2019 or \\u2018consciously uncoupled\\u2019, which may seem pretentious, I think we would all like to aim for a break-up that is self-aware and respectful,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nBut she also admits that these phrases don\\u2019t always show the truth in a situation. \\u201cAt their worst these euphemisms can sterilise painful and hurtful situations and gloss over the truth of what happens when life doesn\\u2019t go to plan,\\u201d she adds.\\n\\nTaking cues from our favourite celebrities, perhaps this year we\\u2019ll also fall under the spell of celebrity jargon and start being economical with the truth.\\n\\nWhen we forget to buy a present we\\u2019ll be \\u201cgenerosity-challenged\\u201d and when we spend all day on Tinder we\\u2019ll be \\u201cembarking on a period of loving digital exploration\\u201d.\\n\\nNo doubt when we\\u2019re too hungover to help with the clearing up, we\\u2019ll be \\u201csuffering from extreme exhaustion\\u201d.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ll just ask our publicist (OK, maybe our little sister) to put out a statement asking that everyone please respect our privacy at this difficult time.\\n\\u2022 GOT a story?

One crucial aspect of the deal is an agreement by the United States to suspend additional tariffs set to take effect Dec. 15 and, crucially, reduce some of the tariffs already in place on some $360 billion in Chinese goods. And thanks to the deal, Washington and Beijing might finally have exited their tit-for-tat tariff escalations, although clouds remain on the horizon: After all, the scope of the phase one deal is narrow, and the two sides will struggle to agree to a more comprehensive deal \\u2014 portending perhaps even more disruptive battles in the tech supply chain in the year to come.\\n\\nAlthough officials did not provide text of the agreement that was authorized by U.S. President Donald Trump, Washington has reportedly agreed to cancel a new round of 15 percent tariffs on $160 billion worth of Chinese products \\u2014 mainly consumer goods. According to leaks of the deal's details, the United States will also cut existing tariffs of 25 percent on $250 billion in Chinese products to 12.5 percent and of 15 percent on another $112 billion in goods to 7.5 percent. In return, China has reportedly made an oral agreement to purchase $50 billion in U.S. agricultural products in 2020. Plus, China promised to broaden access to its financial sector and better protect U.S. intellectual property rights. The sides could sign an outline of the deal as early as Dec. 13.\\n\\nThe agreement stands to immediately limit the collateral damage to U.S. importers, who have borne significant costs from the tariffs, and U.S. consumers facing the prospect of much higher prices for consumer goods like mobile phones, laptops, toys and clothing. If finalized, the agreement also would aid the Chinese economy, which is growing at its slowest pace in nearly three decades, giving Beijing more breathing room to address some of its economy's structural risks.\\n\\nAnd there's good news for the global economy, too, as the deal could spur growth by as much as 0.5 percent in 2020. In terms of third countries, the trade deal would give a significant reprieve to key Asian exporters like Singapore, South Korea and Japan, which have experienced major supply chain disruptions and found themselves caught in the crossfire of tariff salvos. But the possible significant increase in U.S. farm purchases could also limit Chinese demand from other suppliers, especially for soybeans from Brazil and Argentina.\\n\\nWhat to Watch For\\n\\nBut now that Washington and Beijing have apparently struck their deal, there are two key points to watch. First, not all the details have been spelled out, meaning clashes over the final wording could yet erupt. The deal's scope regarding intellectual property rights, for instance, will depend on the exact language of the final agreement, and any differences over the farm purchase promise could raise further questions.\\n\\nSecond, there is little guarantee that the United States and China will take a similar view on implementing and interpreting the deal \\u2014 even on the sections that both have already signed off on. In past negotiations, they have differed on the sequencing, timing and details of other deals. Such differences of opinion will almost certainly occur with the phase one deal as well, especially on issues like the contract structures for China to buy U.S. goods, when those purchases will occur, and so forth. Further complicating the picture is a disagreement over human rights issues, which has loomed large over the talks. Given that, it is entirely possible that some of these issues could scuttle this limited deal before the sides manage to hammer out a more wide-ranging agreement.\\n\\nStill, if the limited deal endures, it could rescue the countries' trade talks from endless cycles of tariff escalation and de-escalation that have marred their dialogue in 2018 and 2019.

He would not confirm who had died until all the next of kin have been notified, he said. The L.A. County coroner\\u2019s office said Sunday night that the recovery effort is expected to take several days because of the condition of the crash site and its remote location. Officials have shut down roads leading to the site because of a throng of visitors trying to get there.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas. Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby. Responders included 56 fire personnel \\u2014 firefighters, a helicopter with paramedics, hand crews \\u2014 and sheriff\\u2019s deputies.\\n\\n\\u201cOur firefighters hiked into the accident site with their medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the stubborn fire as it included the brush fire \\u2026 and the helicopter,\\u201d Osby said during a news conference Sunday afternoon. \\u201cThe fire also included magnesium, which is very hard for firefighters to extinguish because magnesium reacts with oxygen and water.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. The FBI is also assisting in the probe, which is standard practice. The NTSB database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nThe fog was severe enough Sunday morning that the Los Angeles Police Department\\u2019s Air Support Division grounded its helicopters and didn\\u2019t fly until later in the afternoon, department spokesman Josh Rubenstein said.\\n\\n\\u201cThe weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,\\u201d Rubenstein said. The fog \\u201cwas enough that we were not flying.\\u201d LAPD\\u2019s flight minimums are 2 miles of visibility and an 800-foot cloud ceiling, he said.\\n\\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\\u2019s Department made a similar assessment about the fog and had no helicopters in the air Sunday morning \\u201cbasically because of the weather,\\u201d Villanueva said.\\n\\nKurt Deetz, a former pilot for Island Express Helicopters who used to fly Bryant in the chopper, said weather conditions were poor in Van Nuys on Sunday morning \\u2014 \\u201cnot good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nThe crash was more likely caused by bad weather than engine or mechanical issues, he said. \\u201cThe likelihood of a catastrophic twin engine failure on that aircraft \\u2014 it just doesn\\u2019t happen,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nJudging from a public record of the flight path and the wide debris field, Deetz said, it appears the helicopter was traveling very fast at the time of impact, about 160 mph. After a 40-minute flight, Deetz added, the craft would have had about 800 pounds of fuel on board. \\u201cThat\\u2019s enough to start a pretty big fire,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles County coroner\\u2019s office is working on retrieving the bodies and has not officially identified any of the victims. But Orange Coast College confirmed that baseball coach John Altobelli was among the others who died in the crash. As a mentor and coach for 27 years, he helped students earn scholarships to play at four-year colleges and treated players like family, the school said in a statement.\\n\\n\\u201cCoach Altobelli was a giant on our campus \\u2014 a beloved teacher, coach, colleague and friend. This is a tremendous loss for our campus community,\\u201d OCC President Angelica Suarez said in a statement.\\n\\nAltobelli\\u2019s wife, Keri Altobelli, and their 13-year-old daughter, Alyssa, who played on the club team with Bryant\\u2019s daughter, were also among the victims, according to his family.\\n\\nBryant was scheduled to coach Sunday in a game at his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks and was en route there when the helicopter crashed. The tournament, called the Mamba Cup, featured boys\\u2019 and girls\\u2019 travel teams of from fourth through eighth grade.\\n\\nScores of flowers, a Lakers banner and a photo of Bryant on the cover of Sports Illustrated were left at a growing memorial outside the locked front doors of the academy.\\n\\nChristina Mauser, Bryant\\u2019s top assistant coach on the travel basketball team, was also killed in the crash.\\n\\n\\u201cMy kids and I are devastated,\\u201d her husband, Matt Mauser, wrote on Facebook. \\u201cWe lost our beautiful wife and mom today in a helicopter crash.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Times is offering coverage of Kobe Bryant\\u2019s death for free today. Please consider a subscription to support our journalism.\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene both in and out of Staples Center on Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place around noon. As word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena, crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nFans gathered across the city to mourn. Outside Staples Center and at L.A. Live, a sea of purple orchids and yellow chrysanthemums formed. Among the crowd packed along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a pattern emerged: purple and yellow and white; 24 and 8 on people\\u2019s chests; \\u201cBRYANT\\u201d emblazoned across their backs.\\n\\nAt the intersection of Hollywood and Highland in Hollywood, a dance crew asked people in the crowd to yell out where they were visiting from \\u2014 Argentina, Korea, India. \\u201cI love you, Black Mamba!\\u201d one man shouted.\\n\\nThe ones who couldn\\u2019t get to L.A. landmarks mourned online. Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city\\u2019s heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport\\u2019s pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\nBy evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.\\n\\nL.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said people have flooded into the area of the crash, some going into residential neighborhoods and trying to get to the remote hillside where the helicopter went down. He said the traffic was making it harder for investigators and emergency personnel to do their jobs.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is off limits to everybody,\\u201d he said of the crash site, noting that the Federal Aviation Administration has a 5-mile no-fly zone around it up to altitudes of 5,000 feet. \\u201cPeople, stay away.\\u201d\\n\\nTimes staff writers Paul Pringle Gale Holland, Marisa Gerber, Nathan Fenno, David Carrillo, Michael DiGiovanna, Matthew Ormsth, Priscilla Vega, Chris Erskine, Alex Wigglesworth, Broderick Turner, Cindy Carcamo and Gustavo Arellano contributed to this report.\", \"author\": \"Richard Winton, Dan Woike, Sonali Kohli, Tania Ganguli, Ben Poston\", \"url\": \"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 03:02:42 -0500\", \"published_utc\": 1580025762, \"collection_utc\": 1580128394}",News,1580025762

He would not confirm who had died until all the next of kin have been notified, he said. The L.A. County coroner\\u2019s office said Sunday night that the recovery effort is expected to take several days because of the condition of the crash site and its remote location. Officials have shut down roads leading to the site because of a throng of visitors trying to get there.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas. Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby. Responders included 56 fire personnel \\u2014 firefighters, a helicopter with paramedics, hand crews \\u2014 and sheriff\\u2019s deputies.\\n\\n\\u201cOur firefighters hiked into the accident site with their medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the stubborn fire as it included the brush fire \\u2026 and the helicopter,\\u201d Osby said during a news conference Sunday afternoon. \\u201cThe fire also included magnesium, which is very hard for firefighters to extinguish because magnesium reacts with oxygen and water.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. The FBI is also assisting in the probe, which is standard practice. The NTSB database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nThe fog was severe enough Sunday morning that the Los Angeles Police Department\\u2019s Air Support Division grounded its helicopters and didn\\u2019t fly until later in the afternoon, department spokesman Josh Rubenstein said.\\n\\n\\u201cThe weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,\\u201d Rubenstein said. The fog \\u201cwas enough that we were not flying.\\u201d LAPD\\u2019s flight minimums are 2 miles of visibility and an 800-foot cloud ceiling, he said.\\n\\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\\u2019s Department made a similar assessment about the fog and had no helicopters in the air Sunday morning \\u201cbasically because of the weather,\\u201d Villanueva said.\\n\\nKurt Deetz, a former pilot for Island Express Helicopters who used to fly Bryant in the chopper, said weather conditions were poor in Van Nuys on Sunday morning \\u2014 \\u201cnot good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nThe crash was more likely caused by bad weather than engine or mechanical issues, he said. \\u201cThe likelihood of a catastrophic twin engine failure on that aircraft \\u2014 it just doesn\\u2019t happen,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nJudging from a public record of the flight path and the wide debris field, Deetz said, it appears the helicopter was traveling very fast at the time of impact, about 160 mph. After a 40-minute flight, Deetz added, the craft would have had about 800 pounds of fuel on board. \\u201cThat\\u2019s enough to start a pretty big fire,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles County coroner\\u2019s office is working on retrieving the bodies and has not officially identified any of the victims. But Orange Coast College confirmed that baseball coach John Altobelli was among the others who died in the crash. As a mentor and coach for 27 years, he helped students earn scholarships to play at four-year colleges and treated players like family, the school said in a statement.\\n\\n\\u201cCoach Altobelli was a giant on our campus \\u2014 a beloved teacher, coach, colleague and friend. This is a tremendous loss for our campus community,\\u201d OCC President Angelica Suarez said in a statement.\\n\\nAltobelli\\u2019s wife, Keri Altobelli, and their 13-year-old daughter, Alyssa, who played on the club team with Bryant\\u2019s daughter, were also among the victims, according to his family.\\n\\nBryant was scheduled to coach Sunday in a game at his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks and was en route there when the helicopter crashed. The tournament, called the Mamba Cup, featured boys\\u2019 and girls\\u2019 travel teams of from fourth through eighth grade.\\n\\nScores of flowers, a Lakers banner and a photo of Bryant on the cover of Sports Illustrated were left at a growing memorial outside the locked front doors of the academy.\\n\\nChristina Mauser, Bryant\\u2019s top assistant coach on the travel basketball team, was also killed in the crash.\\n\\n\\u201cMy kids and I are devastated,\\u201d her husband, Matt Mauser, wrote on Facebook. \\u201cWe lost our beautiful wife and mom today in a helicopter crash.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Times is offering coverage of Kobe Bryant\\u2019s death for free today.

But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene both in and out of Staples Center on Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place around noon. As word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena, crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother.

The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring.

He would not confirm who had died until all the next of kin have been notified, he said. The L.A. County coroner\\u2019s office said Sunday night that the recovery effort is expected to take several days because of the condition of the crash site and its remote location. Officials have shut down roads leading to the site because of a throng of visitors trying to get there.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas. Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby. Responders included 56 fire personnel \\u2014 firefighters, a helicopter with paramedics, hand crews \\u2014 and sheriff\\u2019s deputies.\\n\\n\\u201cOur firefighters hiked into the accident site with their medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the stubborn fire as it included the brush fire \\u2026 and the helicopter,\\u201d Osby said during a news conference Sunday afternoon. \\u201cThe fire also included magnesium, which is very hard for firefighters to extinguish because magnesium reacts with oxygen and water.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. The FBI is also assisting in the probe, which is standard practice. The NTSB database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nThe fog was severe enough Sunday morning that the Los Angeles Police Department\\u2019s Air Support Division grounded its helicopters and didn\\u2019t fly until later in the afternoon, department spokesman Josh Rubenstein said.\\n\\n\\u201cThe weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,\\u201d Rubenstein said. The fog \\u201cwas enough that we were not flying.\\u201d LAPD\\u2019s flight minimums are 2 miles of visibility and an 800-foot cloud ceiling, he said.\\n\\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\\u2019s Department made a similar assessment about the fog and had no helicopters in the air Sunday morning \\u201cbasically because of the weather,\\u201d Villanueva said.\\n\\nKurt Deetz, a former pilot for Island Express Helicopters who used to fly Bryant in the chopper, said weather conditions were poor in Van Nuys on Sunday morning \\u2014 \\u201cnot good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nThe crash was more likely caused by bad weather than engine or mechanical issues, he said. \\u201cThe likelihood of a catastrophic twin engine failure on that aircraft \\u2014 it just doesn\\u2019t happen,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nJudging from a public record of the flight path and the wide debris field, Deetz said, it appears the helicopter was traveling very fast at the time of impact, about 160 mph. After a 40-minute flight, Deetz added, the craft would have had about 800 pounds of fuel on board. \\u201cThat\\u2019s enough to start a pretty big fire,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles County coroner\\u2019s office is working on retrieving the bodies and has not officially identified any of the victims. But Orange Coast College confirmed that baseball coach John Altobelli was among the others who died in the crash. As a mentor and coach for 27 years, he helped students earn scholarships to play at four-year colleges and treated players like family, the school said in a statement.\\n\\n\\u201cCoach Altobelli was a giant on our campus \\u2014 a beloved teacher, coach, colleague and friend. This is a tremendous loss for our campus community,\\u201d OCC President Angelica Suarez said in a statement.\\n\\nAltobelli\\u2019s wife, Keri Altobelli, and their 13-year-old daughter, Alyssa, who played on the club team with Bryant\\u2019s daughter, were also among the victims, according to his family.\\n\\nBryant was scheduled to coach Sunday in a game at his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks and was en route there when the helicopter crashed. The tournament, called the Mamba Cup, featured boys\\u2019 and girls\\u2019 travel teams of from fourth through eighth grade.\\n\\nScores of flowers, a Lakers banner and a photo of Bryant on the cover of Sports Illustrated were left at a growing memorial outside the locked front doors of the academy.\\n\\nChristina Mauser, Bryant\\u2019s top assistant coach on the travel basketball team, was also killed in the crash.\\n\\n\\u201cMy kids and I are devastated,\\u201d her husband, Matt Mauser, wrote on Facebook. \\u201cWe lost our beautiful wife and mom today in a helicopter crash.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Times is offering coverage of Kobe Bryant\\u2019s death for free today. Please consider a subscription to support our journalism.\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene both in and out of Staples Center on Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place around noon. As word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena, crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nFans gathered across the city to mourn. Outside Staples Center and at L.A. Live, a sea of purple orchids and yellow chrysanthemums formed. Among the crowd packed along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a pattern emerged: purple and yellow and white; 24 and 8 on people\\u2019s chests; \\u201cBRYANT\\u201d emblazoned across their backs.\\n\\nAt the intersection of Hollywood and Highland in Hollywood, a dance crew asked people in the crowd to yell out where they were visiting from \\u2014 Argentina, Korea, India. \\u201cI love you, Black Mamba!\\u201d one man shouted.\\n\\nThe ones who couldn\\u2019t get to L.A. landmarks mourned online. Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city\\u2019s heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport\\u2019s pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative.

As word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena, crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nFans gathered across the city to mourn. Outside Staples Center and at L.A. Live, a sea of purple orchids and yellow chrysanthemums formed. Among the crowd packed along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a pattern emerged: purple and yellow and white; 24 and 8 on people\\u2019s chests; \\u201cBRYANT\\u201d emblazoned across their backs.\\n\\nAt the intersection of Hollywood and Highland in Hollywood, a dance crew asked people in the crowd to yell out where they were visiting from \\u2014 Argentina, Korea, India. \\u201cI love you, Black Mamba!\\u201d one man shouted.\\n\\nThe ones who couldn\\u2019t get to L.A. landmarks mourned online. Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city\\u2019s heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport\\u2019s pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\nBy evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.\\n\\nL.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said people have flooded into the area of the crash, some going into residential neighborhoods and trying to get to the remote hillside where the helicopter went down. He said the traffic was making it harder for investigators and emergency personnel to do their jobs.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is off limits to everybody,\\u201d he said of the crash site, noting that the Federal Aviation Administration has a 5-mile no-fly zone around it up to altitudes of 5,000 feet. \\u201cPeople, stay away.\\u201d\\n\\nTimes staff writers Paul Pringle Gale Holland, Marisa Gerber, Nathan Fenno, David Carrillo, Michael DiGiovanna, Matthew Ormsth, Priscilla Vega, Chris Erskine, Alex Wigglesworth, Broderick Turner, Cindy Carcamo and Gustavo Arellano contributed to this report.\", \"author\": \"Richard Winton, Dan Woike, Sonali Kohli, Tania Ganguli, Ben Poston\", \"url\": \"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 03:02:42 -0500\", \"published_utc\": 1580025762, \"collection_utc\": 1580128394}",News,1580025762

They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed.

IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\nBy evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.\\n\\nL.A.

He would not confirm who had died until all the next of kin have been notified, he said. The L.A. County coroner\\u2019s office said Sunday night that the recovery effort is expected to take several days because of the condition of the crash site and its remote location. Officials have shut down roads leading to the site because of a throng of visitors trying to get there.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas. Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby. Responders included 56 fire personnel \\u2014 firefighters, a helicopter with paramedics, hand crews \\u2014 and sheriff\\u2019s deputies.\\n\\n\\u201cOur firefighters hiked into the accident site with their medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the stubborn fire as it included the brush fire \\u2026 and the helicopter,\\u201d Osby said during a news conference Sunday afternoon. \\u201cThe fire also included magnesium, which is very hard for firefighters to extinguish because magnesium reacts with oxygen and water.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. The FBI is also assisting in the probe, which is standard practice. The NTSB database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nThe fog was severe enough Sunday morning that the Los Angeles Police Department\\u2019s Air Support Division grounded its helicopters and didn\\u2019t fly until later in the afternoon, department spokesman Josh Rubenstein said.\\n\\n\\u201cThe weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,\\u201d Rubenstein said. The fog \\u201cwas enough that we were not flying.\\u201d LAPD\\u2019s flight minimums are 2 miles of visibility and an 800-foot cloud ceiling, he said.\\n\\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\\u2019s Department made a similar assessment about the fog and had no helicopters in the air Sunday morning \\u201cbasically because of the weather,\\u201d Villanueva said.\\n\\nKurt Deetz, a former pilot for Island Express Helicopters who used to fly Bryant in the chopper, said weather conditions were poor in Van Nuys on Sunday morning \\u2014 \\u201cnot good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nThe crash was more likely caused by bad weather than engine or mechanical issues, he said. \\u201cThe likelihood of a catastrophic twin engine failure on that aircraft \\u2014 it just doesn\\u2019t happen,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nJudging from a public record of the flight path and the wide debris field, Deetz said, it appears the helicopter was traveling very fast at the time of impact, about 160 mph. After a 40-minute flight, Deetz added, the craft would have had about 800 pounds of fuel on board. \\u201cThat\\u2019s enough to start a pretty big fire,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles County coroner\\u2019s office is working on retrieving the bodies and has not officially identified any of the victims. But Orange Coast College confirmed that baseball coach John Altobelli was among the others who died in the crash. As a mentor and coach for 27 years, he helped students earn scholarships to play at four-year colleges and treated players like family, the school said in a statement.\\n\\n\\u201cCoach Altobelli was a giant on our campus \\u2014 a beloved teacher, coach, colleague and friend. This is a tremendous loss for our campus community,\\u201d OCC President Angelica Suarez said in a statement.\\n\\nAltobelli\\u2019s wife, Keri Altobelli, and their 13-year-old daughter, Alyssa, who played on the club team with Bryant\\u2019s daughter, were also among the victims, according to his family.\\n\\nBryant was scheduled to coach Sunday in a game at his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks and was en route there when the helicopter crashed. The tournament, called the Mamba Cup, featured boys\\u2019 and girls\\u2019 travel teams of from fourth through eighth grade.\\n\\nScores of flowers, a Lakers banner and a photo of Bryant on the cover of Sports Illustrated were left at a growing memorial outside the locked front doors of the academy.\\n\\nChristina Mauser, Bryant\\u2019s top assistant coach on the travel basketball team, was also killed in the crash.\\n\\n\\u201cMy kids and I are devastated,\\u201d her husband, Matt Mauser, wrote on Facebook. \\u201cWe lost our beautiful wife and mom today in a helicopter crash.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Times is offering coverage of Kobe Bryant\\u2019s death for free today.

But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene both in and out of Staples Center on Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place around noon. As word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena, crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nFans gathered across the city to mourn. Outside Staples Center and at L.A. Live, a sea of purple orchids and yellow chrysanthemums formed. Among the crowd packed along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a pattern emerged: purple and yellow and white; 24 and 8 on people\\u2019s chests; \\u201cBRYANT\\u201d emblazoned across their backs.\\n\\nAt the intersection of Hollywood and Highland in Hollywood, a dance crew asked people in the crowd to yell out where they were visiting from \\u2014 Argentina, Korea, India. \\u201cI love you, Black Mamba!\\u201d one man shouted.\\n\\nThe ones who couldn\\u2019t get to L.A. landmarks mourned online. Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city\\u2019s heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport\\u2019s pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia.

The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas.

I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene both in and out of Staples Center on Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place around noon. As word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena, crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nFans gathered across the city to mourn. Outside Staples Center and at L.A. Live, a sea of purple orchids and yellow chrysanthemums formed. Among the crowd packed along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a pattern emerged: purple and yellow and white; 24 and 8 on people\\u2019s chests; \\u201cBRYANT\\u201d emblazoned across their backs.\\n\\nAt the intersection of Hollywood and Highland in Hollywood, a dance crew asked people in the crowd to yell out where they were visiting from \\u2014 Argentina, Korea, India. \\u201cI love you, Black Mamba!\\u201d one man shouted.\\n\\nThe ones who couldn\\u2019t get to L.A. landmarks mourned online. Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city\\u2019s heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport\\u2019s pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\nBy evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.\\n\\nL.A.

His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\nBy evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.\\n\\nL.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said people have flooded into the area of the crash, some going into residential neighborhoods and trying to get to the remote hillside where the helicopter went down. He said the traffic was making it harder for investigators and emergency personnel to do their jobs.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is off limits to everybody,\\u201d he said of the crash site, noting that the Federal Aviation Administration has a 5-mile no-fly zone around it up to altitudes of 5,000 feet. \\u201cPeople, stay away.\\u201d\\n\\nTimes staff writers Paul Pringle Gale Holland, Marisa Gerber, Nathan Fenno, David Carrillo, Michael DiGiovanna, Matthew Ormsth, Priscilla Vega, Chris Erskine, Alex Wigglesworth, Broderick Turner, Cindy Carcamo and Gustavo Arellano contributed to this report.\", \"author\": \"Richard Winton, Dan Woike, Sonali Kohli, Tania Ganguli, Ben Poston\", \"url\": \"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 03:02:42 -0500\", \"published_utc\": 1580025762, \"collection_utc\": 1580128394}",News,1580025762

He would not confirm who had died until all the next of kin have been notified, he said. The L.A. County coroner\\u2019s office said Sunday night that the recovery effort is expected to take several days because of the condition of the crash site and its remote location. Officials have shut down roads leading to the site because of a throng of visitors trying to get there.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas. Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby. Responders included 56 fire personnel \\u2014 firefighters, a helicopter with paramedics, hand crews \\u2014 and sheriff\\u2019s deputies.\\n\\n\\u201cOur firefighters hiked into the accident site with their medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the stubborn fire as it included the brush fire \\u2026 and the helicopter,\\u201d Osby said during a news conference Sunday afternoon. \\u201cThe fire also included magnesium, which is very hard for firefighters to extinguish because magnesium reacts with oxygen and water.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. The FBI is also assisting in the probe, which is standard practice. The NTSB database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nThe fog was severe enough Sunday morning that the Los Angeles Police Department\\u2019s Air Support Division grounded its helicopters and didn\\u2019t fly until later in the afternoon, department spokesman Josh Rubenstein said.\\n\\n\\u201cThe weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,\\u201d Rubenstein said. The fog \\u201cwas enough that we were not flying.\\u201d LAPD\\u2019s flight minimums are 2 miles of visibility and an 800-foot cloud ceiling, he said.\\n\\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\\u2019s Department made a similar assessment about the fog and had no helicopters in the air Sunday morning \\u201cbasically because of the weather,\\u201d Villanueva said.\\n\\nKurt Deetz, a former pilot for Island Express Helicopters who used to fly Bryant in the chopper, said weather conditions were poor in Van Nuys on Sunday morning \\u2014 \\u201cnot good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nThe crash was more likely caused by bad weather than engine or mechanical issues, he said. \\u201cThe likelihood of a catastrophic twin engine failure on that aircraft \\u2014 it just doesn\\u2019t happen,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nJudging from a public record of the flight path and the wide debris field, Deetz said, it appears the helicopter was traveling very fast at the time of impact, about 160 mph. After a 40-minute flight, Deetz added, the craft would have had about 800 pounds of fuel on board. \\u201cThat\\u2019s enough to start a pretty big fire,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles County coroner\\u2019s office is working on retrieving the bodies and has not officially identified any of the victims. But Orange Coast College confirmed that baseball coach John Altobelli was among the others who died in the crash. As a mentor and coach for 27 years, he helped students earn scholarships to play at four-year colleges and treated players like family, the school said in a statement.\\n\\n\\u201cCoach Altobelli was a giant on our campus \\u2014 a beloved teacher, coach, colleague and friend. This is a tremendous loss for our campus community,\\u201d OCC President Angelica Suarez said in a statement.\\n\\nAltobelli\\u2019s wife, Keri Altobelli, and their 13-year-old daughter, Alyssa, who played on the club team with Bryant\\u2019s daughter, were also among the victims, according to his family.\\n\\nBryant was scheduled to coach Sunday in a game at his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks and was en route there when the helicopter crashed.

He would not confirm who had died until all the next of kin have been notified, he said. The L.A. County coroner\\u2019s office said Sunday night that the recovery effort is expected to take several days because of the condition of the crash site and its remote location. Officials have shut down roads leading to the site because of a throng of visitors trying to get there.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas. Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby. Responders included 56 fire personnel \\u2014 firefighters, a helicopter with paramedics, hand crews \\u2014 and sheriff\\u2019s deputies.\\n\\n\\u201cOur firefighters hiked into the accident site with their medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the stubborn fire as it included the brush fire \\u2026 and the helicopter,\\u201d Osby said during a news conference Sunday afternoon. \\u201cThe fire also included magnesium, which is very hard for firefighters to extinguish because magnesium reacts with oxygen and water.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. The FBI is also assisting in the probe, which is standard practice. The NTSB database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nThe fog was severe enough Sunday morning that the Los Angeles Police Department\\u2019s Air Support Division grounded its helicopters and didn\\u2019t fly until later in the afternoon, department spokesman Josh Rubenstein said.\\n\\n\\u201cThe weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,\\u201d Rubenstein said. The fog \\u201cwas enough that we were not flying.\\u201d LAPD\\u2019s flight minimums are 2 miles of visibility and an 800-foot cloud ceiling, he said.\\n\\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\\u2019s Department made a similar assessment about the fog and had no helicopters in the air Sunday morning \\u201cbasically because of the weather,\\u201d Villanueva said.\\n\\nKurt Deetz, a former pilot for Island Express Helicopters who used to fly Bryant in the chopper, said weather conditions were poor in Van Nuys on Sunday morning \\u2014 \\u201cnot good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nThe crash was more likely caused by bad weather than engine or mechanical issues, he said. \\u201cThe likelihood of a catastrophic twin engine failure on that aircraft \\u2014 it just doesn\\u2019t happen,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nJudging from a public record of the flight path and the wide debris field, Deetz said, it appears the helicopter was traveling very fast at the time of impact, about 160 mph. After a 40-minute flight, Deetz added, the craft would have had about 800 pounds of fuel on board. \\u201cThat\\u2019s enough to start a pretty big fire,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles County coroner\\u2019s office is working on retrieving the bodies and has not officially identified any of the victims. But Orange Coast College confirmed that baseball coach John Altobelli was among the others who died in the crash. As a mentor and coach for 27 years, he helped students earn scholarships to play at four-year colleges and treated players like family, the school said in a statement.\\n\\n\\u201cCoach Altobelli was a giant on our campus \\u2014 a beloved teacher, coach, colleague and friend. This is a tremendous loss for our campus community,\\u201d OCC President Angelica Suarez said in a statement.\\n\\nAltobelli\\u2019s wife, Keri Altobelli, and their 13-year-old daughter, Alyssa, who played on the club team with Bryant\\u2019s daughter, were also among the victims, according to his family.\\n\\nBryant was scheduled to coach Sunday in a game at his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks and was en route there when the helicopter crashed. The tournament, called the Mamba Cup, featured boys\\u2019 and girls\\u2019 travel teams of from fourth through eighth grade.\\n\\nScores of flowers, a Lakers banner and a photo of Bryant on the cover of Sports Illustrated were left at a growing memorial outside the locked front doors of the academy.\\n\\nChristina Mauser, Bryant\\u2019s top assistant coach on the travel basketball team, was also killed in the crash.\\n\\n\\u201cMy kids and I are devastated,\\u201d her husband, Matt Mauser, wrote on Facebook. \\u201cWe lost our beautiful wife and mom today in a helicopter crash.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Times is offering coverage of Kobe Bryant\\u2019s death for free today. Please consider a subscription to support our journalism.\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene both in and out of Staples Center on Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place around noon. As word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena, crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nFans gathered across the city to mourn. Outside Staples Center and at L.A. Live, a sea of purple orchids and yellow chrysanthemums formed. Among the crowd packed along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a pattern emerged: purple and yellow and white; 24 and 8 on people\\u2019s chests; \\u201cBRYANT\\u201d emblazoned across their backs.\\n\\nAt the intersection of Hollywood and Highland in Hollywood, a dance crew asked people in the crowd to yell out where they were visiting from \\u2014 Argentina, Korea, India. \\u201cI love you, Black Mamba!\\u201d one man shouted.\\n\\nThe ones who couldn\\u2019t get to L.A. landmarks mourned online. Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city\\u2019s heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport\\u2019s pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed.

But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene both in and out of Staples Center on Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place around noon. As word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena, crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nFans gathered across the city to mourn. Outside Staples Center and at L.A. Live, a sea of purple orchids and yellow chrysanthemums formed. Among the crowd packed along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a pattern emerged: purple and yellow and white; 24 and 8 on people\\u2019s chests; \\u201cBRYANT\\u201d emblazoned across their backs.\\n\\nAt the intersection of Hollywood and Highland in Hollywood, a dance crew asked people in the crowd to yell out where they were visiting from \\u2014 Argentina, Korea, India. \\u201cI love you, Black Mamba!\\u201d one man shouted.\\n\\nThe ones who couldn\\u2019t get to L.A. landmarks mourned online. Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city\\u2019s heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport\\u2019s pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\nBy evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.\\n\\nL.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said people have flooded into the area of the crash, some going into residential neighborhoods and trying to get to the remote hillside where the helicopter went down. He said the traffic was making it harder for investigators and emergency personnel to do their jobs.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is off limits to everybody,\\u201d he said of the crash site, noting that the Federal Aviation Administration has a 5-mile no-fly zone around it up to altitudes of 5,000 feet. \\u201cPeople, stay away.\\u201d\\n\\nTimes staff writers Paul Pringle Gale Holland, Marisa Gerber, Nathan Fenno, David Carrillo, Michael DiGiovanna, Matthew Ormsth, Priscilla Vega, Chris Erskine, Alex Wigglesworth, Broderick Turner, Cindy Carcamo and Gustavo Arellano contributed to this report.\", \"author\": \"Richard Winton, Dan Woike, Sonali Kohli, Tania Ganguli, Ben Poston\", \"url\": \"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 03:02:42 -0500\", \"published_utc\": 1580025762, \"collection_utc\": 1580128394}",News,1580025762

This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene both in and out of Staples Center on Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place around noon. As word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena, crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nFans gathered across the city to mourn. Outside Staples Center and at L.A. Live, a sea of purple orchids and yellow chrysanthemums formed. Among the crowd packed along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a pattern emerged: purple and yellow and white; 24 and 8 on people\\u2019s chests; \\u201cBRYANT\\u201d emblazoned across their backs.\\n\\nAt the intersection of Hollywood and Highland in Hollywood, a dance crew asked people in the crowd to yell out where they were visiting from \\u2014 Argentina, Korea, India. \\u201cI love you, Black Mamba!\\u201d one man shouted.\\n\\nThe ones who couldn\\u2019t get to L.A. landmarks mourned online. Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city\\u2019s heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport\\u2019s pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\nBy evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.\\n\\nL.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said people have flooded into the area of the crash, some going into residential neighborhoods and trying to get to the remote hillside where the helicopter went down. He said the traffic was making it harder for investigators and emergency personnel to do their jobs.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is off limits to everybody,\\u201d he said of the crash site, noting that the Federal Aviation Administration has a 5-mile no-fly zone around it up to altitudes of 5,000 feet. \\u201cPeople, stay away.\\u201d\\n\\nTimes staff writers Paul Pringle Gale Holland, Marisa Gerber, Nathan Fenno, David Carrillo, Michael DiGiovanna, Matthew Ormsth, Priscilla Vega, Chris Erskine, Alex Wigglesworth, Broderick Turner, Cindy Carcamo and Gustavo Arellano contributed to this report.\", \"author\": \"Richard Winton, Dan Woike, Sonali Kohli, Tania Ganguli, Ben Poston\", \"url\": \"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 03:02:42 -0500\", \"published_utc\": 1580025762, \"collection_utc\": 1580128394}",News,1580025762

Just as hundreds of millions of people should be reuniting with their families to celebrate the biggest holiday of the year, the lunar new year, swathes of the country have been put on lockdown and celebrations all but called off.\\n\\nAs Xia and her parents tucked into a special winter rice and egg porridge on 27 December, even city authorities may not have known that the virus had started spreading around the city.\\n\\nIt was not until three days later that they put out a public warning about a \\u201cpneumonia of unknown cause\\u201d which doctors had identified in Wuhan, and four days later that national authorities filed their first report about the outbreak with the World Health Organisation.\\n\\nIn early January, 36-year-old Xia started running a low fever. By then, authorities had closed the seafood market for disinfection, and identified 44 patients with the unknown pneumonia.\\n\\nBut when she went to a local hospital on 4 January for a check-up, no one asked Xia about possible links to the market, or mentioned the mystery new illness. Doctors told her to go home, rest and take over-the-counter medication.\\n\\nShe followed their advice but her condition continued to worsen. Her fever intensified, she started having respiratory problems, and eating or drinking became painful.\\n\\nHer illness was developing in tandem with knowledge about the mysterious new outbreak. On 9 January, China announced it had identified a new coronavirus, from the same family that caused the 2002 Sars outbreak, in one of the Wuhan patients. Like all viruses in the corona family, it had originated in an animal; scientists were already racing to uncover the source.\\n\\nThe next day, authorities announced the first death from the disease and released the genetic sequence of the new virus online for study, winning plaudits for an approach that seemed very different from the official cover-up that exacerbated the Sars crisis.\\n\\nThere were even hopes that Beijing might have managed to stop the outbreak before it had really begun. On 13 January, Chinese authorities said they had not identified any new cases for over a week; and although a first case was reported outside the country in a traveller to China, she had first developed symptoms days earlier.\\n\\nIf the disease came only from eating some kind of infected animal, and the market where it had originated was shut, there was perhaps a real possibility that no further cases would appear.\\n\\nBut it has now emerged that even though China freely shared details of the cases it had identified in the early days of January, doctors on the ground in the city where the disease began were not testing widely for the new virus as the month progressed.\\n\\nThere is growing concern that a failure to carry out comprehensive testing during the early days of the outbreak could have helped the virus spread.\\n\\nXia believes she is one of many victims who do not show up in statistics; she was finally admitted to hospital on the day after the genetic code was released. Despite her link to the market at the centre of the outbreak, and symptoms that matched those of confirmed victims, she was never tested.\\n\\n\\u201cBefore there were any testing kits, which was before 16 January, I was regarded as a highly suspected case, meaning that I showed almost all of the symptoms,\\u201d Xia told the Observer.\\n\\nBut the hospital was already struggling with a sharp increase in patients showing symptoms that matched the reported coronavirus ones. Xia estimates that there were only two doctors on staff to check hundreds of people seeking help.\\n\\nTerribly overstretched, they focused only on the most serious cases and so on 20 January doctors discharged Xia into the care of her parents, without even formally noting her link to the South China seafood market on medical notes.\\n\\nThat was the day China confirmed the disease could be spread between humans, rather than just picked up direct from an animal source.\\n\\nThe number of patients had tripled, cases had appeared in other major cities, including the capital Beijing, and in a sign of official concern, the country\\u2019s authoritarian president, Xi Jinping, made his first comments on the virus, saying it must be \\u201cresolutely contained\\u201d.\\n\\nYet Xia was sent home, still sick, without having been tested. She is being cared for by her parents, but is terrified she might infect them; they try to protect themselves by staying five metres away from her at all times.\\n\\nThree days later, China stunned its citizens and the world by putting Wuhan under quarantine. From the morning of 23 January, no trains, planes or public transport would be allowed to leave the city; roadblocks later stopped most private cars from leaving either.\\n\\nClosing off a major industrial and commercial hub, home to 11 million people, was the bluntest possible admission that Beijing was now extremely worried about the new disease. Further decisive action included a pledge to build a new 1,000-bed hospital dedicated to the disease in under a week, and a second within two weeks.\\n\\nWork has already started on the first, and given China\\u2019s track record of throwing up a similar hospital in Beijing during the Sars crisis, there is little doubt that the prefabricated facility will be finished in this extraordinary timescale.\\n\\nAnd in a sign that authorities had shifted from trying to downplay the disease, a very last-minute tribute to the doctors and nurses battling the disease was included in the new year television gala show, one of the most high-profile broadcasts of the year.\\n\\nBy the time lunar new year\\u2019s day dawned , the government had gone even further. More than 50 million people were in lockdown across the country, and nearly every province in China had declared a \\u201clevel 1\\u201d health emergency, the most serious kind, which allows quarantines and other serious measures.\\n\\nYet all this may come too late to ward off a major public health crisis, infectious disease experts have warned. Yi Guan, a senior Hong Kong-based virologist who helped identify the cause of the Sars virus, said he was much more worried about this disease, and feared the window for controlling its spread might already have closed.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ve never felt scared. This time I\\u2019m scared,\\u201d Yi, who heads the University of Hong Kong\\u2019s state key laboratory of emerging infectious diseases, told China\\u2019s influential Caixin magazine.\\n\\nHe visited Wuhan expecting to find the city on a \\u201cwar footing\\u201d but instead was met with chaos and incompetence.\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think the local government has done what it should do,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey haven\\u2019t even been handing out quarantine guides to people who were leaving.\\u201d\\n\\nThe coronavirus could hardly have emerged at a worse time for Chinese authorities, appearing in the weeks before the lunar new year, China\\u2019s most important holiday. It is usually the occasion for the biggest human migration on the planet \\u2013 up to 3 billion trips \\u2013 as people race home to celebrate with family, travelling on packed trains, buses and planes.\\n\\nFor the army of migrant workers from rural towns and villages who have powered decades of economic growth in China, it can be the only time in the year they get to return home and see their children and parents who have stayed behind.\\n\\nEven as the scale of the crisis became apparent, millions whose travel plans did not take them near Wuhan packed their bags and set off for the annual reunion, although many journeys were longer than usual.\\n\\nEvidence that patients may be able to carry the disease without any fever, cough or other common symptoms has added to concern. Tests have showed that a child in one family who did not appear unwell was in fact carrying the disease, the Lancet has reported.\\n\\nBut widespread apprehension has changed the nature of the celebration. Normally a time for parties and celebration, banquets and fireworks, instead across the country \\u2013 even in places far from the centre or any reported cases \\u2013 people were cancelling their party plans and staying home.\\n\\nStreets, malls and restaurants were empty, attractions from the Great Wall to the Forbidden City and Shanghai\\u2019s Disneyland had closed, and from Monday all group tourism \\u2013 domestic and foreign \\u2013 will be suspended.\\n\\nInstead, many people stayed at home, and took to the internet to find out more about the crisis. From the early days of the outbreak, warnings were appearing on China\\u2019s vibrant but censored social media. In early January, eight people were arrested for \\u201cspreading hoaxes\\u201d about what came to be known as the coronavirus, AFP reported.\\n\\nWeeks later, vast numbers of people were turning to the internet for information about the crisis, as state media downplayed it and kept it off the front page of official papers, such as the People\\u2019s Daily, and out of the main headlines on key television news programmes.\\n\\nOn Saturday, discussion about the disease on micro-blogging site Weibo had reached 8 billion views, according to the What\\u2019s on Weibo website. \\u201cIt\\u2019s very rare to see news topics get this big,\\u201d site editor Manya Koetse said on Twitter.\\n\\nBy Saturday evening, China had confirmed it was dealing with a total of 1,372 confirmed cases, and a death toll of 41. Together with cases identified outside China \\u2013 spread from Australia to the United States and France \\u2013 more than 1,400 people have been infected. By comparison, during the main Sars epidemic, which lasted from late 2002 until July 2003, in total 8,098 people got sick, and 774 died.\\n\\nAlthough most of the victims who have died from this new coronavirus have been older, and some have been in bad health, more people could be at risk if overwhelmed hospitals are not able to treat those with the disease. There is no cure or vaccine, but medical support can help patients\\u2019 own immune systems to fight the disease.\\n\\nXia \\u2013 who is no longer feverish but has a bad cough, often producing blood \\u2013 says she is comforted by the actions of the central government now in taking control.\\n\\n\\u201cAt this point I think the focus should be on how, together, we\\u2019re going to pull through,\\u201d she said. But she thinks Wuhan officials will bear the brunt of scrutiny in coming weeks and months.\\n\\n\\u201cThere can be no doubt they simply missed the best time for containing the outbreak,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThe Wuhan government didn\\u2019t offer timely and effective support to hospitals in terms of medical materials \\u2026 they failed to raise awareness among the public.\\u201d\", \"author\": \"Emma Graham-Harrison and Michael Standaert\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/26/coronavirus-from-food-market-to-global-panic-response-mistakes\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 04:20:28 GMT\", \"published_utc\": 1580030428, \"collection_utc\": 1580041401}",News,1580030428

On 13 January, Chinese authorities said they had not identified any new cases for over a week; and although a first case was reported outside the country in a traveller to China, she had first developed symptoms days earlier.\\n\\nIf the disease came only from eating some kind of infected animal, and the market where it had originated was shut, there was perhaps a real possibility that no further cases would appear.\\n\\nBut it has now emerged that even though China freely shared details of the cases it had identified in the early days of January, doctors on the ground in the city where the disease began were not testing widely for the new virus as the month progressed.\\n\\nThere is growing concern that a failure to carry out comprehensive testing during the early days of the outbreak could have helped the virus spread.\\n\\nXia believes she is one of many victims who do not show up in statistics; she was finally admitted to hospital on the day after the genetic code was released. Despite her link to the market at the centre of the outbreak, and symptoms that matched those of confirmed victims, she was never tested.\\n\\n\\u201cBefore there were any testing kits, which was before 16 January, I was regarded as a highly suspected case, meaning that I showed almost all of the symptoms,\\u201d Xia told the Observer.\\n\\nBut the hospital was already struggling with a sharp increase in patients showing symptoms that matched the reported coronavirus ones. Xia estimates that there were only two doctors on staff to check hundreds of people seeking help.\\n\\nTerribly overstretched, they focused only on the most serious cases and so on 20 January doctors discharged Xia into the care of her parents, without even formally noting her link to the South China seafood market on medical notes.\\n\\nThat was the day China confirmed the disease could be spread between humans, rather than just picked up direct from an animal source.\\n\\nThe number of patients had tripled, cases had appeared in other major cities, including the capital Beijing, and in a sign of official concern, the country\\u2019s authoritarian president, Xi Jinping, made his first comments on the virus, saying it must be \\u201cresolutely contained\\u201d.\\n\\nYet Xia was sent home, still sick, without having been tested. She is being cared for by her parents, but is terrified she might infect them; they try to protect themselves by staying five metres away from her at all times.\\n\\nThree days later, China stunned its citizens and the world by putting Wuhan under quarantine. From the morning of 23 January, no trains, planes or public transport would be allowed to leave the city; roadblocks later stopped most private cars from leaving either.\\n\\nClosing off a major industrial and commercial hub, home to 11 million people, was the bluntest possible admission that Beijing was now extremely worried about the new disease. Further decisive action included a pledge to build a new 1,000-bed hospital dedicated to the disease in under a week, and a second within two weeks.\\n\\nWork has already started on the first, and given China\\u2019s track record of throwing up a similar hospital in Beijing during the Sars crisis, there is little doubt that the prefabricated facility will be finished in this extraordinary timescale.\\n\\nAnd in a sign that authorities had shifted from trying to downplay the disease, a very last-minute tribute to the doctors and nurses battling the disease was included in the new year television gala show, one of the most high-profile broadcasts of the year.\\n\\nBy the time lunar new year\\u2019s day dawned , the government had gone even further. More than 50 million people were in lockdown across the country, and nearly every province in China had declared a \\u201clevel 1\\u201d health emergency, the most serious kind, which allows quarantines and other serious measures.\\n\\nYet all this may come too late to ward off a major public health crisis, infectious disease experts have warned. Yi Guan, a senior Hong Kong-based virologist who helped identify the cause of the Sars virus, said he was much more worried about this disease, and feared the window for controlling its spread might already have closed.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ve never felt scared.

By then, authorities had closed the seafood market for disinfection, and identified 44 patients with the unknown pneumonia.\\n\\nBut when she went to a local hospital on 4 January for a check-up, no one asked Xia about possible links to the market, or mentioned the mystery new illness. Doctors told her to go home, rest and take over-the-counter medication.\\n\\nShe followed their advice but her condition continued to worsen. Her fever intensified, she started having respiratory problems, and eating or drinking became painful.\\n\\nHer illness was developing in tandem with knowledge about the mysterious new outbreak. On 9 January, China announced it had identified a new coronavirus, from the same family that caused the 2002 Sars outbreak, in one of the Wuhan patients. Like all viruses in the corona family, it had originated in an animal; scientists were already racing to uncover the source.\\n\\nThe next day, authorities announced the first death from the disease and released the genetic sequence of the new virus online for study, winning plaudits for an approach that seemed very different from the official cover-up that exacerbated the Sars crisis.\\n\\nThere were even hopes that Beijing might have managed to stop the outbreak before it had really begun.

From the morning of 23 January, no trains, planes or public transport would be allowed to leave the city; roadblocks later stopped most private cars from leaving either.\\n\\nClosing off a major industrial and commercial hub, home to 11 million people, was the bluntest possible admission that Beijing was now extremely worried about the new disease. Further decisive action included a pledge to build a new 1,000-bed hospital dedicated to the disease in under a week, and a second within two weeks.\\n\\nWork has already started on the first, and given China\\u2019s track record of throwing up a similar hospital in Beijing during the Sars crisis, there is little doubt that the prefabricated facility will be finished in this extraordinary timescale.\\n\\nAnd in a sign that authorities had shifted from trying to downplay the disease, a very last-minute tribute to the doctors and nurses battling the disease was included in the new year television gala show, one of the most high-profile broadcasts of the year.\\n\\nBy the time lunar new year\\u2019s day dawned , the government had gone even further.

SARS and MERS sickened thousands of people around the world and caused hundreds of deaths.\\n\\nAs of Friday, 18 people between the ages 3 to 58 had been tested for the virus in California, according to the state Department of Public Health. They included a traveler who arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on a flight from Mexico City and was taken to a hospital early Thursday for an evaluation.\\n\\nDr. Sonia Angell, director of the California Department of Public Health, said in a video statement last week that the immediate health risk to the general public in California is low, based on current information, but that the department is carefully monitoring the virus and considers it \\u201ca serious public health concern.\\u201d\\n\\nBesides the Orange County case, only two other people have tested positive for the virus in the United States \\u2014 a man in Washington state and a woman in Illinois.\\n\\nThough the U.S. has not seen a major outbreak, the virus has spread widely across Asia in the last month, killing at least 56 people and sickening 2,000 more in China, according to officials there.\\n\\nIn China, the pneumonia-like illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus first appeared last month in Wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub in central China\\u2019s Hubei province. Other cases have been reported in Japan, South Korea and Thailand. Singapore, Vietnam and Hong Kong reported their first cases Thursday.\\n\\nAccording to the Associated Press, the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan will evacuate its personnel and some private citizens aboard a charter flight Tuesday.

Officials said the man is in his 50s and recently flew from Wuhan to Guangzhou, China, and then on to Toronto on Jan. 23.\\n\\nThe first coronavirus cases in Europe have also been confirmed, with three patients being treated in French hospitals. All three had recently traveled to China; they were reportedly doing well, according to officials.\\n\\nLast week, federal authorities announced that passengers flying from Wuhan into LAX, San Francisco International Airport and John F.

Initially, I started exploring online forums, seeking others with my own niche interests. Much of the stuff was pretty hardcore. Some swore that regular doses of beetroot juice could boost my performance. Others suggested forgoing meat. Perhaps experimenting at altitude might help.\\n\\nBut a consensus quickly emerged: if I wanted to run a sub-three-hour marathon, the best thing I could do was buy a pair of Nike Vaporfly shoes. With a price tag of \\u00a3240 and a running life of only about 200 miles, the shoes cost anywhere between two and three times the price of others. But almost everyone swore they were worth it. As one forum dweller said: \\u201cThey really are magic.\\u201d\\n\\nFor once, the hype matched reality. Using data taken from users of the running app Strava, the New York Times reported that, yes, it was just as Nike claimed: the shoes could shave about 4% off a marathon time for certain runners.

Alice Vincent\\u2019s Rootbound, which comes out later this month, is a deeply personal exploration of the healing power of plants. Luke Turner\\u2019s Out of the Woods notes the link \\u2013 both literal and metaphorical \\u2013 between the forest and his own sexuality. Elizabeth Jane Burnett\\u2019s The Grassling is a document on grief; the wildlife of Devon connects her to her dying father, while the Swahili words she often uses to talk about it connect her to her mother.\\n\\nIn The Outrun, meanwhile, Amy Liptrot restokes her relationship with nature as she battles with sobriety. Zakiya Mckenzie is one of the first writers in residence for the Forestry Commission. Jessica Lee\\u2019s The Willowherb Review focuses on new nature writing by emerging and established writers of colour. And in Losing Eden, Jones delves deep to try to understand her \\u201cpsychological need for the natural world\\u201d, and wonders what our current \\u201cbiological annihilation\\u201d will do to the mind and spirit of her infant daughter.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a genre people find it really easy to be sniffy about,\\u201d says Vincent of nature writing. Her book, which begins with the sudden and painful end of a long-term relationship, reacts to plants from a storytelling, historical and social point of view, rather than a particularly scientific one. She accepts that some people may view Rootbound as, \\u201csnowflake millennial is sad and discovers plants\\u201d, but believes that the stereotype hides a truth \\u2013 that \\u201cwe\\u2019re hungry for something\\u201d. We are clamouring for the outdoors, she says, \\u201cbecause we\\u2019ve pretty much had it ripped from us as a generation\\u201d.\\n\\nOf course, people have been writing about nature, and its relationship with the human condition, for centuries \\u2013 look at the Romantic poets \\u2013 but it\\u2019s only recently that they are doing so in the context of a capitalism-fuelled climate crisis, and in a world that has shackled itself to technology.\\n\\n\\u201cI think we\\u2019ve been sleepwalking into a place where we think we\\u2019re separate from the rest of nature,\\u201d says Jones, \\u201cand that we can live the way we do without truly thinking about what that means.\\u201d Where Vincent\\u2019s book has at its heart a smaller, more domestic kind of nature \\u2013 namely her garden balcony, whose plants she describes with an infectious tenderness \\u2013 Jones takes a more macro approach. In seeking to discover how the climate chaos, extinction and environmental degradation affects the human spirit, she visits a manmade deep-freeze in the Arctic containing nearly a million seed samples, and one of Europe\\u2019s last remaining primeval forests, in Poland, which is facing intensive logging.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s in the last five years that the consequences of our separation from nature are really being shown to us \\u2013 through species loss, biodiversity loss, the climate crisis,\\u201d she continues, \\u201cbut also the health repercussions for humans. The more time goes on, the more we see how crucial that link can be, and how nature can help all manner of mental health problems.\\u201d\\n\\nJust like Vincent, Turner, Liptrot, Burnett and others, Jones brings a personal element to her memoir. Alongside the interviews with scientists and the field research are frank accounts of her battle with depression and treatment for alcoholism. Spending time in nature became an important part of her recovery. It was a form of therapy for her \\u2013 though she is quick to point out that this was alongside medicine, psychiatry, psychotherapy and support. \\u201cI say that because the idea of \\u2018ditch your pills, just go into the trees\\u2019 \\u2013 I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nAt its worst, that is how nature writing can be. \\u201cThe genre of \\u2018white people go outside\\u2019 is difficult to deny,\\u201d agrees Vincent. Turner is suspicious of large swathes of the genre. In his book, after breaking up with his girlfriend because he had an urgent desire \\u201cto feel the naked press of a man on top of me\\u201d (break-ups seem to crop up a lot in nature writing), Turner spends time in Epping Forest looking for clarity, hoping that being among the trees will unlock \\u201ca wilder, truer, more spiritual self\\u201d. But his relationship with nature is not a romanticised one. \\u201cMuch of what I found in the genre bothered me,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt was very posh people writing exultantly about the great insight they\\u2019d gleaned from buying a farm/cottage and wandering around it all day. It all felt very exclusionary and privileged.\\u201d\\n\\nAccess to nature is often exclusionary in itself. As Jones\\u2019s book points out, a small proportion of the population own the vast majority of the countryside in the UK, and only 3 per cent is common land. Ever since the countryside was fenced off and sold off, thanks to the enclosure acts from the 18th century onwards, our relationship with nature has become more and more proprietary, and easy access to it has become more and more class-based. With that in mind, Turner is wary of a kind of nature writing that \\u201cothers the natural world\\u201d. He believes we need to see humans as part of nature, not separate and superior to it.\\n\\nBut while othering is unhelpful, there is something to be said for writing that evokes a sense of awe in the natural world \\u2013 even in its most quotidian forms. Vincent writes evocatively of how sticky weed was a childhood weapon, and of autumn as \\u201cnature\\u2019s beautiful death, the leaves set ablaze before carpeting the ground, letting in winter\\u2019s rages so that life can gather strength below the earth\\u201d. The Grassling is full of similarly sumptuous writing. \\u201cThe great oak sags with low roses,\\u201d Burnett writes, \\u201cdog rose floats high over crab apples. Above the loosestrife, the field sways apricot with wheat, terracotta earth freshly fallen from the blade.\\u201d Jones recalls her favourite tree, and how \\u201cits green deepened for the summer before becoming tumescent with fruit, blowing up the pears until they dropped to the ground \\u2013 through heaviness and insect wear and tear \\u2013 gloopy and fleshy\\u201d.\\n\\nJones makes a point of combining uncomfortable truths \\u2013 \\u201cMy daughter and her generation were born into a time of extraordinary disconnection, rapid climate destruction and psychological retreat from the rest of the living world\\u201d \\u2013 with a more lyrical sort of writing.\\n\\n\\u201cWith this dysfunctional place that we\\u2019re in at the moment,\\u201d she tells me, \\u201cI\\u2019m sure that the solution is love and awe. I tried to get across the infinite variety and absurd abundance of the natural world. Nature can be presented as quite staid and manicured, but actually it\\u2019s so\\u2026 weird.

And in Losing Eden, Jones delves deep to try to understand her \\u201cpsychological need for the natural world\\u201d, and wonders what our current \\u201cbiological annihilation\\u201d will do to the mind and spirit of her infant daughter.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a genre people find it really easy to be sniffy about,\\u201d says Vincent of nature writing. Her book, which begins with the sudden and painful end of a long-term relationship, reacts to plants from a storytelling, historical and social point of view, rather than a particularly scientific one. She accepts that some people may view Rootbound as, \\u201csnowflake millennial is sad and discovers plants\\u201d, but believes that the stereotype hides a truth \\u2013 that \\u201cwe\\u2019re hungry for something\\u201d. We are clamouring for the outdoors, she says, \\u201cbecause we\\u2019ve pretty much had it ripped from us as a generation\\u201d.\\n\\nOf course, people have been writing about nature, and its relationship with the human condition, for centuries \\u2013 look at the Romantic poets \\u2013 but it\\u2019s only recently that they are doing so in the context of a capitalism-fuelled climate crisis, and in a world that has shackled itself to technology.\\n\\n\\u201cI think we\\u2019ve been sleepwalking into a place where we think we\\u2019re separate from the rest of nature,\\u201d says Jones, \\u201cand that we can live the way we do without truly thinking about what that means.\\u201d Where Vincent\\u2019s book has at its heart a smaller, more domestic kind of nature \\u2013 namely her garden balcony, whose plants she describes with an infectious tenderness \\u2013 Jones takes a more macro approach. In seeking to discover how the climate chaos, extinction and environmental degradation affects the human spirit, she visits a manmade deep-freeze in the Arctic containing nearly a million seed samples, and one of Europe\\u2019s last remaining primeval forests, in Poland, which is facing intensive logging.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s in the last five years that the consequences of our separation from nature are really being shown to us \\u2013 through species loss, biodiversity loss, the climate crisis,\\u201d she continues, \\u201cbut also the health repercussions for humans. The more time goes on, the more we see how crucial that link can be, and how nature can help all manner of mental health problems.\\u201d\\n\\nJust like Vincent, Turner, Liptrot, Burnett and others, Jones brings a personal element to her memoir. Alongside the interviews with scientists and the field research are frank accounts of her battle with depression and treatment for alcoholism. Spending time in nature became an important part of her recovery. It was a form of therapy for her \\u2013 though she is quick to point out that this was alongside medicine, psychiatry, psychotherapy and support. \\u201cI say that because the idea of \\u2018ditch your pills, just go into the trees\\u2019 \\u2013 I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nAt its worst, that is how nature writing can be. \\u201cThe genre of \\u2018white people go outside\\u2019 is difficult to deny,\\u201d agrees Vincent. Turner is suspicious of large swathes of the genre. In his book, after breaking up with his girlfriend because he had an urgent desire \\u201cto feel the naked press of a man on top of me\\u201d (break-ups seem to crop up a lot in nature writing), Turner spends time in Epping Forest looking for clarity, hoping that being among the trees will unlock \\u201ca wilder, truer, more spiritual self\\u201d. But his relationship with nature is not a romanticised one. \\u201cMuch of what I found in the genre bothered me,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt was very posh people writing exultantly about the great insight they\\u2019d gleaned from buying a farm/cottage and wandering around it all day. It all felt very exclusionary and privileged.\\u201d\\n\\nAccess to nature is often exclusionary in itself. As Jones\\u2019s book points out, a small proportion of the population own the vast majority of the countryside in the UK, and only 3 per cent is common land. Ever since the countryside was fenced off and sold off, thanks to the enclosure acts from the 18th century onwards, our relationship with nature has become more and more proprietary, and easy access to it has become more and more class-based. With that in mind, Turner is wary of a kind of nature writing that \\u201cothers the natural world\\u201d. He believes we need to see humans as part of nature, not separate and superior to it.\\n\\nBut while othering is unhelpful, there is something to be said for writing that evokes a sense of awe in the natural world \\u2013 even in its most quotidian forms. Vincent writes evocatively of how sticky weed was a childhood weapon, and of autumn as \\u201cnature\\u2019s beautiful death, the leaves set ablaze before carpeting the ground, letting in winter\\u2019s rages so that life can gather strength below the earth\\u201d. The Grassling is full of similarly sumptuous writing. \\u201cThe great oak sags with low roses,\\u201d Burnett writes, \\u201cdog rose floats high over crab apples. Above the loosestrife, the field sways apricot with wheat, terracotta earth freshly fallen from the blade.\\u201d Jones recalls her favourite tree, and how \\u201cits green deepened for the summer before becoming tumescent with fruit, blowing up the pears until they dropped to the ground \\u2013 through heaviness and insect wear and tear \\u2013 gloopy and fleshy\\u201d.\\n\\nJones makes a point of combining uncomfortable truths \\u2013 \\u201cMy daughter and her generation were born into a time of extraordinary disconnection, rapid climate destruction and psychological retreat from the rest of the living world\\u201d \\u2013 with a more lyrical sort of writing.\\n\\n\\u201cWith this dysfunctional place that we\\u2019re in at the moment,\\u201d she tells me, \\u201cI\\u2019m sure that the solution is love and awe. I tried to get across the infinite variety and absurd abundance of the natural world. Nature can be presented as quite staid and manicured, but actually it\\u2019s so\\u2026 weird. I wanted to try and disrupt the oldschool way of looking at nature, and try to express the wonder and the weirdness and the enchantment of it. There\\u2019s so much out there to delight in and glory at and feel moved by.\\u201d\\n\\nAt its best, writing about the natural world \\u2013 whether it\\u2019s an old-growth forest in eastern Europe, a Devon wheat field or a micro-shrub on a city balcony \\u2013 can make it all seem worth fighting for.\\n\\nAlice Vincent\\u2019s Rootbound is out on 30 January.

And we want it back.\\n\\nMaybe that\\u2019s why there\\u2019s such an abundance of nature memoirs at the moment. Alice Vincent\\u2019s Rootbound, which comes out later this month, is a deeply personal exploration of the healing power of plants. Luke Turner\\u2019s Out of the Woods notes the link \\u2013 both literal and metaphorical \\u2013 between the forest and his own sexuality. Elizabeth Jane Burnett\\u2019s The Grassling is a document on grief; the wildlife of Devon connects her to her dying father, while the Swahili words she often uses to talk about it connect her to her mother.\\n\\nIn The Outrun, meanwhile, Amy Liptrot restokes her relationship with nature as she battles with sobriety. Zakiya Mckenzie is one of the first writers in residence for the Forestry Commission. Jessica Lee\\u2019s The Willowherb Review focuses on new nature writing by emerging and established writers of colour. And in Losing Eden, Jones delves deep to try to understand her \\u201cpsychological need for the natural world\\u201d, and wonders what our current \\u201cbiological annihilation\\u201d will do to the mind and spirit of her infant daughter.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a genre people find it really easy to be sniffy about,\\u201d says Vincent of nature writing. Her book, which begins with the sudden and painful end of a long-term relationship, reacts to plants from a storytelling, historical and social point of view, rather than a particularly scientific one. She accepts that some people may view Rootbound as, \\u201csnowflake millennial is sad and discovers plants\\u201d, but believes that the stereotype hides a truth \\u2013 that \\u201cwe\\u2019re hungry for something\\u201d. We are clamouring for the outdoors, she says, \\u201cbecause we\\u2019ve pretty much had it ripped from us as a generation\\u201d.\\n\\nOf course, people have been writing about nature, and its relationship with the human condition, for centuries \\u2013 look at the Romantic poets \\u2013 but it\\u2019s only recently that they are doing so in the context of a capitalism-fuelled climate crisis, and in a world that has shackled itself to technology.\\n\\n\\u201cI think we\\u2019ve been sleepwalking into a place where we think we\\u2019re separate from the rest of nature,\\u201d says Jones, \\u201cand that we can live the way we do without truly thinking about what that means.\\u201d Where Vincent\\u2019s book has at its heart a smaller, more domestic kind of nature \\u2013 namely her garden balcony, whose plants she describes with an infectious tenderness \\u2013 Jones takes a more macro approach. In seeking to discover how the climate chaos, extinction and environmental degradation affects the human spirit, she visits a manmade deep-freeze in the Arctic containing nearly a million seed samples, and one of Europe\\u2019s last remaining primeval forests, in Poland, which is facing intensive logging.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s in the last five years that the consequences of our separation from nature are really being shown to us \\u2013 through species loss, biodiversity loss, the climate crisis,\\u201d she continues, \\u201cbut also the health repercussions for humans. The more time goes on, the more we see how crucial that link can be, and how nature can help all manner of mental health problems.\\u201d\\n\\nJust like Vincent, Turner, Liptrot, Burnett and others, Jones brings a personal element to her memoir. Alongside the interviews with scientists and the field research are frank accounts of her battle with depression and treatment for alcoholism. Spending time in nature became an important part of her recovery. It was a form of therapy for her \\u2013 though she is quick to point out that this was alongside medicine, psychiatry, psychotherapy and support. \\u201cI say that because the idea of \\u2018ditch your pills, just go into the trees\\u2019 \\u2013 I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nAt its worst, that is how nature writing can be. \\u201cThe genre of \\u2018white people go outside\\u2019 is difficult to deny,\\u201d agrees Vincent. Turner is suspicious of large swathes of the genre. In his book, after breaking up with his girlfriend because he had an urgent desire \\u201cto feel the naked press of a man on top of me\\u201d (break-ups seem to crop up a lot in nature writing), Turner spends time in Epping Forest looking for clarity, hoping that being among the trees will unlock \\u201ca wilder, truer, more spiritual self\\u201d. But his relationship with nature is not a romanticised one. \\u201cMuch of what I found in the genre bothered me,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt was very posh people writing exultantly about the great insight they\\u2019d gleaned from buying a farm/cottage and wandering around it all day. It all felt very exclusionary and privileged.\\u201d\\n\\nAccess to nature is often exclusionary in itself. As Jones\\u2019s book points out, a small proportion of the population own the vast majority of the countryside in the UK, and only 3 per cent is common land. Ever since the countryside was fenced off and sold off, thanks to the enclosure acts from the 18th century onwards, our relationship with nature has become more and more proprietary, and easy access to it has become more and more class-based. With that in mind, Turner is wary of a kind of nature writing that \\u201cothers the natural world\\u201d. He believes we need to see humans as part of nature, not separate and superior to it.\\n\\nBut while othering is unhelpful, there is something to be said for writing that evokes a sense of awe in the natural world \\u2013 even in its most quotidian forms. Vincent writes evocatively of how sticky weed was a childhood weapon, and of autumn as \\u201cnature\\u2019s beautiful death, the leaves set ablaze before carpeting the ground, letting in winter\\u2019s rages so that life can gather strength below the earth\\u201d. The Grassling is full of similarly sumptuous writing. \\u201cThe great oak sags with low roses,\\u201d Burnett writes, \\u201cdog rose floats high over crab apples. Above the loosestrife, the field sways apricot with wheat, terracotta earth freshly fallen from the blade.\\u201d Jones recalls her favourite tree, and how \\u201cits green deepened for the summer before becoming tumescent with fruit, blowing up the pears until they dropped to the ground \\u2013 through heaviness and insect wear and tear \\u2013 gloopy and fleshy\\u201d.\\n\\nJones makes a point of combining uncomfortable truths \\u2013 \\u201cMy daughter and her generation were born into a time of extraordinary disconnection, rapid climate destruction and psychological retreat from the rest of the living world\\u201d \\u2013 with a more lyrical sort of writing.\\n\\n\\u201cWith this dysfunctional place that we\\u2019re in at the moment,\\u201d she tells me, \\u201cI\\u2019m sure that the solution is love and awe. I tried to get across the infinite variety and absurd abundance of the natural world. Nature can be presented as quite staid and manicured, but actually it\\u2019s so\\u2026 weird. I wanted to try and disrupt the oldschool way of looking at nature, and try to express the wonder and the weirdness and the enchantment of it. There\\u2019s so much out there to delight in and glory at and feel moved by.\\u201d\\n\\nAt its best, writing about the natural world \\u2013 whether it\\u2019s an old-growth forest in eastern Europe, a Devon wheat field or a micro-shrub on a city balcony \\u2013 can make it all seem worth fighting for.\\n\\nAlice Vincent\\u2019s Rootbound is out on 30 January.

Her book, which begins with the sudden and painful end of a long-term relationship, reacts to plants from a storytelling, historical and social point of view, rather than a particularly scientific one. She accepts that some people may view Rootbound as, \\u201csnowflake millennial is sad and discovers plants\\u201d, but believes that the stereotype hides a truth \\u2013 that \\u201cwe\\u2019re hungry for something\\u201d. We are clamouring for the outdoors, she says, \\u201cbecause we\\u2019ve pretty much had it ripped from us as a generation\\u201d.\\n\\nOf course, people have been writing about nature, and its relationship with the human condition, for centuries \\u2013 look at the Romantic poets \\u2013 but it\\u2019s only recently that they are doing so in the context of a capitalism-fuelled climate crisis, and in a world that has shackled itself to technology.\\n\\n\\u201cI think we\\u2019ve been sleepwalking into a place where we think we\\u2019re separate from the rest of nature,\\u201d says Jones, \\u201cand that we can live the way we do without truly thinking about what that means.\\u201d Where Vincent\\u2019s book has at its heart a smaller, more domestic kind of nature \\u2013 namely her garden balcony, whose plants she describes with an infectious tenderness \\u2013 Jones takes a more macro approach. In seeking to discover how the climate chaos, extinction and environmental degradation affects the human spirit, she visits a manmade deep-freeze in the Arctic containing nearly a million seed samples, and one of Europe\\u2019s last remaining primeval forests, in Poland, which is facing intensive logging.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s in the last five years that the consequences of our separation from nature are really being shown to us \\u2013 through species loss, biodiversity loss, the climate crisis,\\u201d she continues, \\u201cbut also the health repercussions for humans. The more time goes on, the more we see how crucial that link can be, and how nature can help all manner of mental health problems.\\u201d\\n\\nJust like Vincent, Turner, Liptrot, Burnett and others, Jones brings a personal element to her memoir. Alongside the interviews with scientists and the field research are frank accounts of her battle with depression and treatment for alcoholism. Spending time in nature became an important part of her recovery. It was a form of therapy for her \\u2013 though she is quick to point out that this was alongside medicine, psychiatry, psychotherapy and support. \\u201cI say that because the idea of \\u2018ditch your pills, just go into the trees\\u2019 \\u2013 I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nAt its worst, that is how nature writing can be. \\u201cThe genre of \\u2018white people go outside\\u2019 is difficult to deny,\\u201d agrees Vincent. Turner is suspicious of large swathes of the genre. In his book, after breaking up with his girlfriend because he had an urgent desire \\u201cto feel the naked press of a man on top of me\\u201d (break-ups seem to crop up a lot in nature writing), Turner spends time in Epping Forest looking for clarity, hoping that being among the trees will unlock \\u201ca wilder, truer, more spiritual self\\u201d. But his relationship with nature is not a romanticised one. \\u201cMuch of what I found in the genre bothered me,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt was very posh people writing exultantly about the great insight they\\u2019d gleaned from buying a farm/cottage and wandering around it all day. It all felt very exclusionary and privileged.\\u201d\\n\\nAccess to nature is often exclusionary in itself. As Jones\\u2019s book points out, a small proportion of the population own the vast majority of the countryside in the UK, and only 3 per cent is common land. Ever since the countryside was fenced off and sold off, thanks to the enclosure acts from the 18th century onwards, our relationship with nature has become more and more proprietary, and easy access to it has become more and more class-based. With that in mind, Turner is wary of a kind of nature writing that \\u201cothers the natural world\\u201d. He believes we need to see humans as part of nature, not separate and superior to it.\\n\\nBut while othering is unhelpful, there is something to be said for writing that evokes a sense of awe in the natural world \\u2013 even in its most quotidian forms. Vincent writes evocatively of how sticky weed was a childhood weapon, and of autumn as \\u201cnature\\u2019s beautiful death, the leaves set ablaze before carpeting the ground, letting in winter\\u2019s rages so that life can gather strength below the earth\\u201d. The Grassling is full of similarly sumptuous writing. \\u201cThe great oak sags with low roses,\\u201d Burnett writes, \\u201cdog rose floats high over crab apples. Above the loosestrife, the field sways apricot with wheat, terracotta earth freshly fallen from the blade.\\u201d Jones recalls her favourite tree, and how \\u201cits green deepened for the summer before becoming tumescent with fruit, blowing up the pears until they dropped to the ground \\u2013 through heaviness and insect wear and tear \\u2013 gloopy and fleshy\\u201d.\\n\\nJones makes a point of combining uncomfortable truths \\u2013 \\u201cMy daughter and her generation were born into a time of extraordinary disconnection, rapid climate destruction and psychological retreat from the rest of the living world\\u201d \\u2013 with a more lyrical sort of writing.\\n\\n\\u201cWith this dysfunctional place that we\\u2019re in at the moment,\\u201d she tells me, \\u201cI\\u2019m sure that the solution is love and awe. I tried to get across the infinite variety and absurd abundance of the natural world. Nature can be presented as quite staid and manicured, but actually it\\u2019s so\\u2026 weird. I wanted to try and disrupt the oldschool way of looking at nature, and try to express the wonder and the weirdness and the enchantment of it. There\\u2019s so much out there to delight in and glory at and feel moved by.\\u201d\\n\\nAt its best, writing about the natural world \\u2013 whether it\\u2019s an old-growth forest in eastern Europe, a Devon wheat field or a micro-shrub on a city balcony \\u2013 can make it all seem worth fighting for.\\n\\nAlice Vincent\\u2019s Rootbound is out on 30 January.

As humanity has industrialised, commodified, gentrified and all-but destroyed the natural world \\u2013 as we have shut ourselves off from it in cars and offices and flats \\u2013 we have simultaneously found ourselves craving it. \\u201cThe civilising process which imperils wild nature,\\u201d says the environmental historian Roderick Nash, as quoted in Jones\\u2019s galvanising new book Losing Eden, \\u201cis precisely that which creates the need for it\\u201d. Or, as Joni Mitchell would put it, we\\u2019ve paved paradise and put up a parking lot. And we want it back.\\n\\nMaybe that\\u2019s why there\\u2019s such an abundance of nature memoirs at the moment. Alice Vincent\\u2019s Rootbound, which comes out later this month, is a deeply personal exploration of the healing power of plants. Luke Turner\\u2019s Out of the Woods notes the link \\u2013 both literal and metaphorical \\u2013 between the forest and his own sexuality. Elizabeth Jane Burnett\\u2019s The Grassling is a document on grief; the wildlife of Devon connects her to her dying father, while the Swahili words she often uses to talk about it connect her to her mother.\\n\\nIn The Outrun, meanwhile, Amy Liptrot restokes her relationship with nature as she battles with sobriety. Zakiya Mckenzie is one of the first writers in residence for the Forestry Commission. Jessica Lee\\u2019s The Willowherb Review focuses on new nature writing by emerging and established writers of colour. And in Losing Eden, Jones delves deep to try to understand her \\u201cpsychological need for the natural world\\u201d, and wonders what our current \\u201cbiological annihilation\\u201d will do to the mind and spirit of her infant daughter.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a genre people find it really easy to be sniffy about,\\u201d says Vincent of nature writing. Her book, which begins with the sudden and painful end of a long-term relationship, reacts to plants from a storytelling, historical and social point of view, rather than a particularly scientific one. She accepts that some people may view Rootbound as, \\u201csnowflake millennial is sad and discovers plants\\u201d, but believes that the stereotype hides a truth \\u2013 that \\u201cwe\\u2019re hungry for something\\u201d. We are clamouring for the outdoors, she says, \\u201cbecause we\\u2019ve pretty much had it ripped from us as a generation\\u201d.\\n\\nOf course, people have been writing about nature, and its relationship with the human condition, for centuries \\u2013 look at the Romantic poets \\u2013 but it\\u2019s only recently that they are doing so in the context of a capitalism-fuelled climate crisis, and in a world that has shackled itself to technology.\\n\\n\\u201cI think we\\u2019ve been sleepwalking into a place where we think we\\u2019re separate from the rest of nature,\\u201d says Jones, \\u201cand that we can live the way we do without truly thinking about what that means.\\u201d Where Vincent\\u2019s book has at its heart a smaller, more domestic kind of nature \\u2013 namely her garden balcony, whose plants she describes with an infectious tenderness \\u2013 Jones takes a more macro approach. In seeking to discover how the climate chaos, extinction and environmental degradation affects the human spirit, she visits a manmade deep-freeze in the Arctic containing nearly a million seed samples, and one of Europe\\u2019s last remaining primeval forests, in Poland, which is facing intensive logging.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s in the last five years that the consequences of our separation from nature are really being shown to us \\u2013 through species loss, biodiversity loss, the climate crisis,\\u201d she continues, \\u201cbut also the health repercussions for humans. The more time goes on, the more we see how crucial that link can be, and how nature can help all manner of mental health problems.\\u201d\\n\\nJust like Vincent, Turner, Liptrot, Burnett and others, Jones brings a personal element to her memoir. Alongside the interviews with scientists and the field research are frank accounts of her battle with depression and treatment for alcoholism. Spending time in nature became an important part of her recovery. It was a form of therapy for her \\u2013 though she is quick to point out that this was alongside medicine, psychiatry, psychotherapy and support. \\u201cI say that because the idea of \\u2018ditch your pills, just go into the trees\\u2019 \\u2013 I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nAt its worst, that is how nature writing can be. \\u201cThe genre of \\u2018white people go outside\\u2019 is difficult to deny,\\u201d agrees Vincent. Turner is suspicious of large swathes of the genre. In his book, after breaking up with his girlfriend because he had an urgent desire \\u201cto feel the naked press of a man on top of me\\u201d (break-ups seem to crop up a lot in nature writing), Turner spends time in Epping Forest looking for clarity, hoping that being among the trees will unlock \\u201ca wilder, truer, more spiritual self\\u201d. But his relationship with nature is not a romanticised one. \\u201cMuch of what I found in the genre bothered me,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt was very posh people writing exultantly about the great insight they\\u2019d gleaned from buying a farm/cottage and wandering around it all day. It all felt very exclusionary and privileged.\\u201d\\n\\nAccess to nature is often exclusionary in itself. As Jones\\u2019s book points out, a small proportion of the population own the vast majority of the countryside in the UK, and only 3 per cent is common land. Ever since the countryside was fenced off and sold off, thanks to the enclosure acts from the 18th century onwards, our relationship with nature has become more and more proprietary, and easy access to it has become more and more class-based. With that in mind, Turner is wary of a kind of nature writing that \\u201cothers the natural world\\u201d. He believes we need to see humans as part of nature, not separate and superior to it.\\n\\nBut while othering is unhelpful, there is something to be said for writing that evokes a sense of awe in the natural world \\u2013 even in its most quotidian forms. Vincent writes evocatively of how sticky weed was a childhood weapon, and of autumn as \\u201cnature\\u2019s beautiful death, the leaves set ablaze before carpeting the ground, letting in winter\\u2019s rages so that life can gather strength below the earth\\u201d. The Grassling is full of similarly sumptuous writing. \\u201cThe great oak sags with low roses,\\u201d Burnett writes, \\u201cdog rose floats high over crab apples. Above the loosestrife, the field sways apricot with wheat, terracotta earth freshly fallen from the blade.\\u201d Jones recalls her favourite tree, and how \\u201cits green deepened for the summer before becoming tumescent with fruit, blowing up the pears until they dropped to the ground \\u2013 through heaviness and insect wear and tear \\u2013 gloopy and fleshy\\u201d.\\n\\nJones makes a point of combining uncomfortable truths \\u2013 \\u201cMy daughter and her generation were born into a time of extraordinary disconnection, rapid climate destruction and psychological retreat from the rest of the living world\\u201d \\u2013 with a more lyrical sort of writing.\\n\\n\\u201cWith this dysfunctional place that we\\u2019re in at the moment,\\u201d she tells me, \\u201cI\\u2019m sure that the solution is love and awe. I tried to get across the infinite variety and absurd abundance of the natural world. Nature can be presented as quite staid and manicured, but actually it\\u2019s so\\u2026 weird. I wanted to try and disrupt the oldschool way of looking at nature, and try to express the wonder and the weirdness and the enchantment of it. There\\u2019s so much out there to delight in and glory at and feel moved by.\\u201d\\n\\nAt its best, writing about the natural world \\u2013 whether it\\u2019s an old-growth forest in eastern Europe, a Devon wheat field or a micro-shrub on a city balcony \\u2013 can make it all seem worth fighting for.\\n\\nAlice Vincent\\u2019s Rootbound is out on 30 January.

Dozens have been killed and thousands infected across the country. Cases of the virus have also been found in the US.\\n\\u2022 Its impact on the Chinese economy will be significant, given that the virus is spreading during Lunar New Year \\u2014 a time when consumers spend a lot of money.\\n\\u2022 And the longer it drags down economic growth, the more Chinese policymakers will be tempted to return to their best trick to juice up the economy, raising the possibility that property markets could overheat.\\n\\u2022 This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.\\n\\nFor those who follow markets, starting the year with volatility emanating from China is all-too familiar. For years the country's bubbly behavior \\u2014 especially in its over-heating property markets \\u2014 gave markets convulsions almost like clockwork.\\n\\nBut then, it seemed, policymakers got something of a handle on things. They worked to put a lid on property market speculation while engaging in targeted stimulus measures to support vulnerable sectors of the economy during the trade war. It was a delicate balance.\\n\\nThe Wuhan coronavirus outbreak could threaten all of that.\\n\\nThe longer the virus goes without being contained, the more of a drag it will put on the economy. Analysts at Societe Generale estimate that if the spread of the virus \\\"fails to stabilize\\\" by March, first quarter GDP growth could fall below the 6%, the Chinese government's target.\\n\\n\\\"Without doubt, the hit would be most significant on domestic consumption and tourism-related sectors across the nation,\\\" Societe Generale analysts Wei Yao and Michelle Lam wrote in a recent note to clients.\\n\\n\\\"We could see first quarter retail sales growth decelerate by 0.5 [percentage points] to 7.2%, compared with our current forecast of 8%. Given the increased weight of consumption in the economy, the drag on overall growth from such a consumption shock would be more significant than in 2003, all other things being equal.\\\"\\n\\nAs Yao and Lam pointed out, the Chinese economy has changed significantly since the country last experienced a major outbreak. It's bigger, more consumption driven, and way more laden with debt.\\n\\nThe policy guidelines laid down last month at China's 2019 Central Economic Work Conference articulated how China planned to move the country forward under those conditions, while maintain the delicate balance I mentioned before.\\n\\nThe plan was to keep credit flowing, but to make conditions especially easy for private business and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). At the same time policymakers would focus on fixing zombie companies \\u2014 mostly big state owned enterprises (SOEs) \\u2014 and weening them off their addiction to credit. In order to make sure property markets stayed cool, policymakers also committed themselves to stressing that buying property was not for speculation.\\n\\nThat plan, combined with improvement in industrial and manufacturing sectors due to the end of the trade war, had many analysts \\u2014 including Yao and Lam \\u2014 thinking China's economy would remain stable for the first half of 2020.\\n\\nThe Wuhan virus throws that into question. Wuhan is the capital of Hubei province, an important manufacturing hub in China that represents 4% of the country's GDP. Putting the region on lockdown will likely slow industrial production, which had just bounced back to 6.9% in December from 6.2% in November.\\n\\nThe longer this virus spreads the more policymakers may feel compelled to ease credit conditions across the board, not just for SMEs and private enterprises. Yao and Lam wrote that a cut of Chinese banks' reserve requirement ratio or interest rate cuts would all be in the cards.

He was arguing that of the many who do make it across the border a disproportionate number do fit the description.\\n\\nAt this point, it needs to be asked why the Democrats deign to show so much care and compassion for those illegals breaching America\\u2019s border on a daily basis, at the very same time Democratic strongholds, like California and New York, are already bursting at the seams with tent cities and grinding poverty. Suffice it to consider a comment by a British tourist to San Francisco, the one-time crown gem of the increasingly tarnished, Democratic-controlled Golden State: \\u201cI can\\u2019t understand how anyone can live in a place where their everyday trip to get groceries or go to work includes a multitude of beggars asking for spare change or a meal.\\u201d\\n\\nConsidering that the Democrats can\\u2019t even take care of their own burgeoning problems in their primary constituencies, what is the real motivation behind their proposals to open the U.S. border and abolish U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)? After all, these are the very same people who screamed \\u2018not in my backyard!\\u2019 when Trump threatened to send all apprehended illegals to the so-called \\u2018sanctuary cities\\u2019. Nancy Pelosi skirted the periphery of racism when she called the idea \\u201cdisrespectful.\\u201d\\n\\nWould their sham benevolence have anything to do with securing more Democratic voters, or guaranteeing that the Republican Party eventually goes the way of the dinosaurs? Was New York Governor Andrew Cuomo motivated by pure compassion when he signed legislation granting driver\\u2019s licenses to illegal immigrants, who may now cast a \\u2018legal\\u2019 vote under New York\\u2019s notoriously loose voting laws? Now Democrats are demanding the elimination Voter ID rules, declaring them racist against minorities. This is one of the ways Berlatsky proposes to end so-called \\u201cracist voting\\u201d now purportedly contaminating U.S. politics.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s no secret that Hispanic Americans traditionally vote Democratic, and if that tendency were to change tomorrow you can bet that Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi would be camped out daily at the Mexican border, demanding the necessary funds to finish the project.\\n\\nIn the final analysis, the Democrat\\u2019s groundless assertion that Trump supporters are kneejerk racists disintegrates when it is remembered that up to 10 million former Obama supporters \\u2013 many of them White \\u2013 switched allegiances to the Trump camp in the 2016 presidential election. Are we really expected to believe that all of those Americans suddenly became hardcore racists with the arrival of the evil \\u2018orange man\\u2019 and his pledge to build a wall? That sounds highly unlikely. The far more logical explanation for this massive change in political sentiment is that Trump\\u2019s plan to remedy America\\u2019s dangerously porous borders, thereby enhancing the security of all Americans, regardless of skin color, was a welcomed idea across the board.\\n\\nNevertheless, the real danger is that the Democrats, entranced by the cult of political correctness and an out-of-control cancel culture, will attempt by some extreme measures to identify and ban so-called \\u2018racist Trump supporters\\u2019 who are just regular Americans looking for a leader who will provide them with a well-guarded country that protects the rights of all its citizens regardless of skin color. Banning undesirable Trump voters from the ballet box may eventually become as easy as censoring right-leaning Twitter users.\\n\\nClearly, the Democrats learned absolutely nothing from the mistake of branding Trump supports \\u201cdeplorables\\u201d \\u2013 to quote Hillary Clinton \\u2013 and have only worsened their present position by calling these same voters, many of them former Obama supporters, \\u201cracist.\\u201d Such a gross simplification and misunderstanding of the current American political realities goes far at explaining why the Democrats stand very little chance of beating Trump at the ballot box.\", \"author\": \"Robert Bridge\", \"url\": \"https://theduran.com/racist-trump-supporters-should-lose-their-vote-says-nbc-guess-who-decides-theyre-racist/\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 08:26:28 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580045188, \"collection_utc\": 1580040749}",News,1580045188

At times of threat, the posts were manned by part-time volunteers of the ROC, who were issued with a uniform and paid a nominal fee for the time spent at their post.\\n\\nRecruitment advertisements portrayed membership of the corps as suitable for \\u201cmen and women between the ages of 16 and 60 who are looking for an interesting, worthwhile hobby\\u201d.\\n\\nEach post was equipped with bunk beds, a chemical toilet and had ration packs \\u201ccontaining biscuits. steak and kidney pudding, tea, sugar, milk, etc. which would sustain three men without contact with the outside world for three days.\\u201d\\n\\nIn the event of a nuclear attack, the monitoring post would report levels of radiation, other measurements, and readings from the \\u201cground zero indicator\\u201d.\\n\\nThis was little more than a drum lined with photographic paper which some poor soul would need to emerge from the bunker to retrieve.\\n\\nWhen developed, this provided an indication of the intensity and direction of the blast.\\n\\nWe should be eternally thankful that none of these systems and contingency plans were ever tested in anger. Following the fall of Berlin Wall and the removal of the Soviet threat, the ROC were disbanded in 1991.\\n\\nToday many ROC observation posts survive locked and forgotten in remote parts of the country.\\n\\nThe West Calder post was abandoned in 1991, and in 2005 it was still possible to climb down into the bunker and survey a scatter of papers and furniture, while a portrait of Her Majesty the Queen smiled calmly down from the wall.\\n\\nSince then, much of the spent shale has been quarried away, and for a number of years the exposed sides of the concrete room hung perilously at the edge of the bing.\\n\\nThe concrete box now sits, almost upside down, at the foot of the bing; a monument to a horror which thankfully never arrived.\", \"author\": \"reporters@dailyrecord.co.uk (Callum Carson)\", \"url\": \"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/little-known-tale-reveals-west-21345174\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 10:02:00 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580050920, \"collection_utc\": 1580041490}",News,1580050920

He would not confirm who had died until all the next of kin have been notified, he said. The L.A. County coroner\\u2019s office said Sunday night that the recovery effort is expected to take several days because of the condition of the crash site and its remote location. Officials have shut down roads leading to the site because of a throng of visitors trying to get there.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas. Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby. Responders included 56 fire personnel \\u2014 firefighters, a helicopter with paramedics, hand crews \\u2014 and sheriff\\u2019s deputies.\\n\\n\\u201cOur firefighters hiked into the accident site with their medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the stubborn fire as it included the brush fire \\u2026 and the helicopter,\\u201d Osby said during a news conference Sunday afternoon. \\u201cThe fire also included magnesium, which is very hard for firefighters to extinguish because magnesium reacts with oxygen and water.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. The FBI is also assisting in the probe, which is standard practice. The NTSB database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nThe fog was severe enough Sunday morning that the Los Angeles Police Department\\u2019s Air Support Division grounded its helicopters and didn\\u2019t fly until later in the afternoon, department spokesman Josh Rubenstein said.\\n\\n\\u201cThe weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,\\u201d Rubenstein said. The fog \\u201cwas enough that we were not flying.\\u201d LAPD\\u2019s flight minimums are 2 miles of visibility and an 800-foot cloud ceiling, he said.\\n\\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\\u2019s Department made a similar assessment about the fog and had no helicopters in the air Sunday morning \\u201cbasically because of the weather,\\u201d Villanueva said.\\n\\nKurt Deetz, a former pilot for Island Express Helicopters who used to fly Bryant in the chopper, said weather conditions were poor in Van Nuys on Sunday morning \\u2014 \\u201cnot good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nThe crash was more likely caused by bad weather than engine or mechanical issues, he said. \\u201cThe likelihood of a catastrophic twin engine failure on that aircraft \\u2014 it just doesn\\u2019t happen,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nJudging from a public record of the flight path and the wide debris field, Deetz said, it appears the helicopter was traveling very fast at the time of impact, about 160 mph. After a 40-minute flight, Deetz added, the craft would have had about 800 pounds of fuel on board. \\u201cThat\\u2019s enough to start a pretty big fire,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles County coroner\\u2019s office is working on retrieving the bodies and has not officially identified any of the victims. But Orange Coast College confirmed that baseball coach John Altobelli was among the others who died in the crash. As a mentor and coach for 27 years, he helped students earn scholarships to play at four-year colleges and treated players like family, the school said in a statement.\\n\\n\\u201cCoach Altobelli was a giant on our campus \\u2014 a beloved teacher, coach, colleague and friend. This is a tremendous loss for our campus community,\\u201d OCC President Angelica Suarez said in a statement.\\n\\nAltobelli\\u2019s wife, Keri Altobelli, and their 13-year-old daughter, Alyssa, who played on the club team with Bryant\\u2019s daughter, were also among the victims, according to his family.\\n\\nBryant was scheduled to coach Sunday in a game at his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks and was en route there when the helicopter crashed. The tournament, called the Mamba Cup, featured boys\\u2019 and girls\\u2019 travel teams of from fourth through eighth grade.\\n\\nScores of flowers, a Lakers banner and a photo of Bryant on the cover of Sports Illustrated were left at a growing memorial outside the locked front doors of the academy.\\n\\nChristina Mauser, Bryant\\u2019s top assistant coach on the travel basketball team, was also killed in the crash.\\n\\n\\u201cMy kids and I are devastated,\\u201d her husband, Matt Mauser, wrote on Facebook. \\u201cWe lost our beautiful wife and mom today in a helicopter crash.\\u201d\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene both in and out of Staples Center on Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place around noon. As word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena, crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nFans gathered across the city to mourn. Outside Staples Center and at L.A. Live, a sea of purple orchids and yellow chrysanthemums formed. Among the crowd packed along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a pattern emerged: purple and yellow and white; 24 and 8 on people\\u2019s chests; \\u201cBRYANT\\u201d emblazoned across their backs.\\n\\nAt the intersection of Hollywood and Highland in Hollywood, a dance crew asked people in the crowd to yell out where they were visiting from \\u2014 Argentina, Korea, India. \\u201cI love you, Black Mamba!\\u201d one man shouted.\\n\\nThe ones who couldn\\u2019t get to L.A. landmarks mourned online. Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city\\u2019s heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport\\u2019s pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\nBy evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.\\n\\nL.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said people have flooded into the area of the crash, some going into residential neighborhoods and trying to get to the remote hillside where the helicopter went down. He said the traffic was making it harder for investigators and emergency personnel to do their jobs.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is off limits to everybody,\\u201d he said of the crash site, noting that the Federal Aviation Administration has a 5-mile no-fly zone around it up to altitudes of 5,000 feet. \\u201cPeople, stay away.\\u201d\\n\\nTimes staff writers Paul Pringle Gale Holland, Marisa Gerber, Nathan Fenno, David Carrillo, Michael DiGiovanna, Matthew Ormsth, Priscilla Vega, Chris Erskine, Alex Wigglesworth, Broderick Turner, Cindy Carcamo and Gustavo Arellano contributed to this report.\", \"author\": \"Richard Winton, Dan Woike, Sonali Kohli, Tania Ganguli, Ben Poston\", \"url\": \"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 10:11:42 -0500\", \"published_utc\": 1580051502, \"collection_utc\": 1580171655}",News,1580051502

As word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena, crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains.

But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nFans gathered across the city to mourn. Outside Staples Center and at L.A.

Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city\\u2019s heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport\\u2019s pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia.

His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\nBy evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.\\n\\nL.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said people have flooded into the area of the crash, some going into residential neighborhoods and trying to get to the remote hillside where the helicopter went down. He said the traffic was making it harder for investigators and emergency personnel to do their jobs.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is off limits to everybody,\\u201d he said of the crash site, noting that the Federal Aviation Administration has a 5-mile no-fly zone around it up to altitudes of 5,000 feet. \\u201cPeople, stay away.\\u201d\\n\\nTimes staff writers Paul Pringle Gale Holland, Marisa Gerber, Nathan Fenno, David Carrillo, Michael DiGiovanna, Matthew Ormsth, Priscilla Vega, Chris Erskine, Alex Wigglesworth, Broderick Turner, Cindy Carcamo and Gustavo Arellano contributed to this report.\", \"author\": \"Richard Winton, Dan Woike, Sonali Kohli, Tania Ganguli, Ben Poston\", \"url\": \"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 10:11:42 -0500\", \"published_utc\": 1580051502, \"collection_utc\": 1580171655}",News,1580051502

He would not confirm who had died until all the next of kin have been notified, he said. The L.A. County coroner\\u2019s office said Sunday night that the recovery effort is expected to take several days because of the condition of the crash site and its remote location. Officials have shut down roads leading to the site because of a throng of visitors trying to get there.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas. Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby. Responders included 56 fire personnel \\u2014 firefighters, a helicopter with paramedics, hand crews \\u2014 and sheriff\\u2019s deputies.\\n\\n\\u201cOur firefighters hiked into the accident site with their medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the stubborn fire as it included the brush fire \\u2026 and the helicopter,\\u201d Osby said during a news conference Sunday afternoon. \\u201cThe fire also included magnesium, which is very hard for firefighters to extinguish because magnesium reacts with oxygen and water.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. The FBI is also assisting in the probe, which is standard practice. The NTSB database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nThe fog was severe enough Sunday morning that the Los Angeles Police Department\\u2019s Air Support Division grounded its helicopters and didn\\u2019t fly until later in the afternoon, department spokesman Josh Rubenstein said.\\n\\n\\u201cThe weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,\\u201d Rubenstein said. The fog \\u201cwas enough that we were not flying.\\u201d LAPD\\u2019s flight minimums are 2 miles of visibility and an 800-foot cloud ceiling, he said.\\n\\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\\u2019s Department made a similar assessment about the fog and had no helicopters in the air Sunday morning \\u201cbasically because of the weather,\\u201d Villanueva said.\\n\\nKurt Deetz, a former pilot for Island Express Helicopters who used to fly Bryant in the chopper, said weather conditions were poor in Van Nuys on Sunday morning \\u2014 \\u201cnot good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nThe crash was more likely caused by bad weather than engine or mechanical issues, he said. \\u201cThe likelihood of a catastrophic twin engine failure on that aircraft \\u2014 it just doesn\\u2019t happen,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nJudging from a public record of the flight path and the wide debris field, Deetz said, it appears the helicopter was traveling very fast at the time of impact, about 160 mph. After a 40-minute flight, Deetz added, the craft would have had about 800 pounds of fuel on board. \\u201cThat\\u2019s enough to start a pretty big fire,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles County coroner\\u2019s office is working on retrieving the bodies and has not officially identified any of the victims. But Orange Coast College confirmed that baseball coach John Altobelli was among the others who died in the crash. As a mentor and coach for 27 years, he helped students earn scholarships to play at four-year colleges and treated players like family, the school said in a statement.\\n\\n\\u201cCoach Altobelli was a giant on our campus \\u2014 a beloved teacher, coach, colleague and friend.

In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December.

He would not confirm who had died until all the next of kin have been notified, he said. The L.A. County coroner\\u2019s office said Sunday night that the recovery effort is expected to take several days because of the condition of the crash site and its remote location. Officials have shut down roads leading to the site because of a throng of visitors trying to get there.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas. Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby. Responders included 56 fire personnel \\u2014 firefighters, a helicopter with paramedics, hand crews \\u2014 and sheriff\\u2019s deputies.\\n\\n\\u201cOur firefighters hiked into the accident site with their medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the stubborn fire as it included the brush fire \\u2026 and the helicopter,\\u201d Osby said during a news conference Sunday afternoon. \\u201cThe fire also included magnesium, which is very hard for firefighters to extinguish because magnesium reacts with oxygen and water.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. The FBI is also assisting in the probe, which is standard practice. The NTSB database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nThe fog was severe enough Sunday morning that the Los Angeles Police Department\\u2019s Air Support Division grounded its helicopters and didn\\u2019t fly until later in the afternoon, department spokesman Josh Rubenstein said.\\n\\n\\u201cThe weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,\\u201d Rubenstein said. The fog \\u201cwas enough that we were not flying.\\u201d LAPD\\u2019s flight minimums are 2 miles of visibility and an 800-foot cloud ceiling, he said.\\n\\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\\u2019s Department made a similar assessment about the fog and had no helicopters in the air Sunday morning \\u201cbasically because of the weather,\\u201d Villanueva said.\\n\\nKurt Deetz, a former pilot for Island Express Helicopters who used to fly Bryant in the chopper, said weather conditions were poor in Van Nuys on Sunday morning \\u2014 \\u201cnot good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nThe crash was more likely caused by bad weather than engine or mechanical issues, he said. \\u201cThe likelihood of a catastrophic twin engine failure on that aircraft \\u2014 it just doesn\\u2019t happen,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nJudging from a public record of the flight path and the wide debris field, Deetz said, it appears the helicopter was traveling very fast at the time of impact, about 160 mph. After a 40-minute flight, Deetz added, the craft would have had about 800 pounds of fuel on board. \\u201cThat\\u2019s enough to start a pretty big fire,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles County coroner\\u2019s office is working on retrieving the bodies and has not officially identified any of the victims. But Orange Coast College confirmed that baseball coach John Altobelli was among the others who died in the crash. As a mentor and coach for 27 years, he helped students earn scholarships to play at four-year colleges and treated players like family, the school said in a statement.\\n\\n\\u201cCoach Altobelli was a giant on our campus \\u2014 a beloved teacher, coach, colleague and friend. This is a tremendous loss for our campus community,\\u201d OCC President Angelica Suarez said in a statement.\\n\\nAltobelli\\u2019s wife, Keri Altobelli, and their 13-year-old daughter, Alyssa, who played on the club team with Bryant\\u2019s daughter, were also among the victims, according to his family.\\n\\nBryant was scheduled to coach Sunday in a game at his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks and was en route there when the helicopter crashed. The tournament, called the Mamba Cup, featured boys\\u2019 and girls\\u2019 travel teams of from fourth through eighth grade.\\n\\nScores of flowers, a Lakers banner and a photo of Bryant on the cover of Sports Illustrated were left at a growing memorial outside the locked front doors of the academy.\\n\\nChristina Mauser, Bryant\\u2019s top assistant coach on the travel basketball team, was also killed in the crash.\\n\\n\\u201cMy kids and I are devastated,\\u201d her husband, Matt Mauser, wrote on Facebook. \\u201cWe lost our beautiful wife and mom today in a helicopter crash.\\u201d\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene both in and out of Staples Center on Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place around noon. As word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena, crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nFans gathered across the city to mourn. Outside Staples Center and at L.A. Live, a sea of purple orchids and yellow chrysanthemums formed. Among the crowd packed along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a pattern emerged: purple and yellow and white; 24 and 8 on people\\u2019s chests; \\u201cBRYANT\\u201d emblazoned across their backs.\\n\\nAt the intersection of Hollywood and Highland in Hollywood, a dance crew asked people in the crowd to yell out where they were visiting from \\u2014 Argentina, Korea, India. \\u201cI love you, Black Mamba!\\u201d one man shouted.\\n\\nThe ones who couldn\\u2019t get to L.A. landmarks mourned online. Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city\\u2019s heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport\\u2019s pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed.

Officials have shut down roads leading to the site because of a throng of visitors trying to get there.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas. Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby.

The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nThe fog was severe enough Sunday morning that the Los Angeles Police Department\\u2019s Air Support Division grounded its helicopters and didn\\u2019t fly until later in the afternoon, department spokesman Josh Rubenstein said.\\n\\n\\u201cThe weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,\\u201d Rubenstein said.

But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene both in and out of Staples Center on Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place around noon. As word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena, crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nFans gathered across the city to mourn. Outside Staples Center and at L.A. Live, a sea of purple orchids and yellow chrysanthemums formed. Among the crowd packed along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a pattern emerged: purple and yellow and white; 24 and 8 on people\\u2019s chests; \\u201cBRYANT\\u201d emblazoned across their backs.\\n\\nAt the intersection of Hollywood and Highland in Hollywood, a dance crew asked people in the crowd to yell out where they were visiting from \\u2014 Argentina, Korea, India. \\u201cI love you, Black Mamba!\\u201d one man shouted.\\n\\nThe ones who couldn\\u2019t get to L.A. landmarks mourned online. Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city\\u2019s heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport\\u2019s pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\nBy evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.\\n\\nL.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said people have flooded into the area of the crash, some going into residential neighborhoods and trying to get to the remote hillside where the helicopter went down. He said the traffic was making it harder for investigators and emergency personnel to do their jobs.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is off limits to everybody,\\u201d he said of the crash site, noting that the Federal Aviation Administration has a 5-mile no-fly zone around it up to altitudes of 5,000 feet. \\u201cPeople, stay away.\\u201d\\n\\nTimes staff writers Paul Pringle Gale Holland, Marisa Gerber, Nathan Fenno, David Carrillo, Michael DiGiovanna, Matthew Ormsth, Priscilla Vega, Chris Erskine, Alex Wigglesworth, Broderick Turner, Cindy Carcamo and Gustavo Arellano contributed to this report.\", \"author\": \"Richard Winton, Dan Woike, Sonali Kohli, Tania Ganguli, Ben Poston\", \"url\": \"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 10:11:42 -0500\", \"published_utc\": 1580051502, \"collection_utc\": 1580171655}",News,1580051502

By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nFans gathered across the city to mourn. Outside Staples Center and at L.A. Live, a sea of purple orchids and yellow chrysanthemums formed. Among the crowd packed along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a pattern emerged: purple and yellow and white; 24 and 8 on people\\u2019s chests; \\u201cBRYANT\\u201d emblazoned across their backs.\\n\\nAt the intersection of Hollywood and Highland in Hollywood, a dance crew asked people in the crowd to yell out where they were visiting from \\u2014 Argentina, Korea, India. \\u201cI love you, Black Mamba!\\u201d one man shouted.\\n\\nThe ones who couldn\\u2019t get to L.A. landmarks mourned online. Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city\\u2019s heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport\\u2019s pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\nBy evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.\\n\\nL.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said people have flooded into the area of the crash, some going into residential neighborhoods and trying to get to the remote hillside where the helicopter went down. He said the traffic was making it harder for investigators and emergency personnel to do their jobs.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is off limits to everybody,\\u201d he said of the crash site, noting that the Federal Aviation Administration has a 5-mile no-fly zone around it up to altitudes of 5,000 feet. \\u201cPeople, stay away.\\u201d\\n\\nTimes staff writers Paul Pringle Gale Holland, Marisa Gerber, Nathan Fenno, David Carrillo, Michael DiGiovanna, Matthew Ormsth, Priscilla Vega, Chris Erskine, Alex Wigglesworth, Broderick Turner, Cindy Carcamo and Gustavo Arellano contributed to this report.\", \"author\": \"Richard Winton, Dan Woike, Sonali Kohli, Tania Ganguli, Ben Poston\", \"url\": \"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 10:11:42 -0500\", \"published_utc\": 1580051502, \"collection_utc\": 1580171655}",News,1580051502

He would not confirm who had died until all the next of kin have been notified, he said. The L.A. County coroner\\u2019s office said Sunday night that the recovery effort is expected to take several days because of the condition of the crash site and its remote location. Officials have shut down roads leading to the site because of a throng of visitors trying to get there.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas. Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby. Responders included 56 fire personnel \\u2014 firefighters, a helicopter with paramedics, hand crews \\u2014 and sheriff\\u2019s deputies.\\n\\n\\u201cOur firefighters hiked into the accident site with their medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the stubborn fire as it included the brush fire \\u2026 and the helicopter,\\u201d Osby said during a news conference Sunday afternoon. \\u201cThe fire also included magnesium, which is very hard for firefighters to extinguish because magnesium reacts with oxygen and water.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. The FBI is also assisting in the probe, which is standard practice. The NTSB database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nThe fog was severe enough Sunday morning that the Los Angeles Police Department\\u2019s Air Support Division grounded its helicopters and didn\\u2019t fly until later in the afternoon, department spokesman Josh Rubenstein said.\\n\\n\\u201cThe weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,\\u201d Rubenstein said. The fog \\u201cwas enough that we were not flying.\\u201d LAPD\\u2019s flight minimums are 2 miles of visibility and an 800-foot cloud ceiling, he said.\\n\\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\\u2019s Department made a similar assessment about the fog and had no helicopters in the air Sunday morning \\u201cbasically because of the weather,\\u201d Villanueva said.\\n\\nKurt Deetz, a former pilot for Island Express Helicopters who used to fly Bryant in the chopper, said weather conditions were poor in Van Nuys on Sunday morning \\u2014 \\u201cnot good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nThe crash was more likely caused by bad weather than engine or mechanical issues, he said. \\u201cThe likelihood of a catastrophic twin engine failure on that aircraft \\u2014 it just doesn\\u2019t happen,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nJudging from a public record of the flight path and the wide debris field, Deetz said, it appears the helicopter was traveling very fast at the time of impact, about 160 mph. After a 40-minute flight, Deetz added, the craft would have had about 800 pounds of fuel on board. \\u201cThat\\u2019s enough to start a pretty big fire,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles County coroner\\u2019s office is working on retrieving the bodies and has not officially identified any of the victims. But Orange Coast College confirmed that baseball coach John Altobelli was among the others who died in the crash. As a mentor and coach for 27 years, he helped students earn scholarships to play at four-year colleges and treated players like family, the school said in a statement.\\n\\n\\u201cCoach Altobelli was a giant on our campus \\u2014 a beloved teacher, coach, colleague and friend. This is a tremendous loss for our campus community,\\u201d OCC President Angelica Suarez said in a statement.\\n\\nAltobelli\\u2019s wife, Keri Altobelli, and their 13-year-old daughter, Alyssa, who played on the club team with Bryant\\u2019s daughter, were also among the victims, according to his family.\\n\\nBryant was scheduled to coach Sunday in a game at his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks and was en route there when the helicopter crashed. The tournament, called the Mamba Cup, featured boys\\u2019 and girls\\u2019 travel teams of from fourth through eighth grade.\\n\\nScores of flowers, a Lakers banner and a photo of Bryant on the cover of Sports Illustrated were left at a growing memorial outside the locked front doors of the academy.\\n\\nChristina Mauser, Bryant\\u2019s top assistant coach on the travel basketball team, was also killed in the crash.\\n\\n\\u201cMy kids and I are devastated,\\u201d her husband, Matt Mauser, wrote on Facebook. \\u201cWe lost our beautiful wife and mom today in a helicopter crash.\\u201d\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low.

The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court.

I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring.

He would not confirm who had died until all the next of kin have been notified, he said. The L.A. County coroner\\u2019s office said Sunday night that the recovery effort is expected to take several days because of the condition of the crash site and its remote location. Officials have shut down roads leading to the site because of a throng of visitors trying to get there.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas. Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby. Responders included 56 fire personnel \\u2014 firefighters, a helicopter with paramedics, hand crews \\u2014 and sheriff\\u2019s deputies.\\n\\n\\u201cOur firefighters hiked into the accident site with their medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the stubborn fire as it included the brush fire \\u2026 and the helicopter,\\u201d Osby said during a news conference Sunday afternoon. \\u201cThe fire also included magnesium, which is very hard for firefighters to extinguish because magnesium reacts with oxygen and water.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. The FBI is also assisting in the probe, which is standard practice. The NTSB database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nThe fog was severe enough Sunday morning that the Los Angeles Police Department\\u2019s Air Support Division grounded its helicopters and didn\\u2019t fly until later in the afternoon, department spokesman Josh Rubenstein said.\\n\\n\\u201cThe weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,\\u201d Rubenstein said. The fog \\u201cwas enough that we were not flying.\\u201d LAPD\\u2019s flight minimums are 2 miles of visibility and an 800-foot cloud ceiling, he said.\\n\\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\\u2019s Department made a similar assessment about the fog and had no helicopters in the air Sunday morning \\u201cbasically because of the weather,\\u201d Villanueva said.\\n\\nKurt Deetz, a former pilot for Island Express Helicopters who used to fly Bryant in the chopper, said weather conditions were poor in Van Nuys on Sunday morning \\u2014 \\u201cnot good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nThe crash was more likely caused by bad weather than engine or mechanical issues, he said. \\u201cThe likelihood of a catastrophic twin engine failure on that aircraft \\u2014 it just doesn\\u2019t happen,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nJudging from a public record of the flight path and the wide debris field, Deetz said, it appears the helicopter was traveling very fast at the time of impact, about 160 mph. After a 40-minute flight, Deetz added, the craft would have had about 800 pounds of fuel on board. \\u201cThat\\u2019s enough to start a pretty big fire,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles County coroner\\u2019s office is working on retrieving the bodies and has not officially identified any of the victims. But Orange Coast College confirmed that baseball coach John Altobelli was among the others who died in the crash. As a mentor and coach for 27 years, he helped students earn scholarships to play at four-year colleges and treated players like family, the school said in a statement.\\n\\n\\u201cCoach Altobelli was a giant on our campus \\u2014 a beloved teacher, coach, colleague and friend. This is a tremendous loss for our campus community,\\u201d OCC President Angelica Suarez said in a statement.\\n\\nAltobelli\\u2019s wife, Keri Altobelli, and their 13-year-old daughter, Alyssa, who played on the club team with Bryant\\u2019s daughter, were also among the victims, according to his family.\\n\\nBryant was scheduled to coach Sunday in a game at his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks and was en route there when the helicopter crashed. The tournament, called the Mamba Cup, featured boys\\u2019 and girls\\u2019 travel teams of from fourth through eighth grade.\\n\\nScores of flowers, a Lakers banner and a photo of Bryant on the cover of Sports Illustrated were left at a growing memorial outside the locked front doors of the academy.\\n\\nChristina Mauser, Bryant\\u2019s top assistant coach on the travel basketball team, was also killed in the crash.\\n\\n\\u201cMy kids and I are devastated,\\u201d her husband, Matt Mauser, wrote on Facebook. \\u201cWe lost our beautiful wife and mom today in a helicopter crash.\\u201d\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene both in and out of Staples Center on Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place around noon. As word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena, crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nFans gathered across the city to mourn. Outside Staples Center and at L.A. Live, a sea of purple orchids and yellow chrysanthemums formed. Among the crowd packed along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a pattern emerged: purple and yellow and white; 24 and 8 on people\\u2019s chests; \\u201cBRYANT\\u201d emblazoned across their backs.\\n\\nAt the intersection of Hollywood and Highland in Hollywood, a dance crew asked people in the crowd to yell out where they were visiting from \\u2014 Argentina, Korea, India. \\u201cI love you, Black Mamba!\\u201d one man shouted.\\n\\nThe ones who couldn\\u2019t get to L.A. landmarks mourned online. Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city\\u2019s heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport\\u2019s pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust.

The fog \\u201cwas enough that we were not flying.\\u201d LAPD\\u2019s flight minimums are 2 miles of visibility and an 800-foot cloud ceiling, he said.\\n\\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\\u2019s Department made a similar assessment about the fog and had no helicopters in the air Sunday morning \\u201cbasically because of the weather,\\u201d Villanueva said.\\n\\nKurt Deetz, a former pilot for Island Express Helicopters who used to fly Bryant in the chopper, said weather conditions were poor in Van Nuys on Sunday morning \\u2014 \\u201cnot good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nThe crash was more likely caused by bad weather than engine or mechanical issues, he said. \\u201cThe likelihood of a catastrophic twin engine failure on that aircraft \\u2014 it just doesn\\u2019t happen,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nJudging from a public record of the flight path and the wide debris field, Deetz said, it appears the helicopter was traveling very fast at the time of impact, about 160 mph. After a 40-minute flight, Deetz added, the craft would have had about 800 pounds of fuel on board. \\u201cThat\\u2019s enough to start a pretty big fire,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles County coroner\\u2019s office is working on retrieving the bodies and has not officially identified any of the victims. But Orange Coast College confirmed that baseball coach John Altobelli was among the others who died in the crash. As a mentor and coach for 27 years, he helped students earn scholarships to play at four-year colleges and treated players like family, the school said in a statement.\\n\\n\\u201cCoach Altobelli was a giant on our campus \\u2014 a beloved teacher, coach, colleague and friend. This is a tremendous loss for our campus community,\\u201d OCC President Angelica Suarez said in a statement.\\n\\nAltobelli\\u2019s wife, Keri Altobelli, and their 13-year-old daughter, Alyssa, who played on the club team with Bryant\\u2019s daughter, were also among the victims, according to his family.\\n\\nBryant was scheduled to coach Sunday in a game at his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks and was en route there when the helicopter crashed. The tournament, called the Mamba Cup, featured boys\\u2019 and girls\\u2019 travel teams of from fourth through eighth grade.\\n\\nScores of flowers, a Lakers banner and a photo of Bryant on the cover of Sports Illustrated were left at a growing memorial outside the locked front doors of the academy.\\n\\nChristina Mauser, Bryant\\u2019s top assistant coach on the travel basketball team, was also killed in the crash.\\n\\n\\u201cMy kids and I are devastated,\\u201d her husband, Matt Mauser, wrote on Facebook. \\u201cWe lost our beautiful wife and mom today in a helicopter crash.\\u201d\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene both in and out of Staples Center on Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place around noon. As word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena, crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nFans gathered across the city to mourn. Outside Staples Center and at L.A. Live, a sea of purple orchids and yellow chrysanthemums formed. Among the crowd packed along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a pattern emerged: purple and yellow and white; 24 and 8 on people\\u2019s chests; \\u201cBRYANT\\u201d emblazoned across their backs.\\n\\nAt the intersection of Hollywood and Highland in Hollywood, a dance crew asked people in the crowd to yell out where they were visiting from \\u2014 Argentina, Korea, India. \\u201cI love you, Black Mamba!\\u201d one man shouted.\\n\\nThe ones who couldn\\u2019t get to L.A. landmarks mourned online. Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city\\u2019s heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport\\u2019s pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\nBy evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.\\n\\nL.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said people have flooded into the area of the crash, some going into residential neighborhoods and trying to get to the remote hillside where the helicopter went down. He said the traffic was making it harder for investigators and emergency personnel to do their jobs.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is off limits to everybody,\\u201d he said of the crash site, noting that the Federal Aviation Administration has a 5-mile no-fly zone around it up to altitudes of 5,000 feet. \\u201cPeople, stay away.\\u201d\\n\\nTimes staff writers Paul Pringle Gale Holland, Marisa Gerber, Nathan Fenno, David Carrillo, Michael DiGiovanna, Matthew Ormsth, Priscilla Vega, Chris Erskine, Alex Wigglesworth, Broderick Turner, Cindy Carcamo and Gustavo Arellano contributed to this report.\", \"author\": \"Richard Winton, Dan Woike, Sonali Kohli, Tania Ganguli, Ben Poston\", \"url\": \"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 10:11:42 -0500\", \"published_utc\": 1580051502, \"collection_utc\": 1580171655}",News,1580051502

He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\nBy evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.\\n\\nL.A.

He said the traffic was making it harder for investigators and emergency personnel to do their jobs.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is off limits to everybody,\\u201d he said of the crash site, noting that the Federal Aviation Administration has a 5-mile no-fly zone around it up to altitudes of 5,000 feet. \\u201cPeople, stay away.\\u201d\\n\\nTimes staff writers Paul Pringle Gale Holland, Marisa Gerber, Nathan Fenno, David Carrillo, Michael DiGiovanna, Matthew Ormsth, Priscilla Vega, Chris Erskine, Alex Wigglesworth, Broderick Turner, Cindy Carcamo and Gustavo Arellano contributed to this report.\", \"author\": \"Richard Winton, Dan Woike, Sonali Kohli, Tania Ganguli, Ben Poston\", \"url\": \"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 10:11:42 -0500\", \"published_utc\": 1580051502, \"collection_utc\": 1580171655}",News,1580051502

He would not confirm who had died until all the next of kin have been notified, he said. The L.A. County coroner\\u2019s office said Sunday night that the recovery effort is expected to take several days because of the condition of the crash site and its remote location. Officials have shut down roads leading to the site because of a throng of visitors trying to get there.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas. Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby. Responders included 56 fire personnel \\u2014 firefighters, a helicopter with paramedics, hand crews \\u2014 and sheriff\\u2019s deputies.\\n\\n\\u201cOur firefighters hiked into the accident site with their medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the stubborn fire as it included the brush fire \\u2026 and the helicopter,\\u201d Osby said during a news conference Sunday afternoon. \\u201cThe fire also included magnesium, which is very hard for firefighters to extinguish because magnesium reacts with oxygen and water.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. The FBI is also assisting in the probe, which is standard practice. The NTSB database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nThe fog was severe enough Sunday morning that the Los Angeles Police Department\\u2019s Air Support Division grounded its helicopters and didn\\u2019t fly until later in the afternoon, department spokesman Josh Rubenstein said.\\n\\n\\u201cThe weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,\\u201d Rubenstein said. The fog \\u201cwas enough that we were not flying.\\u201d LAPD\\u2019s flight minimums are 2 miles of visibility and an 800-foot cloud ceiling, he said.\\n\\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\\u2019s Department made a similar assessment about the fog and had no helicopters in the air Sunday morning \\u201cbasically because of the weather,\\u201d Villanueva said.\\n\\nKurt Deetz, a former pilot for Island Express Helicopters who used to fly Bryant in the chopper, said weather conditions were poor in Van Nuys on Sunday morning \\u2014 \\u201cnot good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nThe crash was more likely caused by bad weather than engine or mechanical issues, he said. \\u201cThe likelihood of a catastrophic twin engine failure on that aircraft \\u2014 it just doesn\\u2019t happen,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nJudging from a public record of the flight path and the wide debris field, Deetz said, it appears the helicopter was traveling very fast at the time of impact, about 160 mph. After a 40-minute flight, Deetz added, the craft would have had about 800 pounds of fuel on board. \\u201cThat\\u2019s enough to start a pretty big fire,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles County coroner\\u2019s office is working on retrieving the bodies and has not officially identified any of the victims. But Orange Coast College confirmed that baseball coach John Altobelli was among the others who died in the crash. As a mentor and coach for 27 years, he helped students earn scholarships to play at four-year colleges and treated players like family, the school said in a statement.\\n\\n\\u201cCoach Altobelli was a giant on our campus \\u2014 a beloved teacher, coach, colleague and friend. This is a tremendous loss for our campus community,\\u201d OCC President Angelica Suarez said in a statement.\\n\\nAltobelli\\u2019s wife, Keri Altobelli, and their 13-year-old daughter, Alyssa, who played on the club team with Bryant\\u2019s daughter, were also among the victims, according to his family.\\n\\nBryant was scheduled to coach Sunday in a game at his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks and was en route there when the helicopter crashed. The tournament, called the Mamba Cup, featured boys\\u2019 and girls\\u2019 travel teams of from fourth through eighth grade.\\n\\nScores of flowers, a Lakers banner and a photo of Bryant on the cover of Sports Illustrated were left at a growing memorial outside the locked front doors of the academy.\\n\\nChristina Mauser, Bryant\\u2019s top assistant coach on the travel basketball team, was also killed in the crash.\\n\\n\\u201cMy kids and I are devastated,\\u201d her husband, Matt Mauser, wrote on Facebook. \\u201cWe lost our beautiful wife and mom today in a helicopter crash.\\u201d\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene both in and out of Staples Center on Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place around noon. As word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena, crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nFans gathered across the city to mourn. Outside Staples Center and at L.A. Live, a sea of purple orchids and yellow chrysanthemums formed. Among the crowd packed along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a pattern emerged: purple and yellow and white; 24 and 8 on people\\u2019s chests; \\u201cBRYANT\\u201d emblazoned across their backs.\\n\\nAt the intersection of Hollywood and Highland in Hollywood, a dance crew asked people in the crowd to yell out where they were visiting from \\u2014 Argentina, Korea, India. \\u201cI love you, Black Mamba!\\u201d one man shouted.\\n\\nThe ones who couldn\\u2019t get to L.A. landmarks mourned online. Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city\\u2019s heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport\\u2019s pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova.

He would not confirm who had died until all the next of kin have been notified, he said. The L.A. County coroner\\u2019s office said Sunday night that the recovery effort is expected to take several days because of the condition of the crash site and its remote location. Officials have shut down roads leading to the site because of a throng of visitors trying to get there.\\n\\nThe helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76B built in 1991, departed John Wayne Airport at 9:06 a.m. Sunday, according to publicly available flight records. The chopper passed over Boyle Heights, near Dodger Stadium, and circled over Glendale during the flight.\\n\\nThe crash occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near Las Virgenes Road and Willow Glen Street in Calabasas. Authorities received a 911 call at 9:47 a.m., and firefighters arrived to find that the crash had ignited a quarter-acre brush fire in steep terrain, said L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby. Responders included 56 fire personnel \\u2014 firefighters, a helicopter with paramedics, hand crews \\u2014 and sheriff\\u2019s deputies.\\n\\n\\u201cOur firefighters hiked into the accident site with their medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the stubborn fire as it included the brush fire \\u2026 and the helicopter,\\u201d Osby said during a news conference Sunday afternoon. \\u201cThe fire also included magnesium, which is very hard for firefighters to extinguish because magnesium reacts with oxygen and water.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. The FBI is also assisting in the probe, which is standard practice. The NTSB database does not show any prior incidents or accidents for the aircraft. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California secretary of state\\u2019s business database. The helicopter\\u2019s manufacturer, Sikorsky, said in a statement Sunday that it is cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nThe fog was severe enough Sunday morning that the Los Angeles Police Department\\u2019s Air Support Division grounded its helicopters and didn\\u2019t fly until later in the afternoon, department spokesman Josh Rubenstein said.\\n\\n\\u201cThe weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,\\u201d Rubenstein said. The fog \\u201cwas enough that we were not flying.\\u201d LAPD\\u2019s flight minimums are 2 miles of visibility and an 800-foot cloud ceiling, he said.\\n\\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\\u2019s Department made a similar assessment about the fog and had no helicopters in the air Sunday morning \\u201cbasically because of the weather,\\u201d Villanueva said.\\n\\nKurt Deetz, a former pilot for Island Express Helicopters who used to fly Bryant in the chopper, said weather conditions were poor in Van Nuys on Sunday morning \\u2014 \\u201cnot good at all.\\u201d\\n\\nThe crash was more likely caused by bad weather than engine or mechanical issues, he said. \\u201cThe likelihood of a catastrophic twin engine failure on that aircraft \\u2014 it just doesn\\u2019t happen,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nJudging from a public record of the flight path and the wide debris field, Deetz said, it appears the helicopter was traveling very fast at the time of impact, about 160 mph. After a 40-minute flight, Deetz added, the craft would have had about 800 pounds of fuel on board. \\u201cThat\\u2019s enough to start a pretty big fire,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles County coroner\\u2019s office is working on retrieving the bodies and has not officially identified any of the victims. But Orange Coast College confirmed that baseball coach John Altobelli was among the others who died in the crash. As a mentor and coach for 27 years, he helped students earn scholarships to play at four-year colleges and treated players like family, the school said in a statement.\\n\\n\\u201cCoach Altobelli was a giant on our campus \\u2014 a beloved teacher, coach, colleague and friend. This is a tremendous loss for our campus community,\\u201d OCC President Angelica Suarez said in a statement.\\n\\nAltobelli\\u2019s wife, Keri Altobelli, and their 13-year-old daughter, Alyssa, who played on the club team with Bryant\\u2019s daughter, were also among the victims, according to his family.\\n\\nBryant was scheduled to coach Sunday in a game at his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks and was en route there when the helicopter crashed. The tournament, called the Mamba Cup, featured boys\\u2019 and girls\\u2019 travel teams of from fourth through eighth grade.\\n\\nScores of flowers, a Lakers banner and a photo of Bryant on the cover of Sports Illustrated were left at a growing memorial outside the locked front doors of the academy.\\n\\nChristina Mauser, Bryant\\u2019s top assistant coach on the travel basketball team, was also killed in the crash.\\n\\n\\u201cMy kids and I are devastated,\\u201d her husband, Matt Mauser, wrote on Facebook. \\u201cWe lost our beautiful wife and mom today in a helicopter crash.\\u201d\\n\\nJerry Kocharian was standing outside the Church in the Canyon drinking coffee when he heard a helicopter that was flying unusually low and struggling.\\n\\n\\u201cIt [didn\\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy,\\u201d Kocharian said. The helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and then there was a boom.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a big fireball,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo one could survive that.\\u201d\\n\\nAcross the country Sunday, public figures, former teammates and fans alike mourned the basketball star.\\n\\n\\u201cParticularly when he was young, to be a part of his life and to watch his career grow, watch him grow, this is one of the most tragic days of my life,\\u201d said fellow Lakers legend Jerry West, 81.\\n\\nWest was the general manager for the Lakers in 1996 and maneuvered Bryant\\u2019s immediate trade to the Lakers when he was drafted.\\n\\n\\u201cI know somewhere along the way I guess I\\u2019ll come to grips with it. But now I have all these different emotions regarding him. The things I watched him do on the basketball court, but more importantly \\u2026 he was making a difference off the court. It\\u2019s so unexplainable. This is going to take a long time for me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\\u201d former President Obama tweeted. \\u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was a sad and surreal scene both in and out of Staples Center on Sunday, where a dress rehearsal for the Grammy Awards was taking place around noon. As word of Bryant\\u2019s death swept through the arena, crews worked quickly to move Bryant\\u2019s rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains. By 1 p.m., the switch had been made. No. 8 and No. 24 were side by side, illuminated by floodlights.\\n\\nNews of the crash dominated the rehearsal. Ariana Grande had just finished a lavish performance, and Billie Eilish was about to perform an acoustic song with her brother. But all eyes were on the jerseys at the other end of the floor, as staff and observers watched in disbelief.\\n\\nFans gathered across the city to mourn. Outside Staples Center and at L.A. Live, a sea of purple orchids and yellow chrysanthemums formed. Among the crowd packed along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a pattern emerged: purple and yellow and white; 24 and 8 on people\\u2019s chests; \\u201cBRYANT\\u201d emblazoned across their backs.\\n\\nAt the intersection of Hollywood and Highland in Hollywood, a dance crew asked people in the crowd to yell out where they were visiting from \\u2014 Argentina, Korea, India. \\u201cI love you, Black Mamba!\\u201d one man shouted.\\n\\nThe ones who couldn\\u2019t get to L.A. landmarks mourned online. Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.\\n\\nOn Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city\\u2019s heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport\\u2019s pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.\\n\\nWithin half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\u201c said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant\\u2019s death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\u201cWe knew right away people would be coming.\\u201d\\n\\nMinutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.\\n\\nAt the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\u201creally sad,\\u201d said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn\\u2019t come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\n\\n\\u201cHe liked the carnitas and flan,\\u201d Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\u201cHe loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He\\u2019d tell us, \\u2018Don\\u2019t treat me like a star; I\\u2019m just a customer here.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nBryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and \\u201980s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.\\n\\nBryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.\\n\\nBryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant\\u2019s rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.\\n\\nThe 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.\\n\\nBryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.\\n\\nBryant and leading scorer Shaquille O\\u2019Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game\\u2019s top player.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no words to express the pain I\\u2019m going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother,\\u201d O\\u2019Neal tweeted Sunday. \\u201cI love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite coming together to win some of the most closely fought playoff series in Lakers history, friction started to develop between Bryant and O\\u2019Neal. Tension between the two stars continued to build during the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons as the Lakers failed to capitalize on their status as top contenders for the NBA title. Making matters worse, Bryant was arrested in July 2003 on allegations of sexual assault.\\n\\nThe charges were eventually dropped, but Bryant\\u2019s reputation took a hit and he settled a civil lawsuit with the accuser. In exchange for not testifying in the criminal case, the accuser negotiated an apology letter from Bryant that read, in part, \\u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual \\u2026 I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O\\u2019Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson\\u2019s coaching contract was not renewed. As the team\\u2019s undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.\\n\\nBryant summed up the tensions between him and O\\u2019Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\u201cWe\\u2019re great as individuals, but \\u2026 it\\u2019s probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.\\n\\nHis biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.\\n\\nLaker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\u201cIt is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHe was an incredible athlete and a leader in a lot of ways. He inspired a whole generation of young athletes. He was one of the first ones to leave high school and come into the NBA and do so well, dominating the game and becoming one of the best scorers that the Los Angeles Lakers has ever seen,\\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\\n\\n\\u201cHe is the No. 1 player in the league, by far,\\u201d Washington guard Gilbert Arenas said in 2006. \\u201cWith a player like him, he just wants that challenge. He\\u2019s just that fierce competitor. He doesn\\u2019t want to get out-showed. He\\u2019s the one who everybody\\u2019s afraid of.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\u201cI would like to be traded,\\u201d Bryant said during a radio interview. \\u201cTough as it is to come to that conclusion, there\\u2019s no other alternative. It\\u2019s rough, man, but I don\\u2019t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don\\u2019t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\u201d\\n\\nBryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol\\u2019s arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals. Later that year, Bryant went on to win a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.\\n\\nWith Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.\\n\\nOngoing soreness in Bryant\\u2019s knee and ankle coupled with the team\\u2019s heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers\\u2019 championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title. Bryant also became the youngest player in NBA history to amass 27,000 career points.\\n\\nBryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.\\n\\nFollowing the team\\u2019s acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant\\u2019s season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.\\n\\nBryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.\\n\\nHe retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn 2018, he won an Oscar along with director Glen Keane for the animated short film \\u201cDear Basketball.\\u201d\\n\\nJust Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA\\u2019s all-time scoring list.\\n\\nAllen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.\\n\\nBy evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.\\n\\nL.A.

So the commitment that he had was incredible and there was no surprise that he won so much in the game.\\\"\\n\\nWatson, just 26 next month has already won two Six Nations - including the 2016 Grand Slam.\\n\\nAnd he is showing the same level of devotion to get ready for his sixth Championships as his American idol Rice.\\n\\nAfter last year's World Cup defeat to South Africa Watson wasn't going to stew and develop a Japan hangover heading into 2020.\\n\\nHe said: \\\"We landed back form the World Cup on the Tuesday, I went into the club on the Wednesday, met the coaches, had about eight days off then I started getting frustrated.\\n\\n\\\"The level of fitness you get to when you are away with England is what helps you perform like an international when you go back to your club.\\n\\n\\\"So I didn't want to let that all go to waste.\\\"\\n\\nBut the Bath ace isn't on any kind of revenge mission this Six Nations, either.\\n\\nHe said: \\\"I'm not too concerned about trying to serve up redemption or anything like that.\\n\\n\\\"I was very happy to be part of that World Cup squad, but I wanted to be part of a squad that did something special in Japan.\\n\\n\\\"So when you fail to do that on the pitch, it is disappointing - and I don't think that will ever change for us.\\n\\n\\\"I don't think I will ever be buzzing about the fact that we got to the World Cup final because of the result.\\n\\n\\\"But in terms of the feeling we had - being together for such a long time - I think we all really enjoyed it and the journey that we went on.\\\"\\n\\nWatson even plans to bring a touch of Japan to his Somerset pad.\\n\\nBecause during his time in the orient, Watson became a Bath boy in more ways than one.\\n\\nAlong with teammates Sinckler and Willi Heinz, the trio would take daily trips to the Japanese naked baths - or onsens.\\n\\nAnd his love-affair for the boiling hot tubs continues as he has grand designs to build two giant baths in his back garden - a hot one that will be about 45 degrees and a cold one at around 6 degrees.\\n\\nWatson, a Land Rover ambassador, added: \\\"I have never used anything as good to help me recover.\\n\\n\\\"It's not going to be exactly like the onsens we had in Japan, but I have a guy coming to check that my terrace can support them.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know the science behind it or how it works, but I just know my body felt five times better after an onsen.\\n\\n\\\"Myself, Sincks and Willi Heinz probably spent more than an hour in them every day - rotating between the hot and cold ones.\\n\\n\\\"We would talk about everything - from rugby, to our families and any old rubbish.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't know Willi before the World Cup either and I didn't expect to build up such a special relationship with him either.\\n\\n\\\"I don't think my missus will use them at home, but I know the heating bills will be totally worth it.\\n\\n\\\"And when I get them done, Kyle and Willi can come round whenever they want, I would love that.\\\"\\n\\nWatson also might well be called upon as the England full-back for the Six Nations.\\n\\nHe was being put through his paces yesterday by coach Neil Craig in training out in Portugal - catching high balls and passing off his left hand.\\n\\nBut bad news for England yesterday came with Joe Launchbury being ruled out of their Six Nations opener.\\n\\nThe Wasps second-row has a knee injury and will not be fit until their second game away to Scotland.\\n\\nAnthony Watson is a Land Rover ambassador.

It was also published in Saturday's print edition. This post will highlight a few of the responses.\\n\\nFirst, Ross Douthat wrote an op-ed, titled \\\"Trump's Best Defense It's that he wants to be L.B.J., not Mussolini. (But that's still a problem.)\\\"\\n\\nIn a Times op-ed this week, the Josh Blackman of the South Texas College of Law Houston argued that this narrowing of the impeachment power reflects the difficulty of defining when politicized machinations shade into the abuse of power. Allowing that Trump is particularly crude about it, all presidents conflate their own political self-interest with the national interest \\u2014 and so deciding when a president crosses the line and betrays his office is almost always a task best left up to the voters. Both the strengths and limits of Blackman's argument are distilled in one of his historical examples: Lyndon Johnson's appointment of Supreme Court Justice Tom C. Clark's son Ramsey Clark as attorney general, part of a maneuver to induce Clark's resignation so that Johnson could then appoint the first African-American justice and consolidate African-American support. This is a useful example because it's been apparent for a while that Trump doesn't want to be an American Mussolini so much as he wants to be a less legislatively minded L.B.J. \\u2014 meaning that his conception of the presidency belongs to the middle of the 20th century, when a casual corruption was more commonplace, and presidents routinely used their powers to spy on political opponents (as L.B.J. did to Barry Goldwater) or undermine them, enable their private appetites (cough, J.F.K.) and cover up their scandals.\\n\\nSecond, Matt Ford wrote an essay for The New Republic, titled \\\"The Best Defense of Donald Trump: A conservative legal scholar presents an exculpation of the president that's worth engaging.\\\"\\n\\nBut in this late hour, an exception has arrived in the form of Josh Blackman, a South Texas College of Law Houston professor. Blackman is a conservative legal scholar who has played a notable role in the legal battles surrounding the Affordable Care Act. He does not share Trump's most extreme legal stances on impeachment. Blackman acknowledges that an impeachable offense \\\"need not be criminal,\\\" and he disagrees with Trumpworld's constant assertion that impeachment amounts to the overturning of an election. While senators may have no choice but to listen to Trump's lawyers, engaging with the strongest alternatives available is more productive for everyone else.\\n\\nMatt raises a number of important points that I hope to respond to in due course.\\n\\nThird, Jonathan Bernstein wrote an essay for Bloomberg Opinion.\\n\\nWhat of the case made by law professor Josh Blackman in the New York Times on Thursday: that presidents often pursue policies in hopes of improving their political prospects? It is true, of course, that presidents consider domestic politics, including electoral politics, in everything they do. There's nothing wrong with that. Presidents should act to increase their influence, and that includes taking actions with their professional reputation and personal popularity in mind. . . . Blackman's analysis is also wrong because it matters how a president uses policy for political advantage. Trump is accused of soliciting foreign election interference! Unlike maneuvering to get a Supreme Court justice to resign, or even deploying troops, Trump tried to get a foreign nation to influence an election. That's not just a likely violation of U.S. law; it's contrary to his oath to \\\"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\\\"\\n\\nFourth, Laura Ingraham talked about my piece on her Fox News show:\\n\\nFifth, Ben Shapiro discussed my piece on his podcast. (Many, many law students in particular listen to Shapiro.)\\n\\nFinally, Fox News analyst Gregg Jarrett flagged my article on Fox News's website, as well as his own blog.\\n\\nIn an excellent opinion column in The New York Times, Constitutional Law Professor Josh Blackman reiterated the Lincoln example and also cited the actions of President Lyndon Johnson in 1967 when he maneuvered to appoint Thurgood Marshall as the first African-American justice to the U.S. Supreme Court. This advanced civil rights enormously, while also burnishing Johnson's political standing. As Blackman explained: \\\"Politicians routinely promote their understanding of the general welfare, while, in the back of their minds, considering how those actions will affect their popularity. There is nothing corrupt about acting based on such competing and overlapping concerns. Yet the impeachment trial threatens to transform this well-understood aspect of politics into an impeachable offense.\\\"\\n\\nAnd then President Trump retweeted Jarrett\\u2013the closest I've gotten (so far at least) to a presidential tweet.\\n\\nOn Friday morning, I noted that I would try to avoid checking my Twitter mentions. So far, so good. I think my new policy will be to post onto Twitter, but not check how people react. If there is something important you want to tell me, email me, don't @ me.

Thousands of years of snow have compressed into thick slabs of ice. The resulting ice cores can be more than 3km long and extend back a staggering 800,000 years.\\n\\nScientists use the chemistry of the water molecules in the ice layers to see how the temperature has varied through the millennia. These ice layers also trap tiny bubbles from the ancient atmosphere, allowing us to measure prehistoric CO\\u2082 levels directly.\\n\\nThe ice cores reveal an incredibly tight connection between temperature and greenhouse gas levels through the ice age cycles, thus proving the concepts put forward by Arrhenius more than a century ago.\\n\\nIn previous warm periods, it was not a CO\\u2082 spike that kickstarted the warming, but small and predictable wobbles in Earth\\u2019s rotation and orbit around the Sun. CO\\u2082 played a big role as a natural amplifier of the small climate shifts initiated by these wobbles. As the planet began to cool, more CO\\u2082 dissolved into the oceans, reducing the greenhouse effect and causing more cooling. Similarly, CO\\u2082 was released from the oceans to the atmosphere when the planet warmed, driving further warming.\\n\\nBut things are very different this time around. Humans are responsible for adding huge quantities of extra CO\\u2082 to the atmosphere \\u2013 and fast.\\n\\nThe speed at which CO\\u2082 is rising has no comparison in the recorded past. The fastest natural shifts out of ice ages saw CO\\u2082 levels increase by around 35 parts per million (ppm) in 1,000 years. It might be hard to believe, but humans have emitted the equivalent amount in just the last 17 years.\\n\\nBefore the industrial revolution, the natural level of atmospheric CO\\u2082 during warm interglacials was around 280 ppm. The frigid ice ages, which caused kilometre-thick ice sheets to build up over much of North America and Eurasia, had CO\\u2082 levels of around 180 ppm.\\n\\nBurning fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas, takes ancient carbon that was locked within the Earth and puts it into the atmosphere as CO\\u2082. Since the industrial revolution humans have burned an enormous amount of fossil fuel, causing atmospheric CO\\u2082 and other greenhouse gases to skyrocket.\\n\\nIn mid-2017, atmospheric CO\\u2082 now stands at 409 ppm.

Since the beginning of the year, the American side has moved to the tactics of blocking the movements of Russian troops on the strategically important M4 highway (Aleppo \\u2013 Rakka \\u2013 Hasake), demonstrating with all its appearance that the United States is still too early to write off at the Syrian military-political theater. Russia responds with a consistent strengthening of its position in the north-east of the SAR, where more recently, overseas \\u201cpartners\\u201d reigned supreme.\\n\\nThe competitive approach of Russia and the United States in Syria began in the skies of an Arab country, to this day moving into the ground phase. A hotline between the military of the two world powers was established with the aim of eliminating incidents in the airspace. It still operates with varying success, but on land the interaction to avoid collisions was clearly not set. The Pentagon followed agreements on the aerial component of deconfliction very selectively. There are several cases where the US Air Force operations in the Syrian sky, which affected the interests of Russia, its military group in the SAR was not made known. The Americans kept their hands free in the Syrian sky right up to the climax of the \\u201clead\\u201d of their Russian colleagues in October last year,Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi . The hunt for him was conducted by the VKS, as well as the Special Operations Forces of the RF Armed Forces. Having \\u201clost\\u201d the leader of the Ishilovites to the Americans, the Russian military immediately \\u201crecouped\\u201d on the ground. Moreover, they succeeded with the direct participation of Turkey \\u2013 the so-called US ally in NATO.\\n\\nAnkara puzzled Washington with the launch of Operation Source of Peace in northeast Syria against American wards in the face of the Kurdish People\\u2019s Self-Defense Forces (YPG). It was so perplexing that before the invasion of the Turkish army on October 9, Donald Trump gave the order to withdraw all American troops from the north-east of the Arab Republic. But then he changed his mind and returned a part of the contingent retiring to neighboring Iraq.\\n\\nIt turned out to be a very paradoxical situation, which, as we can safely assume, to the current stage led the Americans to use the tactics of ground blocking of the Russian military. The fact is that the Turkish \\u201cSource of Peace\\u201d was stopped precisely by the Americans after eight days from the start of the operation \\u2013 October 17. On that day, a second person arrived at Ankara with a special mission in the White House \\u2013 Vice President Michael Pence . The fighting in Syria was essentially stopped by the Americans, but the Russian side took advantage of the pause of the \\u201cSource of Peace\\u201d. On October 22, the head of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Sochi to negotiate with Vladimir Putin and agreed to sign a memorandum on northeast Syria.\\n\\nAccording to the agreement, Russia undertook to ensure the withdrawal of Kurdish YPGs from the Turkish \\u201csecurity zone\\u201d \\u2013 a 120-kilometer-long and 30-kilometer-deep section of the territory between the Syrian cities of Tel Abyad (Rakka province) and Ras al-Ain (Hasake ave. ) Another point of the Russian-Turkish agreement was the deployment of joint patrols on the territory \\u201ccleared\\u201d of Kurds to the west and east of the \\u201csecurity zone\\u201d. It so happened that Moscow took on the mission that Washington had successfully failed at one time, for Ankara was pushing for Washington to withdraw the Kurdish militia from the Syrian regions bordering with Turkey. Moreover, a joint patrol mechanism was launched, which meant a very simple thing \\u2013 Turkey actually brought Russia by hand to that part of Syria.\\n\\nResentment against the NATO ally and anger at a potential Russian enemy, the US military began to take out the same blocking of roads. Yielding to emotions, the Americans hastily left several bases and strongholds in the north and east of Syria in the first half of October. The resulting \\u201cvacuum\\u201d filled the Russian command. Closer to the Syrian-Iraqi border, tactical aircraft of the Russian Air Force, units of the army special forces and military police were deployed. In the Arab media, there were even reports about the deployment by Russia near Iraq of several batteries of anti-aircraft missile systems (SAM) S-400, allegedly deployed from the Khmeimim air base in Syrian Latakia.\\n\\nWhether the \\u201cvacuum\\u201d was created due to the feverish movement of the Americans across the border of the two Arab countries, including the new deployment of the S-400 air defense system, seems dubious. But full of publications about the Russian rush to the east of Syria, to the places of the former US-based, the Arab press is pretty annoyed with the American warriors. And they answered in a peculiar way, having transformed for a while from the Marines into a harsh \\u201croad patrol service\\u201d along the M4 highway.\\n\\nRecall that the US military since the beginning of the year has shown great aggressiveness towards the Russian presence in northeastern Syria. So, on January 21, they again blocked the movement of two Russian military convoys to checkpoints under the control of government forces in the Arab Republic. According to local military sources, the first Russian convoy was blocked by the Americans at a fork in the village of Tel Baidar, located in the northern part of Hasak province, near the city of Kamyshly (the capital of the Syrian Kurdistan, which was removed from the framework of the Sochi memorandum of October 22). The second Russian convoy was blocked by a division of the US Armed Forces near the city of Malikiya in the same province.\\n\\nSince the beginning of this year, the US military has become increasingly hostile to Russian and Syrian \\u201ccolleagues\\u201d in the north-eastern part of the SAR, Arab media say. The epicenter of it all is the M4 highway. The reason why the US impedes the movement of the Russian and Syrian military is not officially explained by the Pentagon. However , veiled signals from the US Department of Defense have previously appeared in the American media that, in this way, \\u201cRussian capture of oil fields in northeast Syria\\u201d is being prevented.\\n\\nOn January 15, a Russian military convoy was stopped on its way to one of the oil fields in the Rumeilan region, where the US air base is located. A Russian convoy of 60 vehicles advanced from the base in the Tel Tamra area. The task of the military of the Russian Federation included the creation of a checkpoint in this region of Syria.\\n\\nUS Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced October 21 last year that the Donald Trump administration would leave part of the US military in the oil field in eastern Syria, where the Kurdish \\u201cSyrian Democratic Forces\\u201d are located. The Russian Ministry of Defense issued a statement in which it indicated that the United States is engaged in \\u201crobbery on a state scale\\u201d in Syria, carrying out industrial mining in illegally seized areas of the country. This is evidenced by published satellite images of the Russian Ministry of Defense, which depicts the process of oil extraction by the Americans on Syrian territory and its subsequent export. As recalled by the military department, Syrian oil, both before and after the victory over the IS in Zaevfraty, was \\u201cactively extracted by the reliable guard of the US military.\\u201d\\n\\nIt is hard to say how long the lawlessness of the American DPS in Syria will last. There is a noteworthy assumption that the Americans will quickly \\u201ctire\\u201d of obstructing the Russian military on Syrian roads and will move on to the old and relatively effective tactic of \\u201cdeterring Russians\\u201d. This is a demonstration of even greater freedom of hands in the sky of the SAR, with a hint of a possible rejection of the airborne component of deconfliction, if the Russian military continues to squeeze the \\u201cpartners\\u201d in Zaevfrati, systematically narrowing their operational space on the ground. Therefore, one should most seriously prepare for the provocations of the US Air Force in the form of \\u201caccidental strikes\\u201d on the Syrian government forces, which could also hurt Russian troops. Good, Americans for such provocations have an \\u201calibi\\u201d in the form of a \\u201cterrorist target\\u201d they have chosen everywhere in the Middle East \\u2014 the Iranian special forces \\u201cKods\\u201d as part of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). There are not so many Iranians in northeast Syria, but this may not particularly concern Americans. That\\u2019s the \\u201caccident\\u201d when you allegedly aim at one, but you fall into another. In the one who was the real goal.\\n\\n* U.S. President Donald Trump first gave the command in December 2018 to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria. But then he decided to leave a \\u201climited contingent\\u201d of 400 US soldiers and officers (at the end of last year, about 2,200 US troops were in the SAR). In October, Trump again ordered the complete withdrawal of troops from northeastern Syria (about 1 thousand US troops) before Turkey launched Operation Source of Peace against Kurdish militias in this part of the Arab Republic. However, then the White House and the Pentagon again outplayed their previous plans, saying they were now ready to leave 500 to 600 US troops to protect its oil fields from IS fighters.\", \"author\": \"Guest Author\", \"url\": \"https://www.fort-russ.com/2020/01/syria-russian-us-forces-close-to-open-conflict-in-depth/\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 16:22:05 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580073725, \"collection_utc\": 1580083465}",News,1580073725

On that day, a second person arrived at Ankara with a special mission in the White House \\u2013 Vice President Michael Pence . The fighting in Syria was essentially stopped by the Americans, but the Russian side took advantage of the pause of the \\u201cSource of Peace\\u201d. On October 22, the head of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Sochi to negotiate with Vladimir Putin and agreed to sign a memorandum on northeast Syria.\\n\\nAccording to the agreement, Russia undertook to ensure the withdrawal of Kurdish YPGs from the Turkish \\u201csecurity zone\\u201d \\u2013 a 120-kilometer-long and 30-kilometer-deep section of the territory between the Syrian cities of Tel Abyad (Rakka province) and Ras al-Ain (Hasake ave. ) Another point of the Russian-Turkish agreement was the deployment of joint patrols on the territory \\u201ccleared\\u201d of Kurds to the west and east of the \\u201csecurity zone\\u201d. It so happened that Moscow took on the mission that Washington had successfully failed at one time, for Ankara was pushing for Washington to withdraw the Kurdish militia from the Syrian regions bordering with Turkey. Moreover, a joint patrol mechanism was launched, which meant a very simple thing \\u2013 Turkey actually brought Russia by hand to that part of Syria.\\n\\nResentment against the NATO ally and anger at a potential Russian enemy, the US military began to take out the same blocking of roads. Yielding to emotions, the Americans hastily left several bases and strongholds in the north and east of Syria in the first half of October. The resulting \\u201cvacuum\\u201d filled the Russian command. Closer to the Syrian-Iraqi border, tactical aircraft of the Russian Air Force, units of the army special forces and military police were deployed. In the Arab media, there were even reports about the deployment by Russia near Iraq of several batteries of anti-aircraft missile systems (SAM) S-400, allegedly deployed from the Khmeimim air base in Syrian Latakia.\\n\\nWhether the \\u201cvacuum\\u201d was created due to the feverish movement of the Americans across the border of the two Arab countries, including the new deployment of the S-400 air defense system, seems dubious.

So, on January 21, they again blocked the movement of two Russian military convoys to checkpoints under the control of government forces in the Arab Republic. According to local military sources, the first Russian convoy was blocked by the Americans at a fork in the village of Tel Baidar, located in the northern part of Hasak province, near the city of Kamyshly (the capital of the Syrian Kurdistan, which was removed from the framework of the Sochi memorandum of October 22). The second Russian convoy was blocked by a division of the US Armed Forces near the city of Malikiya in the same province.\\n\\nSince the beginning of this year, the US military has become increasingly hostile to Russian and Syrian \\u201ccolleagues\\u201d in the north-eastern part of the SAR, Arab media say. The epicenter of it all is the M4 highway. The reason why the US impedes the movement of the Russian and Syrian military is not officially explained by the Pentagon. However , veiled signals from the US Department of Defense have previously appeared in the American media that, in this way, \\u201cRussian capture of oil fields in northeast Syria\\u201d is being prevented.\\n\\nOn January 15, a Russian military convoy was stopped on its way to one of the oil fields in the Rumeilan region, where the US air base is located.

The fighting in Syria was essentially stopped by the Americans, but the Russian side took advantage of the pause of the \\u201cSource of Peace\\u201d. On October 22, the head of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Sochi to negotiate with Vladimir Putin and agreed to sign a memorandum on northeast Syria.\\n\\nAccording to the agreement, Russia undertook to ensure the withdrawal of Kurdish YPGs from the Turkish \\u201csecurity zone\\u201d \\u2013 a 120-kilometer-long and 30-kilometer-deep section of the territory between the Syrian cities of Tel Abyad (Rakka province) and Ras al-Ain (Hasake ave. ) Another point of the Russian-Turkish agreement was the deployment of joint patrols on the territory \\u201ccleared\\u201d of Kurds to the west and east of the \\u201csecurity zone\\u201d. It so happened that Moscow took on the mission that Washington had successfully failed at one time, for Ankara was pushing for Washington to withdraw the Kurdish militia from the Syrian regions bordering with Turkey. Moreover, a joint patrol mechanism was launched, which meant a very simple thing \\u2013 Turkey actually brought Russia by hand to that part of Syria.\\n\\nResentment against the NATO ally and anger at a potential Russian enemy, the US military began to take out the same blocking of roads. Yielding to emotions, the Americans hastily left several bases and strongholds in the north and east of Syria in the first half of October. The resulting \\u201cvacuum\\u201d filled the Russian command. Closer to the Syrian-Iraqi border, tactical aircraft of the Russian Air Force, units of the army special forces and military police were deployed. In the Arab media, there were even reports about the deployment by Russia near Iraq of several batteries of anti-aircraft missile systems (SAM) S-400, allegedly deployed from the Khmeimim air base in Syrian Latakia.\\n\\nWhether the \\u201cvacuum\\u201d was created due to the feverish movement of the Americans across the border of the two Arab countries, including the new deployment of the S-400 air defense system, seems dubious. But full of publications about the Russian rush to the east of Syria, to the places of the former US-based, the Arab press is pretty annoyed with the American warriors. And they answered in a peculiar way, having transformed for a while from the Marines into a harsh \\u201croad patrol service\\u201d along the M4 highway.\\n\\nRecall that the US military since the beginning of the year has shown great aggressiveness towards the Russian presence in northeastern Syria. So, on January 21, they again blocked the movement of two Russian military convoys to checkpoints under the control of government forces in the Arab Republic. According to local military sources, the first Russian convoy was blocked by the Americans at a fork in the village of Tel Baidar, located in the northern part of Hasak province, near the city of Kamyshly (the capital of the Syrian Kurdistan, which was removed from the framework of the Sochi memorandum of October 22). The second Russian convoy was blocked by a division of the US Armed Forces near the city of Malikiya in the same province.\\n\\nSince the beginning of this year, the US military has become increasingly hostile to Russian and Syrian \\u201ccolleagues\\u201d in the north-eastern part of the SAR, Arab media say. The epicenter of it all is the M4 highway. The reason why the US impedes the movement of the Russian and Syrian military is not officially explained by the Pentagon. However , veiled signals from the US Department of Defense have previously appeared in the American media that, in this way, \\u201cRussian capture of oil fields in northeast Syria\\u201d is being prevented.\\n\\nOn January 15, a Russian military convoy was stopped on its way to one of the oil fields in the Rumeilan region, where the US air base is located. A Russian convoy of 60 vehicles advanced from the base in the Tel Tamra area. The task of the military of the Russian Federation included the creation of a checkpoint in this region of Syria.\\n\\nUS Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced October 21 last year that the Donald Trump administration would leave part of the US military in the oil field in eastern Syria, where the Kurdish \\u201cSyrian Democratic Forces\\u201d are located. The Russian Ministry of Defense issued a statement in which it indicated that the United States is engaged in \\u201crobbery on a state scale\\u201d in Syria, carrying out industrial mining in illegally seized areas of the country. This is evidenced by published satellite images of the Russian Ministry of Defense, which depicts the process of oil extraction by the Americans on Syrian territory and its subsequent export. As recalled by the military department, Syrian oil, both before and after the victory over the IS in Zaevfraty, was \\u201cactively extracted by the reliable guard of the US military.\\u201d\\n\\nIt is hard to say how long the lawlessness of the American DPS in Syria will last.

It so happened that Moscow took on the mission that Washington had successfully failed at one time, for Ankara was pushing for Washington to withdraw the Kurdish militia from the Syrian regions bordering with Turkey. Moreover, a joint patrol mechanism was launched, which meant a very simple thing \\u2013 Turkey actually brought Russia by hand to that part of Syria.\\n\\nResentment against the NATO ally and anger at a potential Russian enemy, the US military began to take out the same blocking of roads. Yielding to emotions, the Americans hastily left several bases and strongholds in the north and east of Syria in the first half of October. The resulting \\u201cvacuum\\u201d filled the Russian command. Closer to the Syrian-Iraqi border, tactical aircraft of the Russian Air Force, units of the army special forces and military police were deployed. In the Arab media, there were even reports about the deployment by Russia near Iraq of several batteries of anti-aircraft missile systems (SAM) S-400, allegedly deployed from the Khmeimim air base in Syrian Latakia.\\n\\nWhether the \\u201cvacuum\\u201d was created due to the feverish movement of the Americans across the border of the two Arab countries, including the new deployment of the S-400 air defense system, seems dubious. But full of publications about the Russian rush to the east of Syria, to the places of the former US-based, the Arab press is pretty annoyed with the American warriors. And they answered in a peculiar way, having transformed for a while from the Marines into a harsh \\u201croad patrol service\\u201d along the M4 highway.\\n\\nRecall that the US military since the beginning of the year has shown great aggressiveness towards the Russian presence in northeastern Syria. So, on January 21, they again blocked the movement of two Russian military convoys to checkpoints under the control of government forces in the Arab Republic. According to local military sources, the first Russian convoy was blocked by the Americans at a fork in the village of Tel Baidar, located in the northern part of Hasak province, near the city of Kamyshly (the capital of the Syrian Kurdistan, which was removed from the framework of the Sochi memorandum of October 22). The second Russian convoy was blocked by a division of the US Armed Forces near the city of Malikiya in the same province.\\n\\nSince the beginning of this year, the US military has become increasingly hostile to Russian and Syrian \\u201ccolleagues\\u201d in the north-eastern part of the SAR, Arab media say. The epicenter of it all is the M4 highway. The reason why the US impedes the movement of the Russian and Syrian military is not officially explained by the Pentagon. However , veiled signals from the US Department of Defense have previously appeared in the American media that, in this way, \\u201cRussian capture of oil fields in northeast Syria\\u201d is being prevented.\\n\\nOn January 15, a Russian military convoy was stopped on its way to one of the oil fields in the Rumeilan region, where the US air base is located. A Russian convoy of 60 vehicles advanced from the base in the Tel Tamra area. The task of the military of the Russian Federation included the creation of a checkpoint in this region of Syria.\\n\\nUS Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced October 21 last year that the Donald Trump administration would leave part of the US military in the oil field in eastern Syria, where the Kurdish \\u201cSyrian Democratic Forces\\u201d are located. The Russian Ministry of Defense issued a statement in which it indicated that the United States is engaged in \\u201crobbery on a state scale\\u201d in Syria, carrying out industrial mining in illegally seized areas of the country. This is evidenced by published satellite images of the Russian Ministry of Defense, which depicts the process of oil extraction by the Americans on Syrian territory and its subsequent export. As recalled by the military department, Syrian oil, both before and after the victory over the IS in Zaevfraty, was \\u201cactively extracted by the reliable guard of the US military.\\u201d\\n\\nIt is hard to say how long the lawlessness of the American DPS in Syria will last. There is a noteworthy assumption that the Americans will quickly \\u201ctire\\u201d of obstructing the Russian military on Syrian roads and will move on to the old and relatively effective tactic of \\u201cdeterring Russians\\u201d. This is a demonstration of even greater freedom of hands in the sky of the SAR, with a hint of a possible rejection of the airborne component of deconfliction, if the Russian military continues to squeeze the \\u201cpartners\\u201d in Zaevfrati, systematically narrowing their operational space on the ground. Therefore, one should most seriously prepare for the provocations of the US Air Force in the form of \\u201caccidental strikes\\u201d on the Syrian government forces, which could also hurt Russian troops. Good, Americans for such provocations have an \\u201calibi\\u201d in the form of a \\u201cterrorist target\\u201d they have chosen everywhere in the Middle East \\u2014 the Iranian special forces \\u201cKods\\u201d as part of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). There are not so many Iranians in northeast Syria, but this may not particularly concern Americans. That\\u2019s the \\u201caccident\\u201d when you allegedly aim at one, but you fall into another. In the one who was the real goal.\\n\\n* U.S. President Donald Trump first gave the command in December 2018 to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria. But then he decided to leave a \\u201climited contingent\\u201d of 400 US soldiers and officers (at the end of last year, about 2,200 US troops were in the SAR). In October, Trump again ordered the complete withdrawal of troops from northeastern Syria (about 1 thousand US troops) before Turkey launched Operation Source of Peace against Kurdish militias in this part of the Arab Republic. However, then the White House and the Pentagon again outplayed their previous plans, saying they were now ready to leave 500 to 600 US troops to protect its oil fields from IS fighters.\", \"author\": \"Guest Author\", \"url\": \"https://www.fort-russ.com/2020/01/syria-russian-us-forces-close-to-open-conflict-in-depth/\", \"published\": \"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 16:22:05 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580073725, \"collection_utc\": 1580083465}",News,1580073725
