I always imagined it'd be a warm, earthy smoke flavor that tastes like a fire place smells. Maybe hints of grassy notes and rainbows and happiness. Boy was I wrong, so very very wrong. My father and I tried to figure it out and to us it tastes like how gear oil smells. Like a machine shop industrial strength lubricant. But a nice machine shop with big shiny machines doing very precise work. But I love the taste. I couldn't put it down I had to keep experiencing it all the way to the end of the bottle. I killed the whole thing in a week (with a little tiny bit of help from friends)  and it was mesmerizing all the way down. It was very polarizing among my friends and some people found wildly different things to compare it to like bandaids or a hospital. Another said it tasted like moss mixed with diesel smoke. What have your experiences been with it? For some reason it's oddly nostalgic to drink even if I've never had it before. If you've never experienced peat before scotch what was your reaction?
