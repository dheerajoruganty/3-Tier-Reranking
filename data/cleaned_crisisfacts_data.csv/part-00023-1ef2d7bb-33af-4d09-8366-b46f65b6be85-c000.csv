That\\u2019s bad for the environment.\", \"date\": \"2020-01-27\", \"source\": \"vox\", \"title\": \"Fashion has a misinformation problem. That\\u2019s bad for the environment.\", \"content\": \"Whenever a fashion brand makes a commitment to offset its carbon emissions, it needs to explain why it matters. Whenever a journalist like me writes a story about, say, activists protesting London Fashion Week, I also need to tell you why you should care and should keep reading. After all, there are so many other worthy things that demand our attention these days. So consider the following harrowing, commonly repeated facts:\\n\\u2022 Eight to 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from the fashion industry, which is more than the aviation and maritime shipping industries combined.\\n\\u2022 The fashion industry produces and sells somewhere between 80 billion and 150 billion garments a year globally.\\n\\u2022 Nearly three-fifths of all clothing produced ends up in incinerators or landfills within years of being made.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s clear that the fashion industry is a big, stinking mess. But if you take a moment to ponder these facts, you realize that something is \\u2026 off. An estimated range of 80 billion to 150 billion garments a year is ridiculously wide. The two most common estimates for fashion\\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions vary by a billion tons, a huge margin of error. And saying three-fifths of clothing will be trashed within \\u201cyears\\u201d is a meaningless statement.\\n\\nYet I pulled all of these statistics and other common facts from reputable sources: McKinsey. The United Nations. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The World Bank. International labor unions. Advocacy organizations. And these facts have been cited by publications like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.\\n\\nNot all of these highly respected experts could be wrong. Could they?\\n\\nOnly one out of the dozen or so most commonly cited facts about the fashion industry\\u2019s footprint is based on science\\n\\nIt turns out they could. Because only one out of the dozen or so most commonly cited facts about the fashion industry\\u2019s huge footprint is based on any sort of science, data collection, or peer-reviewed research. The rest are based on gut feelings, broken links, marketing, and something someone said in 2003.\\n\\nIf we\\u2019re serious about recruiting the fashion industry into the fight to save our world from burning, these bad facts do us all a disservice. They make fashion activists look silly. They allow brands to wave vaguely at reducing their impact without taking meaningful action. And they stymy the ability to implement meaningful regulation, which needs to be undergirded by solid data.\\n\\nThere are unmissable clues everywhere that something is wrong, from poisonous rivers in Bangladesh and Indonesia to old clothing littering the shores of East Africa to microplastics in our drinking water. But as long as we have only garbage information, we\\u2019ll only get garbage action from brands and governments to fix the problem.\\n\\n\\u201cWhere are the technical papers? Where are the peer-reviewed journals? Where is the serious work?\\u201d says Dr. Linda Greer, a former senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council and now a senior global fellow at the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a Chinese environmental NGO. \\u201cYou couldn\\u2019t even get a master\\u2019s degree with this, not even close.\\u201d (Sick burn from someone with a PhD in toxicology.) \\u201cAnd here we are trying to run a whole industry\\u2019s environmental footprint reduction based on this kind of stuff. It\\u2019s kind of preposterous that people put up with it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere are the technical papers? Where are the peer-reviewed journals? Where is the serious work?\\u201d\\n\\nGreer is intimately familiar with these bad facts and where they come from \\u2014 she thinks she might inadvertently be responsible for one of the most persistent. Years ago, she looked at sources of water pollution in the only province in China that had good government data, the highly industrialized Shaanxi, and found that the textile industry was the second most polluting after the chemical industry in that particular province. \\u201cI thought, okay, for my purposes of NRDC trying to get on top of polluters in China, this is fine. I can use this.\\u201d She went on to found the NRDC\\u2019s Clean by Design program, which helped increase water and energy efficiency at Chinese textile factories, partly on the basis of this transparently back-of-the-envelope calculation.\\n\\nAt some point in the next decade, the belief that globally, the fashion industry is the second most polluting industry after oil took off, much to her horror. (It continued to circulate even after I debunked it for Racked in 2017.) And better data has never emerged. \\u201cSomebody by now should have gone ahead and figured out what\\u2019s really true,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nAs the co-founder of the now-defunct ethical e-tailer Zady, Maxine B\\u00e9dat used to repeat many of these non-facts at sustainable fashion panels. After Zady shut down, she founded an organization called the New Standard Institute. Her goal is to collect all the best information about the fashion industry in one place and leverage it to pressure fashion brands to do something about their footprint. But as she and NSI research volunteers started to peel away the layers of each statistic, she realized that there was nothing at their core.\\n\\nI asked B\\u00e9dat in January if she had found any fashion facts that were true or had a reliable primary source, but she says NSI is not yet ready to go on the record endorsing anything. \\u201cI can tell you a bunch that are not true,\\u201d she says. She homes in on the stat that says that there are 60 million garment workers globally, which the advocacy organization Clean Clothes cited as from the International Labor Organization. \\u201cWe reached out to ILO, who doesn\\u2019t have a record of this information. It was also used by BetterWorks, Sustainable Brand Solidarity Center, and IndustriAll. Seventy-five million garment workers globally was also found in a Clean Clothes publication, and they cite Fashion United, but the link doesn\\u2019t mention that stat.\\u201d\\n\\nThis is what happens in the fashion sustainability space. One organization puts out a fact, and four other organizations link to it, and then nobody remembers or cares who first made the claim.\\n\\nThe statistic that 4 percent of global waste is from the fashion industry is the most well-sourced fact I\\u2019ve found, eventually leading back to a report by the UK nonprofit Waste & Resources Action Program (WRAP) on the waste associated with clothing sold in the UK, which is based on a peer-reviewed tool whose methodology is laid out in a robust technical analysis. It still may not be true, given that the global waste figure is extrapolated from UK figures and then compared to a stat from the UN, which hasn\\u2019t proved to be very reliable on fashion figures. But at least it\\u2019s transparent.\\n\\nWRAP\\u2019s transparency is in contrast to the consulting firm McKinsey, which says that between 2000 and 2014, global clothing production doubled, and the number of garments purchased each year by the average consumer increased by around 60 percent, to 100 billion garments per year. (The documentary The True Cost says we purchase 80 billion garments a year, while the World Economic Forum puts it at 150 billion.) Where did the figure of 100 billion garments come from? McKinsey would only say that it analyzed proprietary data provided by market research firms to come to their conclusions. And yet, in fashion\\u2019s desert of scientific research, a report with zero footnotes from a company that has reportedly helped Saudi Arabia silence critics and \\u2014 over objections from the World Health Organization \\u2014 brought an ethos of cost-cutting to the arena of global health is what passes for reputable information.\\n\\nThe McKinsey website also used to say that nearly three-fifths of all clothing produced ends up in incinerators or landfills within \\u201cone year\\u201d of being made but at some point changed it to the vague \\u201cwithin years.\\u201d\\n\\nAn Ellen MacArthur Foundation report says that 20 percent of global industrial water pollution is from the fashion industry, but EcoTextile News shredded this in its December issue dedicated to myth-busting, tracking the statistic back to a vague assertion by a 2012 paper that attributed it to the World Bank; the bank denied it was the origin of the fact. Also attributed to the World Bank is the fact that 80 percent of garment workers worldwide are women, but when I asked, a representative directed me to an article that says 80 percent of garment workers in Bangladesh are women and then to a conflicting World Bank report that says it\\u2019s actually 54 percent. The idea that the average American throws away 80 pounds of clothing comes from a 2014 Environmental Protection Agency report, but that data is also inaccurate: It includes textiles like carpets and mattresses and garment factory waste.\\n\\nAnd finally, one statistic you\\u2019ll see in almost every story and at every panel: the greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the global fashion industry. According to the UN, it\\u2019s 10 percent of global emissions. But according to a 2018 report by the sustainability consulting firm Quantis, it\\u2019s 8 percent.\\n\\n\\u201cLet\\u2019s talk for a moment about the Quantis report,\\u201d says Greer. \\u201cThey refused to provide anybody \\u2014 me, Climate Works Foundation that funded them, or the general public \\u2014 any of the data that went into their conclusions. If you were to try to publish that in a peer-reviewed journal, you would be rejected in 30 minutes. It should have died a quick death.\\u201d\\n\\nThe report didn\\u2019t die. It was pulled off the Quantis website for a few months, then republished without Climate Works\\u2019 name on it. And it keeps getting cited. By me, by other journalists, by panelists, by everyone. There\\u2019s just nothing else to go on.\\n\\nEven without good data, brands and countries are attempting to lessen the fashion industry\\u2019s impact. Last year, 150 companies joined a pact where they agreed to \\u201cscience-based\\u201d targets around emissions, biodiversity, and single-use plastics by 2050. It\\u2019s the latest in a long line of industry groups, agreements, conferences, promises, and \\u201csustainable\\u201d product lines. But companies still don\\u2019t know what is happening in their supply chains, and so have no baseline for what they will cut their emissions from. (According to a report by Greer\\u2019s organization, Nike is the only brand that regularly asks for emissions data from its factories in China.)\\n\\nSome of this bad data has even cynically been pressed into service to increase our consumption. \\u201cDouble sales and retention,\\u201d crows a marketing company that creates carbon emission calculators for eco brands. \\u201cBy purchasing a product, visitors fully understand their positive environmental impact!\\u201d\\n\\nBrands have also zeroed in on circular design, a utopian economy where waste materials would be recycled right back into new clothes. (Right now, we think that 99 percent of old clothing is eventually landfilled or burned. Don\\u2019t ask me to find the primary source for that.) As a result, Nordic countries \\u2014 the only governments that have committed any resources to improving the fashion industry \\u2014 are pouring money into textile R&D.

Whenever a journalist like me writes a story about, say, activists protesting London Fashion Week, I also need to tell you why you should care and should keep reading. After all, there are so many other worthy things that demand our attention these days. So consider the following harrowing, commonly repeated facts:\\n\\u2022 Eight to 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from the fashion industry, which is more than the aviation and maritime shipping industries combined.\\n\\u2022 The fashion industry produces and sells somewhere between 80 billion and 150 billion garments a year globally.\\n\\u2022 Nearly three-fifths of all clothing produced ends up in incinerators or landfills within years of being made.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s clear that the fashion industry is a big, stinking mess. But if you take a moment to ponder these facts, you realize that something is \\u2026 off. An estimated range of 80 billion to 150 billion garments a year is ridiculously wide. The two most common estimates for fashion\\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions vary by a billion tons, a huge margin of error. And saying three-fifths of clothing will be trashed within \\u201cyears\\u201d is a meaningless statement.\\n\\nYet I pulled all of these statistics and other common facts from reputable sources: McKinsey. The United Nations. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The World Bank. International labor unions. Advocacy organizations. And these facts have been cited by publications like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.\\n\\nNot all of these highly respected experts could be wrong. Could they?\\n\\nOnly one out of the dozen or so most commonly cited facts about the fashion industry\\u2019s footprint is based on science\\n\\nIt turns out they could. Because only one out of the dozen or so most commonly cited facts about the fashion industry\\u2019s huge footprint is based on any sort of science, data collection, or peer-reviewed research. The rest are based on gut feelings, broken links, marketing, and something someone said in 2003.\\n\\nIf we\\u2019re serious about recruiting the fashion industry into the fight to save our world from burning, these bad facts do us all a disservice. They make fashion activists look silly. They allow brands to wave vaguely at reducing their impact without taking meaningful action. And they stymy the ability to implement meaningful regulation, which needs to be undergirded by solid data.\\n\\nThere are unmissable clues everywhere that something is wrong, from poisonous rivers in Bangladesh and Indonesia to old clothing littering the shores of East Africa to microplastics in our drinking water. But as long as we have only garbage information, we\\u2019ll only get garbage action from brands and governments to fix the problem.\\n\\n\\u201cWhere are the technical papers? Where are the peer-reviewed journals? Where is the serious work?\\u201d says Dr. Linda Greer, a former senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council and now a senior global fellow at the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a Chinese environmental NGO. \\u201cYou couldn\\u2019t even get a master\\u2019s degree with this, not even close.\\u201d (Sick burn from someone with a PhD in toxicology.) \\u201cAnd here we are trying to run a whole industry\\u2019s environmental footprint reduction based on this kind of stuff. It\\u2019s kind of preposterous that people put up with it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere are the technical papers? Where are the peer-reviewed journals? Where is the serious work?\\u201d\\n\\nGreer is intimately familiar with these bad facts and where they come from \\u2014 she thinks she might inadvertently be responsible for one of the most persistent. Years ago, she looked at sources of water pollution in the only province in China that had good government data, the highly industrialized Shaanxi, and found that the textile industry was the second most polluting after the chemical industry in that particular province. \\u201cI thought, okay, for my purposes of NRDC trying to get on top of polluters in China, this is fine. I can use this.\\u201d She went on to found the NRDC\\u2019s Clean by Design program, which helped increase water and energy efficiency at Chinese textile factories, partly on the basis of this transparently back-of-the-envelope calculation.\\n\\nAt some point in the next decade, the belief that globally, the fashion industry is the second most polluting industry after oil took off, much to her horror. (It continued to circulate even after I debunked it for Racked in 2017.) And better data has never emerged. \\u201cSomebody by now should have gone ahead and figured out what\\u2019s really true,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nAs the co-founder of the now-defunct ethical e-tailer Zady, Maxine B\\u00e9dat used to repeat many of these non-facts at sustainable fashion panels. After Zady shut down, she founded an organization called the New Standard Institute. Her goal is to collect all the best information about the fashion industry in one place and leverage it to pressure fashion brands to do something about their footprint. But as she and NSI research volunteers started to peel away the layers of each statistic, she realized that there was nothing at their core.\\n\\nI asked B\\u00e9dat in January if she had found any fashion facts that were true or had a reliable primary source, but she says NSI is not yet ready to go on the record endorsing anything. \\u201cI can tell you a bunch that are not true,\\u201d she says. She homes in on the stat that says that there are 60 million garment workers globally, which the advocacy organization Clean Clothes cited as from the International Labor Organization. \\u201cWe reached out to ILO, who doesn\\u2019t have a record of this information. It was also used by BetterWorks, Sustainable Brand Solidarity Center, and IndustriAll. Seventy-five million garment workers globally was also found in a Clean Clothes publication, and they cite Fashion United, but the link doesn\\u2019t mention that stat.\\u201d\\n\\nThis is what happens in the fashion sustainability space. One organization puts out a fact, and four other organizations link to it, and then nobody remembers or cares who first made the claim.\\n\\nThe statistic that 4 percent of global waste is from the fashion industry is the most well-sourced fact I\\u2019ve found, eventually leading back to a report by the UK nonprofit Waste & Resources Action Program (WRAP) on the waste associated with clothing sold in the UK, which is based on a peer-reviewed tool whose methodology is laid out in a robust technical analysis. It still may not be true, given that the global waste figure is extrapolated from UK figures and then compared to a stat from the UN, which hasn\\u2019t proved to be very reliable on fashion figures. But at least it\\u2019s transparent.\\n\\nWRAP\\u2019s transparency is in contrast to the consulting firm McKinsey, which says that between 2000 and 2014, global clothing production doubled, and the number of garments purchased each year by the average consumer increased by around 60 percent, to 100 billion garments per year. (The documentary The True Cost says we purchase 80 billion garments a year, while the World Economic Forum puts it at 150 billion.) Where did the figure of 100 billion garments come from? McKinsey would only say that it analyzed proprietary data provided by market research firms to come to their conclusions. And yet, in fashion\\u2019s desert of scientific research, a report with zero footnotes from a company that has reportedly helped Saudi Arabia silence critics and \\u2014 over objections from the World Health Organization \\u2014 brought an ethos of cost-cutting to the arena of global health is what passes for reputable information.\\n\\nThe McKinsey website also used to say that nearly three-fifths of all clothing produced ends up in incinerators or landfills within \\u201cone year\\u201d of being made but at some point changed it to the vague \\u201cwithin years.\\u201d\\n\\nAn Ellen MacArthur Foundation report says that 20 percent of global industrial water pollution is from the fashion industry, but EcoTextile News shredded this in its December issue dedicated to myth-busting, tracking the statistic back to a vague assertion by a 2012 paper that attributed it to the World Bank; the bank denied it was the origin of the fact. Also attributed to the World Bank is the fact that 80 percent of garment workers worldwide are women, but when I asked, a representative directed me to an article that says 80 percent of garment workers in Bangladesh are women and then to a conflicting World Bank report that says it\\u2019s actually 54 percent. The idea that the average American throws away 80 pounds of clothing comes from a 2014 Environmental Protection Agency report, but that data is also inaccurate: It includes textiles like carpets and mattresses and garment factory waste.\\n\\nAnd finally, one statistic you\\u2019ll see in almost every story and at every panel: the greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the global fashion industry. According to the UN, it\\u2019s 10 percent of global emissions. But according to a 2018 report by the sustainability consulting firm Quantis, it\\u2019s 8 percent.\\n\\n\\u201cLet\\u2019s talk for a moment about the Quantis report,\\u201d says Greer. \\u201cThey refused to provide anybody \\u2014 me, Climate Works Foundation that funded them, or the general public \\u2014 any of the data that went into their conclusions. If you were to try to publish that in a peer-reviewed journal, you would be rejected in 30 minutes. It should have died a quick death.\\u201d\\n\\nThe report didn\\u2019t die. It was pulled off the Quantis website for a few months, then republished without Climate Works\\u2019 name on it. And it keeps getting cited. By me, by other journalists, by panelists, by everyone. There\\u2019s just nothing else to go on.\\n\\nEven without good data, brands and countries are attempting to lessen the fashion industry\\u2019s impact. Last year, 150 companies joined a pact where they agreed to \\u201cscience-based\\u201d targets around emissions, biodiversity, and single-use plastics by 2050. It\\u2019s the latest in a long line of industry groups, agreements, conferences, promises, and \\u201csustainable\\u201d product lines. But companies still don\\u2019t know what is happening in their supply chains, and so have no baseline for what they will cut their emissions from. (According to a report by Greer\\u2019s organization, Nike is the only brand that regularly asks for emissions data from its factories in China.)\\n\\nSome of this bad data has even cynically been pressed into service to increase our consumption. \\u201cDouble sales and retention,\\u201d crows a marketing company that creates carbon emission calculators for eco brands. \\u201cBy purchasing a product, visitors fully understand their positive environmental impact!\\u201d\\n\\nBrands have also zeroed in on circular design, a utopian economy where waste materials would be recycled right back into new clothes. (Right now, we think that 99 percent of old clothing is eventually landfilled or burned. Don\\u2019t ask me to find the primary source for that.) As a result, Nordic countries \\u2014 the only governments that have committed any resources to improving the fashion industry \\u2014 are pouring money into textile R&D. Sure, that will help with waste, but what if it ends up increasing fashion\\u2019s footprint in other areas?\\n\\n\\u201cIf they put out a rule that is based on ... this 20 percent stat, then it\\u2019s not going to survive a courtroom challenge\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere is the data that shows what the difference is in terms of carbon emissions, water use, toxic chemical use in a fully circular economy for the fashion industry?\\u201d Greer asks. \\u201cI\\u2019ve yet to see numbers.\\u201d She\\u2019s spent decades at the NRDC working to protect the environment from industrial pollution and knows firsthand the kind of robust research literature that has to undergird government rulemaking on corporate pollution. The false stat about how much global industrial water pollution comes from the fashion industry, for instance, is not going to cut it. \\u201cIf they put out a rule that is based on something as flip-floppy as this 20 percent stat, then it\\u2019s not going to survive a courtroom challenge,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s clear that before we do anything else \\u2014 demand legislation, invent new textiles, set targets \\u2014 we need to figure out what research we need, then ask the government and big brands to fund it.\\n\\n\\u201cWe need a landscape assessment of the data and an analysis of the gaps and inconsistencies that\\u2019s crisp,\\u201d Greer says. \\u201cAnd then a call for funding the research to fill those gaps.

As a result, Nordic countries \\u2014 the only governments that have committed any resources to improving the fashion industry \\u2014 are pouring money into textile R&D.

After Zady shut down, she founded an organization called the New Standard Institute. Her goal is to collect all the best information about the fashion industry in one place and leverage it to pressure fashion brands to do something about their footprint. But as she and NSI research volunteers started to peel away the layers of each statistic, she realized that there was nothing at their core.\\n\\nI asked B\\u00e9dat in January if she had found any fashion facts that were true or had a reliable primary source, but she says NSI is not yet ready to go on the record endorsing anything. \\u201cI can tell you a bunch that are not true,\\u201d she says. She homes in on the stat that says that there are 60 million garment workers globally, which the advocacy organization Clean Clothes cited as from the International Labor Organization. \\u201cWe reached out to ILO, who doesn\\u2019t have a record of this information.

Seventy-five million garment workers globally was also found in a Clean Clothes publication, and they cite Fashion United, but the link doesn\\u2019t mention that stat.\\u201d\\n\\nThis is what happens in the fashion sustainability space. One organization puts out a fact, and four other organizations link to it, and then nobody remembers or cares who first made the claim.\\n\\nThe statistic that 4 percent of global waste is from the fashion industry is the most well-sourced fact I\\u2019ve found, eventually leading back to a report by the UK nonprofit Waste & Resources Action Program (WRAP) on the waste associated with clothing sold in the UK, which is based on a peer-reviewed tool whose methodology is laid out in a robust technical analysis. It still may not be true, given that the global waste figure is extrapolated from UK figures and then compared to a stat from the UN, which hasn\\u2019t proved to be very reliable on fashion figures. But at least it\\u2019s transparent.\\n\\nWRAP\\u2019s transparency is in contrast to the consulting firm McKinsey, which says that between 2000 and 2014, global clothing production doubled, and the number of garments purchased each year by the average consumer increased by around 60 percent, to 100 billion garments per year. (The documentary The True Cost says we purchase 80 billion garments a year, while the World Economic Forum puts it at 150 billion.) Where did the figure of 100 billion garments come from? McKinsey would only say that it analyzed proprietary data provided by market research firms to come to their conclusions. And yet, in fashion\\u2019s desert of scientific research, a report with zero footnotes from a company that has reportedly helped Saudi Arabia silence critics and \\u2014 over objections from the World Health Organization \\u2014 brought an ethos of cost-cutting to the arena of global health is what passes for reputable information.\\n\\nThe McKinsey website also used to say that nearly three-fifths of all clothing produced ends up in incinerators or landfills within \\u201cone year\\u201d of being made but at some point changed it to the vague \\u201cwithin years.\\u201d\\n\\nAn Ellen MacArthur Foundation report says that 20 percent of global industrial water pollution is from the fashion industry, but EcoTextile News shredded this in its December issue dedicated to myth-busting, tracking the statistic back to a vague assertion by a 2012 paper that attributed it to the World Bank; the bank denied it was the origin of the fact. Also attributed to the World Bank is the fact that 80 percent of garment workers worldwide are women, but when I asked, a representative directed me to an article that says 80 percent of garment workers in Bangladesh are women and then to a conflicting World Bank report that says it\\u2019s actually 54 percent. The idea that the average American throws away 80 pounds of clothing comes from a 2014 Environmental Protection Agency report, but that data is also inaccurate: It includes textiles like carpets and mattresses and garment factory waste.\\n\\nAnd finally, one statistic you\\u2019ll see in almost every story and at every panel: the greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the global fashion industry. According to the UN, it\\u2019s 10 percent of global emissions. But according to a 2018 report by the sustainability consulting firm Quantis, it\\u2019s 8 percent.\\n\\n\\u201cLet\\u2019s talk for a moment about the Quantis report,\\u201d says Greer. \\u201cThey refused to provide anybody \\u2014 me, Climate Works Foundation that funded them, or the general public \\u2014 any of the data that went into their conclusions.

McKinsey would only say that it analyzed proprietary data provided by market research firms to come to their conclusions. And yet, in fashion\\u2019s desert of scientific research, a report with zero footnotes from a company that has reportedly helped Saudi Arabia silence critics and \\u2014 over objections from the World Health Organization \\u2014 brought an ethos of cost-cutting to the arena of global health is what passes for reputable information.\\n\\nThe McKinsey website also used to say that nearly three-fifths of all clothing produced ends up in incinerators or landfills within \\u201cone year\\u201d of being made but at some point changed it to the vague \\u201cwithin years.\\u201d\\n\\nAn Ellen MacArthur Foundation report says that 20 percent of global industrial water pollution is from the fashion industry, but EcoTextile News shredded this in its December issue dedicated to myth-busting, tracking the statistic back to a vague assertion by a 2012 paper that attributed it to the World Bank; the bank denied it was the origin of the fact. Also attributed to the World Bank is the fact that 80 percent of garment workers worldwide are women, but when I asked, a representative directed me to an article that says 80 percent of garment workers in Bangladesh are women and then to a conflicting World Bank report that says it\\u2019s actually 54 percent. The idea that the average American throws away 80 pounds of clothing comes from a 2014 Environmental Protection Agency report, but that data is also inaccurate: It includes textiles like carpets and mattresses and garment factory waste.\\n\\nAnd finally, one statistic you\\u2019ll see in almost every story and at every panel: the greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the global fashion industry. According to the UN, it\\u2019s 10 percent of global emissions. But according to a 2018 report by the sustainability consulting firm Quantis, it\\u2019s 8 percent.\\n\\n\\u201cLet\\u2019s talk for a moment about the Quantis report,\\u201d says Greer. \\u201cThey refused to provide anybody \\u2014 me, Climate Works Foundation that funded them, or the general public \\u2014 any of the data that went into their conclusions. If you were to try to publish that in a peer-reviewed journal, you would be rejected in 30 minutes. It should have died a quick death.\\u201d\\n\\nThe report didn\\u2019t die. It was pulled off the Quantis website for a few months, then republished without Climate Works\\u2019 name on it. And it keeps getting cited. By me, by other journalists, by panelists, by everyone. There\\u2019s just nothing else to go on.\\n\\nEven without good data, brands and countries are attempting to lessen the fashion industry\\u2019s impact. Last year, 150 companies joined a pact where they agreed to \\u201cscience-based\\u201d targets around emissions, biodiversity, and single-use plastics by 2050. It\\u2019s the latest in a long line of industry groups, agreements, conferences, promises, and \\u201csustainable\\u201d product lines. But companies still don\\u2019t know what is happening in their supply chains, and so have no baseline for what they will cut their emissions from. (According to a report by Greer\\u2019s organization, Nike is the only brand that regularly asks for emissions data from its factories in China.)\\n\\nSome of this bad data has even cynically been pressed into service to increase our consumption. \\u201cDouble sales and retention,\\u201d crows a marketing company that creates carbon emission calculators for eco brands. \\u201cBy purchasing a product, visitors fully understand their positive environmental impact!\\u201d\\n\\nBrands have also zeroed in on circular design, a utopian economy where waste materials would be recycled right back into new clothes. (Right now, we think that 99 percent of old clothing is eventually landfilled or burned. Don\\u2019t ask me to find the primary source for that.) As a result, Nordic countries \\u2014 the only governments that have committed any resources to improving the fashion industry \\u2014 are pouring money into textile R&D. Sure, that will help with waste, but what if it ends up increasing fashion\\u2019s footprint in other areas?\\n\\n\\u201cIf they put out a rule that is based on ... this 20 percent stat, then it\\u2019s not going to survive a courtroom challenge\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere is the data that shows what the difference is in terms of carbon emissions, water use, toxic chemical use in a fully circular economy for the fashion industry?\\u201d Greer asks. \\u201cI\\u2019ve yet to see numbers.\\u201d She\\u2019s spent decades at the NRDC working to protect the environment from industrial pollution and knows firsthand the kind of robust research literature that has to undergird government rulemaking on corporate pollution. The false stat about how much global industrial water pollution comes from the fashion industry, for instance, is not going to cut it. \\u201cIf they put out a rule that is based on something as flip-floppy as this 20 percent stat, then it\\u2019s not going to survive a courtroom challenge,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s clear that before we do anything else \\u2014 demand legislation, invent new textiles, set targets \\u2014 we need to figure out what research we need, then ask the government and big brands to fund it.\\n\\n\\u201cWe need a landscape assessment of the data and an analysis of the gaps and inconsistencies that\\u2019s crisp,\\u201d Greer says. \\u201cAnd then a call for funding the research to fill those gaps. Then we\\u2019d be making progress.\\u201d\\n\\nThat money needs to come from the government or a consortium of fashion brands, because getting good data is expensive. For example, the California nonprofit Fibershed is planning a fiber mapping project where it would go into people\\u2019s closets, look at all the tags in their clothing, weigh the clothing, and then process the data to yield high-quality research on the fiber mix in our closets. Founder Rebecca Burgess estimates that it will cost more than $100,000 just for California.\\n\\n\\u201cAll these sociological and quantitative data sets on the labor side would cost as much or more money,\\u201d Burgess says. \\u201cWe need funding for people to be on the ground to take water samples, to go into factories and count how many workers are women. Unless the public is crying for it, who is going to fund that?\\u201d\\n\\nThere is some progress. Last May, Stella McCartney and Google announced a partnership to test Google\\u2019s data-processing prowess by quantifying the impact of various types of cotton and viscose, using McCartney\\u2019s data and more data they hope to collect from researchers and brands. But the fear is that the resulting data will only be available for brands to use.\\n\\n\\u201cIf we don\\u2019t invest as an industry in this process, any company can say anything and we can\\u2019t say whether it\\u2019s meaningful\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s not enough investment in academia, but I can say there\\u2019s a lot of money in private research,\\u201d says Dr. Joanne Brasch, a lecturer at UC Davis on textile sustainability and special project manager at the nonprofit California Product Stewardship Council. She sees her students get snapped up by fashion brands at graduation, essentially privatizing the vast majority of fashion science.\\n\\nThis might be her last year at UC Davis, too. Her research funding has dried up, and UC Davis shut down the two undergraduate majors, textiles and clothing and polymer science.

So consider the following harrowing, commonly repeated facts:\\n\\u2022 Eight to 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from the fashion industry, which is more than the aviation and maritime shipping industries combined.\\n\\u2022 The fashion industry produces and sells somewhere between 80 billion and 150 billion garments a year globally.\\n\\u2022 Nearly three-fifths of all clothing produced ends up in incinerators or landfills within years of being made.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s clear that the fashion industry is a big, stinking mess. But if you take a moment to ponder these facts, you realize that something is \\u2026 off. An estimated range of 80 billion to 150 billion garments a year is ridiculously wide. The two most common estimates for fashion\\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions vary by a billion tons, a huge margin of error. And saying three-fifths of clothing will be trashed within \\u201cyears\\u201d is a meaningless statement.\\n\\nYet I pulled all of these statistics and other common facts from reputable sources: McKinsey. The United Nations. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The World Bank. International labor unions. Advocacy organizations. And these facts have been cited by publications like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.\\n\\nNot all of these highly respected experts could be wrong. Could they?\\n\\nOnly one out of the dozen or so most commonly cited facts about the fashion industry\\u2019s footprint is based on science\\n\\nIt turns out they could. Because only one out of the dozen or so most commonly cited facts about the fashion industry\\u2019s huge footprint is based on any sort of science, data collection, or peer-reviewed research. The rest are based on gut feelings, broken links, marketing, and something someone said in 2003.\\n\\nIf we\\u2019re serious about recruiting the fashion industry into the fight to save our world from burning, these bad facts do us all a disservice. They make fashion activists look silly. They allow brands to wave vaguely at reducing their impact without taking meaningful action. And they stymy the ability to implement meaningful regulation, which needs to be undergirded by solid data.\\n\\nThere are unmissable clues everywhere that something is wrong, from poisonous rivers in Bangladesh and Indonesia to old clothing littering the shores of East Africa to microplastics in our drinking water. But as long as we have only garbage information, we\\u2019ll only get garbage action from brands and governments to fix the problem.\\n\\n\\u201cWhere are the technical papers? Where are the peer-reviewed journals? Where is the serious work?\\u201d says Dr. Linda Greer, a former senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council and now a senior global fellow at the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a Chinese environmental NGO. \\u201cYou couldn\\u2019t even get a master\\u2019s degree with this, not even close.\\u201d (Sick burn from someone with a PhD in toxicology.) \\u201cAnd here we are trying to run a whole industry\\u2019s environmental footprint reduction based on this kind of stuff. It\\u2019s kind of preposterous that people put up with it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere are the technical papers? Where are the peer-reviewed journals? Where is the serious work?\\u201d\\n\\nGreer is intimately familiar with these bad facts and where they come from \\u2014 she thinks she might inadvertently be responsible for one of the most persistent. Years ago, she looked at sources of water pollution in the only province in China that had good government data, the highly industrialized Shaanxi, and found that the textile industry was the second most polluting after the chemical industry in that particular province. \\u201cI thought, okay, for my purposes of NRDC trying to get on top of polluters in China, this is fine. I can use this.\\u201d She went on to found the NRDC\\u2019s Clean by Design program, which helped increase water and energy efficiency at Chinese textile factories, partly on the basis of this transparently back-of-the-envelope calculation.\\n\\nAt some point in the next decade, the belief that globally, the fashion industry is the second most polluting industry after oil took off, much to her horror. (It continued to circulate even after I debunked it for Racked in 2017.) And better data has never emerged. \\u201cSomebody by now should have gone ahead and figured out what\\u2019s really true,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nAs the co-founder of the now-defunct ethical e-tailer Zady, Maxine B\\u00e9dat used to repeat many of these non-facts at sustainable fashion panels. After Zady shut down, she founded an organization called the New Standard Institute. Her goal is to collect all the best information about the fashion industry in one place and leverage it to pressure fashion brands to do something about their footprint. But as she and NSI research volunteers started to peel away the layers of each statistic, she realized that there was nothing at their core.\\n\\nI asked B\\u00e9dat in January if she had found any fashion facts that were true or had a reliable primary source, but she says NSI is not yet ready to go on the record endorsing anything. \\u201cI can tell you a bunch that are not true,\\u201d she says. She homes in on the stat that says that there are 60 million garment workers globally, which the advocacy organization Clean Clothes cited as from the International Labor Organization. \\u201cWe reached out to ILO, who doesn\\u2019t have a record of this information. It was also used by BetterWorks, Sustainable Brand Solidarity Center, and IndustriAll. Seventy-five million garment workers globally was also found in a Clean Clothes publication, and they cite Fashion United, but the link doesn\\u2019t mention that stat.\\u201d\\n\\nThis is what happens in the fashion sustainability space. One organization puts out a fact, and four other organizations link to it, and then nobody remembers or cares who first made the claim.\\n\\nThe statistic that 4 percent of global waste is from the fashion industry is the most well-sourced fact I\\u2019ve found, eventually leading back to a report by the UK nonprofit Waste & Resources Action Program (WRAP) on the waste associated with clothing sold in the UK, which is based on a peer-reviewed tool whose methodology is laid out in a robust technical analysis. It still may not be true, given that the global waste figure is extrapolated from UK figures and then compared to a stat from the UN, which hasn\\u2019t proved to be very reliable on fashion figures.

After Zady shut down, she founded an organization called the New Standard Institute. Her goal is to collect all the best information about the fashion industry in one place and leverage it to pressure fashion brands to do something about their footprint. But as she and NSI research volunteers started to peel away the layers of each statistic, she realized that there was nothing at their core.\\n\\nI asked B\\u00e9dat in January if she had found any fashion facts that were true or had a reliable primary source, but she says NSI is not yet ready to go on the record endorsing anything. \\u201cI can tell you a bunch that are not true,\\u201d she says. She homes in on the stat that says that there are 60 million garment workers globally, which the advocacy organization Clean Clothes cited as from the International Labor Organization. \\u201cWe reached out to ILO, who doesn\\u2019t have a record of this information. It was also used by BetterWorks, Sustainable Brand Solidarity Center, and IndustriAll. Seventy-five million garment workers globally was also found in a Clean Clothes publication, and they cite Fashion United, but the link doesn\\u2019t mention that stat.\\u201d\\n\\nThis is what happens in the fashion sustainability space. One organization puts out a fact, and four other organizations link to it, and then nobody remembers or cares who first made the claim.\\n\\nThe statistic that 4 percent of global waste is from the fashion industry is the most well-sourced fact I\\u2019ve found, eventually leading back to a report by the UK nonprofit Waste & Resources Action Program (WRAP) on the waste associated with clothing sold in the UK, which is based on a peer-reviewed tool whose methodology is laid out in a robust technical analysis. It still may not be true, given that the global waste figure is extrapolated from UK figures and then compared to a stat from the UN, which hasn\\u2019t proved to be very reliable on fashion figures. But at least it\\u2019s transparent.\\n\\nWRAP\\u2019s transparency is in contrast to the consulting firm McKinsey, which says that between 2000 and 2014, global clothing production doubled, and the number of garments purchased each year by the average consumer increased by around 60 percent, to 100 billion garments per year. (The documentary The True Cost says we purchase 80 billion garments a year, while the World Economic Forum puts it at 150 billion.) Where did the figure of 100 billion garments come from? McKinsey would only say that it analyzed proprietary data provided by market research firms to come to their conclusions. And yet, in fashion\\u2019s desert of scientific research, a report with zero footnotes from a company that has reportedly helped Saudi Arabia silence critics and \\u2014 over objections from the World Health Organization \\u2014 brought an ethos of cost-cutting to the arena of global health is what passes for reputable information.\\n\\nThe McKinsey website also used to say that nearly three-fifths of all clothing produced ends up in incinerators or landfills within \\u201cone year\\u201d of being made but at some point changed it to the vague \\u201cwithin years.\\u201d\\n\\nAn Ellen MacArthur Foundation report says that 20 percent of global industrial water pollution is from the fashion industry, but EcoTextile News shredded this in its December issue dedicated to myth-busting, tracking the statistic back to a vague assertion by a 2012 paper that attributed it to the World Bank; the bank denied it was the origin of the fact. Also attributed to the World Bank is the fact that 80 percent of garment workers worldwide are women, but when I asked, a representative directed me to an article that says 80 percent of garment workers in Bangladesh are women and then to a conflicting World Bank report that says it\\u2019s actually 54 percent. The idea that the average American throws away 80 pounds of clothing comes from a 2014 Environmental Protection Agency report, but that data is also inaccurate: It includes textiles like carpets and mattresses and garment factory waste.\\n\\nAnd finally, one statistic you\\u2019ll see in almost every story and at every panel: the greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the global fashion industry. According to the UN, it\\u2019s 10 percent of global emissions. But according to a 2018 report by the sustainability consulting firm Quantis, it\\u2019s 8 percent.\\n\\n\\u201cLet\\u2019s talk for a moment about the Quantis report,\\u201d says Greer. \\u201cThey refused to provide anybody \\u2014 me, Climate Works Foundation that funded them, or the general public \\u2014 any of the data that went into their conclusions. If you were to try to publish that in a peer-reviewed journal, you would be rejected in 30 minutes. It should have died a quick death.\\u201d\\n\\nThe report didn\\u2019t die. It was pulled off the Quantis website for a few months, then republished without Climate Works\\u2019 name on it. And it keeps getting cited. By me, by other journalists, by panelists, by everyone. There\\u2019s just nothing else to go on.\\n\\nEven without good data, brands and countries are attempting to lessen the fashion industry\\u2019s impact. Last year, 150 companies joined a pact where they agreed to \\u201cscience-based\\u201d targets around emissions, biodiversity, and single-use plastics by 2050. It\\u2019s the latest in a long line of industry groups, agreements, conferences, promises, and \\u201csustainable\\u201d product lines. But companies still don\\u2019t know what is happening in their supply chains, and so have no baseline for what they will cut their emissions from. (According to a report by Greer\\u2019s organization, Nike is the only brand that regularly asks for emissions data from its factories in China.)\\n\\nSome of this bad data has even cynically been pressed into service to increase our consumption. \\u201cDouble sales and retention,\\u201d crows a marketing company that creates carbon emission calculators for eco brands. \\u201cBy purchasing a product, visitors fully understand their positive environmental impact!\\u201d\\n\\nBrands have also zeroed in on circular design, a utopian economy where waste materials would be recycled right back into new clothes. (Right now, we think that 99 percent of old clothing is eventually landfilled or burned. Don\\u2019t ask me to find the primary source for that.) As a result, Nordic countries \\u2014 the only governments that have committed any resources to improving the fashion industry \\u2014 are pouring money into textile R&D. Sure, that will help with waste, but what if it ends up increasing fashion\\u2019s footprint in other areas?\\n\\n\\u201cIf they put out a rule that is based on ... this 20 percent stat, then it\\u2019s not going to survive a courtroom challenge\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere is the data that shows what the difference is in terms of carbon emissions, water use, toxic chemical use in a fully circular economy for the fashion industry?\\u201d Greer asks. \\u201cI\\u2019ve yet to see numbers.\\u201d She\\u2019s spent decades at the NRDC working to protect the environment from industrial pollution and knows firsthand the kind of robust research literature that has to undergird government rulemaking on corporate pollution. The false stat about how much global industrial water pollution comes from the fashion industry, for instance, is not going to cut it. \\u201cIf they put out a rule that is based on something as flip-floppy as this 20 percent stat, then it\\u2019s not going to survive a courtroom challenge,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s clear that before we do anything else \\u2014 demand legislation, invent new textiles, set targets \\u2014 we need to figure out what research we need, then ask the government and big brands to fund it.\\n\\n\\u201cWe need a landscape assessment of the data and an analysis of the gaps and inconsistencies that\\u2019s crisp,\\u201d Greer says. \\u201cAnd then a call for funding the research to fill those gaps. Then we\\u2019d be making progress.\\u201d\\n\\nThat money needs to come from the government or a consortium of fashion brands, because getting good data is expensive. For example, the California nonprofit Fibershed is planning a fiber mapping project where it would go into people\\u2019s closets, look at all the tags in their clothing, weigh the clothing, and then process the data to yield high-quality research on the fiber mix in our closets. Founder Rebecca Burgess estimates that it will cost more than $100,000 just for California.\\n\\n\\u201cAll these sociological and quantitative data sets on the labor side would cost as much or more money,\\u201d Burgess says. \\u201cWe need funding for people to be on the ground to take water samples, to go into factories and count how many workers are women. Unless the public is crying for it, who is going to fund that?\\u201d\\n\\nThere is some progress. Last May, Stella McCartney and Google announced a partnership to test Google\\u2019s data-processing prowess by quantifying the impact of various types of cotton and viscose, using McCartney\\u2019s data and more data they hope to collect from researchers and brands. But the fear is that the resulting data will only be available for brands to use.\\n\\n\\u201cIf we don\\u2019t invest as an industry in this process, any company can say anything and we can\\u2019t say whether it\\u2019s meaningful\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s not enough investment in academia, but I can say there\\u2019s a lot of money in private research,\\u201d says Dr. Joanne Brasch, a lecturer at UC Davis on textile sustainability and special project manager at the nonprofit California Product Stewardship Council. She sees her students get snapped up by fashion brands at graduation, essentially privatizing the vast majority of fashion science.\\n\\nThis might be her last year at UC Davis, too. Her research funding has dried up, and UC Davis shut down the two undergraduate majors, textiles and clothing and polymer science. Incoming graduate students interested in fashion sustainability will now have to choose either fashion design or material engineering. Students revolted and signed a resolution against the move, but it was no use. Instead of researching what fashion does to our world, they now can only study how to make more of it.\\n\\n\\u201cThis stuff isn\\u2019t rocket science,\\u201d B\\u00e9dat says. \\u201cThe industry just hasn\\u2019t invested and prioritized this information. And if we don\\u2019t invest as an industry in this process, any company can say anything and we can\\u2019t say yes or no on whether it\\u2019s a meaningful process.\\u201d\\n\\nBut despite all this, she thinks the conversation is shifting. \\u201cI am hopeful in this year and decade that we\\u2019re moving toward bringing clarity into this space.\\u201d\\n\\nSign up for The Goods\\u2019 newsletter and we\\u2019ll send you the best Goods stories exploring what we buy, why we buy it, and why it matters.\", \"author\": \"Alden Wicker\", \"url\": \"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/1/27/21080107/fashion-environment-facts-statistics-impact\", \"published\": \"2020-01-27T07:00:00-05:00\", \"published_utc\": 1580126400, \"collection_utc\": 1580127494}",News,1580126400

Where is the serious work?\\u201d says Dr. Linda Greer, a former senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council and now a senior global fellow at the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a Chinese environmental NGO. \\u201cYou couldn\\u2019t even get a master\\u2019s degree with this, not even close.\\u201d (Sick burn from someone with a PhD in toxicology.) \\u201cAnd here we are trying to run a whole industry\\u2019s environmental footprint reduction based on this kind of stuff. It\\u2019s kind of preposterous that people put up with it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere are the technical papers? Where are the peer-reviewed journals? Where is the serious work?\\u201d\\n\\nGreer is intimately familiar with these bad facts and where they come from \\u2014 she thinks she might inadvertently be responsible for one of the most persistent. Years ago, she looked at sources of water pollution in the only province in China that had good government data, the highly industrialized Shaanxi, and found that the textile industry was the second most polluting after the chemical industry in that particular province. \\u201cI thought, okay, for my purposes of NRDC trying to get on top of polluters in China, this is fine. I can use this.\\u201d She went on to found the NRDC\\u2019s Clean by Design program, which helped increase water and energy efficiency at Chinese textile factories, partly on the basis of this transparently back-of-the-envelope calculation.\\n\\nAt some point in the next decade, the belief that globally, the fashion industry is the second most polluting industry after oil took off, much to her horror. (It continued to circulate even after I debunked it for Racked in 2017.) And better data has never emerged. \\u201cSomebody by now should have gone ahead and figured out what\\u2019s really true,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nAs the co-founder of the now-defunct ethical e-tailer Zady, Maxine B\\u00e9dat used to repeat many of these non-facts at sustainable fashion panels. After Zady shut down, she founded an organization called the New Standard Institute. Her goal is to collect all the best information about the fashion industry in one place and leverage it to pressure fashion brands to do something about their footprint. But as she and NSI research volunteers started to peel away the layers of each statistic, she realized that there was nothing at their core.\\n\\nI asked B\\u00e9dat in January if she had found any fashion facts that were true or had a reliable primary source, but she says NSI is not yet ready to go on the record endorsing anything. \\u201cI can tell you a bunch that are not true,\\u201d she says. She homes in on the stat that says that there are 60 million garment workers globally, which the advocacy organization Clean Clothes cited as from the International Labor Organization. \\u201cWe reached out to ILO, who doesn\\u2019t have a record of this information. It was also used by BetterWorks, Sustainable Brand Solidarity Center, and IndustriAll. Seventy-five million garment workers globally was also found in a Clean Clothes publication, and they cite Fashion United, but the link doesn\\u2019t mention that stat.\\u201d\\n\\nThis is what happens in the fashion sustainability space. One organization puts out a fact, and four other organizations link to it, and then nobody remembers or cares who first made the claim.\\n\\nThe statistic that 4 percent of global waste is from the fashion industry is the most well-sourced fact I\\u2019ve found, eventually leading back to a report by the UK nonprofit Waste & Resources Action Program (WRAP) on the waste associated with clothing sold in the UK, which is based on a peer-reviewed tool whose methodology is laid out in a robust technical analysis. It still may not be true, given that the global waste figure is extrapolated from UK figures and then compared to a stat from the UN, which hasn\\u2019t proved to be very reliable on fashion figures. But at least it\\u2019s transparent.\\n\\nWRAP\\u2019s transparency is in contrast to the consulting firm McKinsey, which says that between 2000 and 2014, global clothing production doubled, and the number of garments purchased each year by the average consumer increased by around 60 percent, to 100 billion garments per year. (The documentary The True Cost says we purchase 80 billion garments a year, while the World Economic Forum puts it at 150 billion.) Where did the figure of 100 billion garments come from? McKinsey would only say that it analyzed proprietary data provided by market research firms to come to their conclusions. And yet, in fashion\\u2019s desert of scientific research, a report with zero footnotes from a company that has reportedly helped Saudi Arabia silence critics and \\u2014 over objections from the World Health Organization \\u2014 brought an ethos of cost-cutting to the arena of global health is what passes for reputable information.\\n\\nThe McKinsey website also used to say that nearly three-fifths of all clothing produced ends up in incinerators or landfills within \\u201cone year\\u201d of being made but at some point changed it to the vague \\u201cwithin years.\\u201d\\n\\nAn Ellen MacArthur Foundation report says that 20 percent of global industrial water pollution is from the fashion industry, but EcoTextile News shredded this in its December issue dedicated to myth-busting, tracking the statistic back to a vague assertion by a 2012 paper that attributed it to the World Bank; the bank denied it was the origin of the fact. Also attributed to the World Bank is the fact that 80 percent of garment workers worldwide are women, but when I asked, a representative directed me to an article that says 80 percent of garment workers in Bangladesh are women and then to a conflicting World Bank report that says it\\u2019s actually 54 percent. The idea that the average American throws away 80 pounds of clothing comes from a 2014 Environmental Protection Agency report, but that data is also inaccurate: It includes textiles like carpets and mattresses and garment factory waste.\\n\\nAnd finally, one statistic you\\u2019ll see in almost every story and at every panel: the greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the global fashion industry. According to the UN, it\\u2019s 10 percent of global emissions. But according to a 2018 report by the sustainability consulting firm Quantis, it\\u2019s 8 percent.\\n\\n\\u201cLet\\u2019s talk for a moment about the Quantis report,\\u201d says Greer. \\u201cThey refused to provide anybody \\u2014 me, Climate Works Foundation that funded them, or the general public \\u2014 any of the data that went into their conclusions. If you were to try to publish that in a peer-reviewed journal, you would be rejected in 30 minutes. It should have died a quick death.\\u201d\\n\\nThe report didn\\u2019t die. It was pulled off the Quantis website for a few months, then republished without Climate Works\\u2019 name on it. And it keeps getting cited. By me, by other journalists, by panelists, by everyone. There\\u2019s just nothing else to go on.\\n\\nEven without good data, brands and countries are attempting to lessen the fashion industry\\u2019s impact. Last year, 150 companies joined a pact where they agreed to \\u201cscience-based\\u201d targets around emissions, biodiversity, and single-use plastics by 2050. It\\u2019s the latest in a long line of industry groups, agreements, conferences, promises, and \\u201csustainable\\u201d product lines. But companies still don\\u2019t know what is happening in their supply chains, and so have no baseline for what they will cut their emissions from. (According to a report by Greer\\u2019s organization, Nike is the only brand that regularly asks for emissions data from its factories in China.)\\n\\nSome of this bad data has even cynically been pressed into service to increase our consumption. \\u201cDouble sales and retention,\\u201d crows a marketing company that creates carbon emission calculators for eco brands. \\u201cBy purchasing a product, visitors fully understand their positive environmental impact!\\u201d\\n\\nBrands have also zeroed in on circular design, a utopian economy where waste materials would be recycled right back into new clothes. (Right now, we think that 99 percent of old clothing is eventually landfilled or burned. Don\\u2019t ask me to find the primary source for that.) As a result, Nordic countries \\u2014 the only governments that have committed any resources to improving the fashion industry \\u2014 are pouring money into textile R&D. Sure, that will help with waste, but what if it ends up increasing fashion\\u2019s footprint in other areas?\\n\\n\\u201cIf they put out a rule that is based on ... this 20 percent stat, then it\\u2019s not going to survive a courtroom challenge\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere is the data that shows what the difference is in terms of carbon emissions, water use, toxic chemical use in a fully circular economy for the fashion industry?\\u201d Greer asks. \\u201cI\\u2019ve yet to see numbers.\\u201d She\\u2019s spent decades at the NRDC working to protect the environment from industrial pollution and knows firsthand the kind of robust research literature that has to undergird government rulemaking on corporate pollution. The false stat about how much global industrial water pollution comes from the fashion industry, for instance, is not going to cut it. \\u201cIf they put out a rule that is based on something as flip-floppy as this 20 percent stat, then it\\u2019s not going to survive a courtroom challenge,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s clear that before we do anything else \\u2014 demand legislation, invent new textiles, set targets \\u2014 we need to figure out what research we need, then ask the government and big brands to fund it.\\n\\n\\u201cWe need a landscape assessment of the data and an analysis of the gaps and inconsistencies that\\u2019s crisp,\\u201d Greer says. \\u201cAnd then a call for funding the research to fill those gaps. Then we\\u2019d be making progress.\\u201d\\n\\nThat money needs to come from the government or a consortium of fashion brands, because getting good data is expensive. For example, the California nonprofit Fibershed is planning a fiber mapping project where it would go into people\\u2019s closets, look at all the tags in their clothing, weigh the clothing, and then process the data to yield high-quality research on the fiber mix in our closets. Founder Rebecca Burgess estimates that it will cost more than $100,000 just for California.\\n\\n\\u201cAll these sociological and quantitative data sets on the labor side would cost as much or more money,\\u201d Burgess says. \\u201cWe need funding for people to be on the ground to take water samples, to go into factories and count how many workers are women. Unless the public is crying for it, who is going to fund that?\\u201d\\n\\nThere is some progress. Last May, Stella McCartney and Google announced a partnership to test Google\\u2019s data-processing prowess by quantifying the impact of various types of cotton and viscose, using McCartney\\u2019s data and more data they hope to collect from researchers and brands. But the fear is that the resulting data will only be available for brands to use.\\n\\n\\u201cIf we don\\u2019t invest as an industry in this process, any company can say anything and we can\\u2019t say whether it\\u2019s meaningful\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s not enough investment in academia, but I can say there\\u2019s a lot of money in private research,\\u201d says Dr. Joanne Brasch, a lecturer at UC Davis on textile sustainability and special project manager at the nonprofit California Product Stewardship Council. She sees her students get snapped up by fashion brands at graduation, essentially privatizing the vast majority of fashion science.\\n\\nThis might be her last year at UC Davis, too. Her research funding has dried up, and UC Davis shut down the two undergraduate majors, textiles and clothing and polymer science.

Whenever a journalist like me writes a story about, say, activists protesting London Fashion Week, I also need to tell you why you should care and should keep reading. After all, there are so many other worthy things that demand our attention these days. So consider the following harrowing, commonly repeated facts:\\n\\u2022 Eight to 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from the fashion industry, which is more than the aviation and maritime shipping industries combined.\\n\\u2022 The fashion industry produces and sells somewhere between 80 billion and 150 billion garments a year globally.\\n\\u2022 Nearly three-fifths of all clothing produced ends up in incinerators or landfills within years of being made.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s clear that the fashion industry is a big, stinking mess. But if you take a moment to ponder these facts, you realize that something is \\u2026 off. An estimated range of 80 billion to 150 billion garments a year is ridiculously wide. The two most common estimates for fashion\\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions vary by a billion tons, a huge margin of error. And saying three-fifths of clothing will be trashed within \\u201cyears\\u201d is a meaningless statement.\\n\\nYet I pulled all of these statistics and other common facts from reputable sources: McKinsey. The United Nations. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The World Bank. International labor unions. Advocacy organizations. And these facts have been cited by publications like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.\\n\\nNot all of these highly respected experts could be wrong. Could they?\\n\\nOnly one out of the dozen or so most commonly cited facts about the fashion industry\\u2019s footprint is based on science\\n\\nIt turns out they could. Because only one out of the dozen or so most commonly cited facts about the fashion industry\\u2019s huge footprint is based on any sort of science, data collection, or peer-reviewed research. The rest are based on gut feelings, broken links, marketing, and something someone said in 2003.\\n\\nIf we\\u2019re serious about recruiting the fashion industry into the fight to save our world from burning, these bad facts do us all a disservice. They make fashion activists look silly. They allow brands to wave vaguely at reducing their impact without taking meaningful action. And they stymy the ability to implement meaningful regulation, which needs to be undergirded by solid data.\\n\\nThere are unmissable clues everywhere that something is wrong, from poisonous rivers in Bangladesh and Indonesia to old clothing littering the shores of East Africa to microplastics in our drinking water.

But if you take a moment to ponder these facts, you realize that something is \\u2026 off. An estimated range of 80 billion to 150 billion garments a year is ridiculously wide. The two most common estimates for fashion\\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions vary by a billion tons, a huge margin of error. And saying three-fifths of clothing will be trashed within \\u201cyears\\u201d is a meaningless statement.\\n\\nYet I pulled all of these statistics and other common facts from reputable sources: McKinsey. The United Nations. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The World Bank. International labor unions. Advocacy organizations. And these facts have been cited by publications like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.\\n\\nNot all of these highly respected experts could be wrong. Could they?\\n\\nOnly one out of the dozen or so most commonly cited facts about the fashion industry\\u2019s footprint is based on science\\n\\nIt turns out they could. Because only one out of the dozen or so most commonly cited facts about the fashion industry\\u2019s huge footprint is based on any sort of science, data collection, or peer-reviewed research. The rest are based on gut feelings, broken links, marketing, and something someone said in 2003.\\n\\nIf we\\u2019re serious about recruiting the fashion industry into the fight to save our world from burning, these bad facts do us all a disservice. They make fashion activists look silly. They allow brands to wave vaguely at reducing their impact without taking meaningful action. And they stymy the ability to implement meaningful regulation, which needs to be undergirded by solid data.\\n\\nThere are unmissable clues everywhere that something is wrong, from poisonous rivers in Bangladesh and Indonesia to old clothing littering the shores of East Africa to microplastics in our drinking water. But as long as we have only garbage information, we\\u2019ll only get garbage action from brands and governments to fix the problem.\\n\\n\\u201cWhere are the technical papers? Where are the peer-reviewed journals? Where is the serious work?\\u201d says Dr. Linda Greer, a former senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council and now a senior global fellow at the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a Chinese environmental NGO. \\u201cYou couldn\\u2019t even get a master\\u2019s degree with this, not even close.\\u201d (Sick burn from someone with a PhD in toxicology.) \\u201cAnd here we are trying to run a whole industry\\u2019s environmental footprint reduction based on this kind of stuff. It\\u2019s kind of preposterous that people put up with it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere are the technical papers? Where are the peer-reviewed journals? Where is the serious work?\\u201d\\n\\nGreer is intimately familiar with these bad facts and where they come from \\u2014 she thinks she might inadvertently be responsible for one of the most persistent. Years ago, she looked at sources of water pollution in the only province in China that had good government data, the highly industrialized Shaanxi, and found that the textile industry was the second most polluting after the chemical industry in that particular province. \\u201cI thought, okay, for my purposes of NRDC trying to get on top of polluters in China, this is fine. I can use this.\\u201d She went on to found the NRDC\\u2019s Clean by Design program, which helped increase water and energy efficiency at Chinese textile factories, partly on the basis of this transparently back-of-the-envelope calculation.\\n\\nAt some point in the next decade, the belief that globally, the fashion industry is the second most polluting industry after oil took off, much to her horror. (It continued to circulate even after I debunked it for Racked in 2017.) And better data has never emerged. \\u201cSomebody by now should have gone ahead and figured out what\\u2019s really true,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nAs the co-founder of the now-defunct ethical e-tailer Zady, Maxine B\\u00e9dat used to repeat many of these non-facts at sustainable fashion panels. After Zady shut down, she founded an organization called the New Standard Institute. Her goal is to collect all the best information about the fashion industry in one place and leverage it to pressure fashion brands to do something about their footprint. But as she and NSI research volunteers started to peel away the layers of each statistic, she realized that there was nothing at their core.\\n\\nI asked B\\u00e9dat in January if she had found any fashion facts that were true or had a reliable primary source, but she says NSI is not yet ready to go on the record endorsing anything. \\u201cI can tell you a bunch that are not true,\\u201d she says. She homes in on the stat that says that there are 60 million garment workers globally, which the advocacy organization Clean Clothes cited as from the International Labor Organization. \\u201cWe reached out to ILO, who doesn\\u2019t have a record of this information. It was also used by BetterWorks, Sustainable Brand Solidarity Center, and IndustriAll. Seventy-five million garment workers globally was also found in a Clean Clothes publication, and they cite Fashion United, but the link doesn\\u2019t mention that stat.\\u201d\\n\\nThis is what happens in the fashion sustainability space. One organization puts out a fact, and four other organizations link to it, and then nobody remembers or cares who first made the claim.\\n\\nThe statistic that 4 percent of global waste is from the fashion industry is the most well-sourced fact I\\u2019ve found, eventually leading back to a report by the UK nonprofit Waste & Resources Action Program (WRAP) on the waste associated with clothing sold in the UK, which is based on a peer-reviewed tool whose methodology is laid out in a robust technical analysis. It still may not be true, given that the global waste figure is extrapolated from UK figures and then compared to a stat from the UN, which hasn\\u2019t proved to be very reliable on fashion figures. But at least it\\u2019s transparent.\\n\\nWRAP\\u2019s transparency is in contrast to the consulting firm McKinsey, which says that between 2000 and 2014, global clothing production doubled, and the number of garments purchased each year by the average consumer increased by around 60 percent, to 100 billion garments per year. (The documentary The True Cost says we purchase 80 billion garments a year, while the World Economic Forum puts it at 150 billion.) Where did the figure of 100 billion garments come from? McKinsey would only say that it analyzed proprietary data provided by market research firms to come to their conclusions. And yet, in fashion\\u2019s desert of scientific research, a report with zero footnotes from a company that has reportedly helped Saudi Arabia silence critics and \\u2014 over objections from the World Health Organization \\u2014 brought an ethos of cost-cutting to the arena of global health is what passes for reputable information.\\n\\nThe McKinsey website also used to say that nearly three-fifths of all clothing produced ends up in incinerators or landfills within \\u201cone year\\u201d of being made but at some point changed it to the vague \\u201cwithin years.\\u201d\\n\\nAn Ellen MacArthur Foundation report says that 20 percent of global industrial water pollution is from the fashion industry, but EcoTextile News shredded this in its December issue dedicated to myth-busting, tracking the statistic back to a vague assertion by a 2012 paper that attributed it to the World Bank; the bank denied it was the origin of the fact. Also attributed to the World Bank is the fact that 80 percent of garment workers worldwide are women, but when I asked, a representative directed me to an article that says 80 percent of garment workers in Bangladesh are women and then to a conflicting World Bank report that says it\\u2019s actually 54 percent. The idea that the average American throws away 80 pounds of clothing comes from a 2014 Environmental Protection Agency report, but that data is also inaccurate: It includes textiles like carpets and mattresses and garment factory waste.\\n\\nAnd finally, one statistic you\\u2019ll see in almost every story and at every panel: the greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the global fashion industry. According to the UN, it\\u2019s 10 percent of global emissions. But according to a 2018 report by the sustainability consulting firm Quantis, it\\u2019s 8 percent.\\n\\n\\u201cLet\\u2019s talk for a moment about the Quantis report,\\u201d says Greer. \\u201cThey refused to provide anybody \\u2014 me, Climate Works Foundation that funded them, or the general public \\u2014 any of the data that went into their conclusions. If you were to try to publish that in a peer-reviewed journal, you would be rejected in 30 minutes. It should have died a quick death.\\u201d\\n\\nThe report didn\\u2019t die. It was pulled off the Quantis website for a few months, then republished without Climate Works\\u2019 name on it. And it keeps getting cited. By me, by other journalists, by panelists, by everyone. There\\u2019s just nothing else to go on.\\n\\nEven without good data, brands and countries are attempting to lessen the fashion industry\\u2019s impact. Last year, 150 companies joined a pact where they agreed to \\u201cscience-based\\u201d targets around emissions, biodiversity, and single-use plastics by 2050. It\\u2019s the latest in a long line of industry groups, agreements, conferences, promises, and \\u201csustainable\\u201d product lines. But companies still don\\u2019t know what is happening in their supply chains, and so have no baseline for what they will cut their emissions from. (According to a report by Greer\\u2019s organization, Nike is the only brand that regularly asks for emissions data from its factories in China.)\\n\\nSome of this bad data has even cynically been pressed into service to increase our consumption. \\u201cDouble sales and retention,\\u201d crows a marketing company that creates carbon emission calculators for eco brands. \\u201cBy purchasing a product, visitors fully understand their positive environmental impact!\\u201d\\n\\nBrands have also zeroed in on circular design, a utopian economy where waste materials would be recycled right back into new clothes. (Right now, we think that 99 percent of old clothing is eventually landfilled or burned. Don\\u2019t ask me to find the primary source for that.) As a result, Nordic countries \\u2014 the only governments that have committed any resources to improving the fashion industry \\u2014 are pouring money into textile R&D. Sure, that will help with waste, but what if it ends up increasing fashion\\u2019s footprint in other areas?\\n\\n\\u201cIf they put out a rule that is based on ... this 20 percent stat, then it\\u2019s not going to survive a courtroom challenge\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere is the data that shows what the difference is in terms of carbon emissions, water use, toxic chemical use in a fully circular economy for the fashion industry?\\u201d Greer asks. \\u201cI\\u2019ve yet to see numbers.\\u201d She\\u2019s spent decades at the NRDC working to protect the environment from industrial pollution and knows firsthand the kind of robust research literature that has to undergird government rulemaking on corporate pollution. The false stat about how much global industrial water pollution comes from the fashion industry, for instance, is not going to cut it. \\u201cIf they put out a rule that is based on something as flip-floppy as this 20 percent stat, then it\\u2019s not going to survive a courtroom challenge,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s clear that before we do anything else \\u2014 demand legislation, invent new textiles, set targets \\u2014 we need to figure out what research we need, then ask the government and big brands to fund it.\\n\\n\\u201cWe need a landscape assessment of the data and an analysis of the gaps and inconsistencies that\\u2019s crisp,\\u201d Greer says. \\u201cAnd then a call for funding the research to fill those gaps. Then we\\u2019d be making progress.\\u201d\\n\\nThat money needs to come from the government or a consortium of fashion brands, because getting good data is expensive. For example, the California nonprofit Fibershed is planning a fiber mapping project where it would go into people\\u2019s closets, look at all the tags in their clothing, weigh the clothing, and then process the data to yield high-quality research on the fiber mix in our closets. Founder Rebecca Burgess estimates that it will cost more than $100,000 just for California.\\n\\n\\u201cAll these sociological and quantitative data sets on the labor side would cost as much or more money,\\u201d Burgess says. \\u201cWe need funding for people to be on the ground to take water samples, to go into factories and count how many workers are women. Unless the public is crying for it, who is going to fund that?\\u201d\\n\\nThere is some progress. Last May, Stella McCartney and Google announced a partnership to test Google\\u2019s data-processing prowess by quantifying the impact of various types of cotton and viscose, using McCartney\\u2019s data and more data they hope to collect from researchers and brands. But the fear is that the resulting data will only be available for brands to use.\\n\\n\\u201cIf we don\\u2019t invest as an industry in this process, any company can say anything and we can\\u2019t say whether it\\u2019s meaningful\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s not enough investment in academia, but I can say there\\u2019s a lot of money in private research,\\u201d says Dr. Joanne Brasch, a lecturer at UC Davis on textile sustainability and special project manager at the nonprofit California Product Stewardship Council. She sees her students get snapped up by fashion brands at graduation, essentially privatizing the vast majority of fashion science.\\n\\nThis might be her last year at UC Davis, too. Her research funding has dried up, and UC Davis shut down the two undergraduate majors, textiles and clothing and polymer science. Incoming graduate students interested in fashion sustainability will now have to choose either fashion design or material engineering. Students revolted and signed a resolution against the move, but it was no use. Instead of researching what fashion does to our world, they now can only study how to make more of it.\\n\\n\\u201cThis stuff isn\\u2019t rocket science,\\u201d B\\u00e9dat says. \\u201cThe industry just hasn\\u2019t invested and prioritized this information. And if we don\\u2019t invest as an industry in this process, any company can say anything and we can\\u2019t say yes or no on whether it\\u2019s a meaningful process.\\u201d\\n\\nBut despite all this, she thinks the conversation is shifting. \\u201cI am hopeful in this year and decade that we\\u2019re moving toward bringing clarity into this space.\\u201d\\n\\nSign up for The Goods\\u2019 newsletter and we\\u2019ll send you the best Goods stories exploring what we buy, why we buy it, and why it matters.\", \"author\": \"Alden Wicker\", \"url\": \"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/1/27/21080107/fashion-environment-facts-statistics-impact\", \"published\": \"2020-01-27T07:00:00-05:00\", \"published_utc\": 1580126400, \"collection_utc\": 1580127494}",News,1580126400

So consider the following harrowing, commonly repeated facts:\\n\\u2022 Eight to 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from the fashion industry, which is more than the aviation and maritime shipping industries combined.\\n\\u2022 The fashion industry produces and sells somewhere between 80 billion and 150 billion garments a year globally.\\n\\u2022 Nearly three-fifths of all clothing produced ends up in incinerators or landfills within years of being made.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s clear that the fashion industry is a big, stinking mess.

Because only one out of the dozen or so most commonly cited facts about the fashion industry\\u2019s huge footprint is based on any sort of science, data collection, or peer-reviewed research. The rest are based on gut feelings, broken links, marketing, and something someone said in 2003.\\n\\nIf we\\u2019re serious about recruiting the fashion industry into the fight to save our world from burning, these bad facts do us all a disservice.

Years ago, she looked at sources of water pollution in the only province in China that had good government data, the highly industrialized Shaanxi, and found that the textile industry was the second most polluting after the chemical industry in that particular province. \\u201cI thought, okay, for my purposes of NRDC trying to get on top of polluters in China, this is fine. I can use this.\\u201d She went on to found the NRDC\\u2019s Clean by Design program, which helped increase water and energy efficiency at Chinese textile factories, partly on the basis of this transparently back-of-the-envelope calculation.\\n\\nAt some point in the next decade, the belief that globally, the fashion industry is the second most polluting industry after oil took off, much to her horror. (It continued to circulate even after I debunked it for Racked in 2017.) And better data has never emerged. \\u201cSomebody by now should have gone ahead and figured out what\\u2019s really true,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nAs the co-founder of the now-defunct ethical e-tailer Zady, Maxine B\\u00e9dat used to repeat many of these non-facts at sustainable fashion panels. After Zady shut down, she founded an organization called the New Standard Institute. Her goal is to collect all the best information about the fashion industry in one place and leverage it to pressure fashion brands to do something about their footprint. But as she and NSI research volunteers started to peel away the layers of each statistic, she realized that there was nothing at their core.\\n\\nI asked B\\u00e9dat in January if she had found any fashion facts that were true or had a reliable primary source, but she says NSI is not yet ready to go on the record endorsing anything. \\u201cI can tell you a bunch that are not true,\\u201d she says. She homes in on the stat that says that there are 60 million garment workers globally, which the advocacy organization Clean Clothes cited as from the International Labor Organization. \\u201cWe reached out to ILO, who doesn\\u2019t have a record of this information. It was also used by BetterWorks, Sustainable Brand Solidarity Center, and IndustriAll. Seventy-five million garment workers globally was also found in a Clean Clothes publication, and they cite Fashion United, but the link doesn\\u2019t mention that stat.\\u201d\\n\\nThis is what happens in the fashion sustainability space. One organization puts out a fact, and four other organizations link to it, and then nobody remembers or cares who first made the claim.\\n\\nThe statistic that 4 percent of global waste is from the fashion industry is the most well-sourced fact I\\u2019ve found, eventually leading back to a report by the UK nonprofit Waste & Resources Action Program (WRAP) on the waste associated with clothing sold in the UK, which is based on a peer-reviewed tool whose methodology is laid out in a robust technical analysis. It still may not be true, given that the global waste figure is extrapolated from UK figures and then compared to a stat from the UN, which hasn\\u2019t proved to be very reliable on fashion figures. But at least it\\u2019s transparent.\\n\\nWRAP\\u2019s transparency is in contrast to the consulting firm McKinsey, which says that between 2000 and 2014, global clothing production doubled, and the number of garments purchased each year by the average consumer increased by around 60 percent, to 100 billion garments per year. (The documentary The True Cost says we purchase 80 billion garments a year, while the World Economic Forum puts it at 150 billion.) Where did the figure of 100 billion garments come from? McKinsey would only say that it analyzed proprietary data provided by market research firms to come to their conclusions. And yet, in fashion\\u2019s desert of scientific research, a report with zero footnotes from a company that has reportedly helped Saudi Arabia silence critics and \\u2014 over objections from the World Health Organization \\u2014 brought an ethos of cost-cutting to the arena of global health is what passes for reputable information.\\n\\nThe McKinsey website also used to say that nearly three-fifths of all clothing produced ends up in incinerators or landfills within \\u201cone year\\u201d of being made but at some point changed it to the vague \\u201cwithin years.\\u201d\\n\\nAn Ellen MacArthur Foundation report says that 20 percent of global industrial water pollution is from the fashion industry, but EcoTextile News shredded this in its December issue dedicated to myth-busting, tracking the statistic back to a vague assertion by a 2012 paper that attributed it to the World Bank; the bank denied it was the origin of the fact. Also attributed to the World Bank is the fact that 80 percent of garment workers worldwide are women, but when I asked, a representative directed me to an article that says 80 percent of garment workers in Bangladesh are women and then to a conflicting World Bank report that says it\\u2019s actually 54 percent. The idea that the average American throws away 80 pounds of clothing comes from a 2014 Environmental Protection Agency report, but that data is also inaccurate: It includes textiles like carpets and mattresses and garment factory waste.\\n\\nAnd finally, one statistic you\\u2019ll see in almost every story and at every panel: the greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the global fashion industry. According to the UN, it\\u2019s 10 percent of global emissions. But according to a 2018 report by the sustainability consulting firm Quantis, it\\u2019s 8 percent.\\n\\n\\u201cLet\\u2019s talk for a moment about the Quantis report,\\u201d says Greer. \\u201cThey refused to provide anybody \\u2014 me, Climate Works Foundation that funded them, or the general public \\u2014 any of the data that went into their conclusions. If you were to try to publish that in a peer-reviewed journal, you would be rejected in 30 minutes. It should have died a quick death.\\u201d\\n\\nThe report didn\\u2019t die. It was pulled off the Quantis website for a few months, then republished without Climate Works\\u2019 name on it. And it keeps getting cited. By me, by other journalists, by panelists, by everyone. There\\u2019s just nothing else to go on.\\n\\nEven without good data, brands and countries are attempting to lessen the fashion industry\\u2019s impact. Last year, 150 companies joined a pact where they agreed to \\u201cscience-based\\u201d targets around emissions, biodiversity, and single-use plastics by 2050. It\\u2019s the latest in a long line of industry groups, agreements, conferences, promises, and \\u201csustainable\\u201d product lines. But companies still don\\u2019t know what is happening in their supply chains, and so have no baseline for what they will cut their emissions from. (According to a report by Greer\\u2019s organization, Nike is the only brand that regularly asks for emissions data from its factories in China.)\\n\\nSome of this bad data has even cynically been pressed into service to increase our consumption. \\u201cDouble sales and retention,\\u201d crows a marketing company that creates carbon emission calculators for eco brands. \\u201cBy purchasing a product, visitors fully understand their positive environmental impact!\\u201d\\n\\nBrands have also zeroed in on circular design, a utopian economy where waste materials would be recycled right back into new clothes. (Right now, we think that 99 percent of old clothing is eventually landfilled or burned. Don\\u2019t ask me to find the primary source for that.) As a result, Nordic countries \\u2014 the only governments that have committed any resources to improving the fashion industry \\u2014 are pouring money into textile R&D. Sure, that will help with waste, but what if it ends up increasing fashion\\u2019s footprint in other areas?\\n\\n\\u201cIf they put out a rule that is based on ... this 20 percent stat, then it\\u2019s not going to survive a courtroom challenge\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere is the data that shows what the difference is in terms of carbon emissions, water use, toxic chemical use in a fully circular economy for the fashion industry?\\u201d Greer asks. \\u201cI\\u2019ve yet to see numbers.\\u201d She\\u2019s spent decades at the NRDC working to protect the environment from industrial pollution and knows firsthand the kind of robust research literature that has to undergird government rulemaking on corporate pollution. The false stat about how much global industrial water pollution comes from the fashion industry, for instance, is not going to cut it. \\u201cIf they put out a rule that is based on something as flip-floppy as this 20 percent stat, then it\\u2019s not going to survive a courtroom challenge,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s clear that before we do anything else \\u2014 demand legislation, invent new textiles, set targets \\u2014 we need to figure out what research we need, then ask the government and big brands to fund it.\\n\\n\\u201cWe need a landscape assessment of the data and an analysis of the gaps and inconsistencies that\\u2019s crisp,\\u201d Greer says. \\u201cAnd then a call for funding the research to fill those gaps. Then we\\u2019d be making progress.\\u201d\\n\\nThat money needs to come from the government or a consortium of fashion brands, because getting good data is expensive. For example, the California nonprofit Fibershed is planning a fiber mapping project where it would go into people\\u2019s closets, look at all the tags in their clothing, weigh the clothing, and then process the data to yield high-quality research on the fiber mix in our closets. Founder Rebecca Burgess estimates that it will cost more than $100,000 just for California.\\n\\n\\u201cAll these sociological and quantitative data sets on the labor side would cost as much or more money,\\u201d Burgess says. \\u201cWe need funding for people to be on the ground to take water samples, to go into factories and count how many workers are women. Unless the public is crying for it, who is going to fund that?\\u201d\\n\\nThere is some progress. Last May, Stella McCartney and Google announced a partnership to test Google\\u2019s data-processing prowess by quantifying the impact of various types of cotton and viscose, using McCartney\\u2019s data and more data they hope to collect from researchers and brands. But the fear is that the resulting data will only be available for brands to use.\\n\\n\\u201cIf we don\\u2019t invest as an industry in this process, any company can say anything and we can\\u2019t say whether it\\u2019s meaningful\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s not enough investment in academia, but I can say there\\u2019s a lot of money in private research,\\u201d says Dr. Joanne Brasch, a lecturer at UC Davis on textile sustainability and special project manager at the nonprofit California Product Stewardship Council. She sees her students get snapped up by fashion brands at graduation, essentially privatizing the vast majority of fashion science.\\n\\nThis might be her last year at UC Davis, too. Her research funding has dried up, and UC Davis shut down the two undergraduate majors, textiles and clothing and polymer science. Incoming graduate students interested in fashion sustainability will now have to choose either fashion design or material engineering. Students revolted and signed a resolution against the move, but it was no use. Instead of researching what fashion does to our world, they now can only study how to make more of it.\\n\\n\\u201cThis stuff isn\\u2019t rocket science,\\u201d B\\u00e9dat says. \\u201cThe industry just hasn\\u2019t invested and prioritized this information.

As a result, Nordic countries \\u2014 the only governments that have committed any resources to improving the fashion industry \\u2014 are pouring money into textile R&D.

The false stat about how much global industrial water pollution comes from the fashion industry, for instance, is not going to cut it. \\u201cIf they put out a rule that is based on something as flip-floppy as this 20 percent stat, then it\\u2019s not going to survive a courtroom challenge,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s clear that before we do anything else \\u2014 demand legislation, invent new textiles, set targets \\u2014 we need to figure out what research we need, then ask the government and big brands to fund it.\\n\\n\\u201cWe need a landscape assessment of the data and an analysis of the gaps and inconsistencies that\\u2019s crisp,\\u201d Greer says. \\u201cAnd then a call for funding the research to fill those gaps.

Whenever a journalist like me writes a story about, say, activists protesting London Fashion Week, I also need to tell you why you should care and should keep reading. After all, there are so many other worthy things that demand our attention these days. So consider the following harrowing, commonly repeated facts:\\n\\u2022 Eight to 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from the fashion industry, which is more than the aviation and maritime shipping industries combined.\\n\\u2022 The fashion industry produces and sells somewhere between 80 billion and 150 billion garments a year globally.\\n\\u2022 Nearly three-fifths of all clothing produced ends up in incinerators or landfills within years of being made.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s clear that the fashion industry is a big, stinking mess. But if you take a moment to ponder these facts, you realize that something is \\u2026 off. An estimated range of 80 billion to 150 billion garments a year is ridiculously wide. The two most common estimates for fashion\\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions vary by a billion tons, a huge margin of error. And saying three-fifths of clothing will be trashed within \\u201cyears\\u201d is a meaningless statement.\\n\\nYet I pulled all of these statistics and other common facts from reputable sources: McKinsey. The United Nations. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The World Bank. International labor unions. Advocacy organizations. And these facts have been cited by publications like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.\\n\\nNot all of these highly respected experts could be wrong. Could they?\\n\\nOnly one out of the dozen or so most commonly cited facts about the fashion industry\\u2019s footprint is based on science\\n\\nIt turns out they could. Because only one out of the dozen or so most commonly cited facts about the fashion industry\\u2019s huge footprint is based on any sort of science, data collection, or peer-reviewed research. The rest are based on gut feelings, broken links, marketing, and something someone said in 2003.\\n\\nIf we\\u2019re serious about recruiting the fashion industry into the fight to save our world from burning, these bad facts do us all a disservice. They make fashion activists look silly. They allow brands to wave vaguely at reducing their impact without taking meaningful action. And they stymy the ability to implement meaningful regulation, which needs to be undergirded by solid data.\\n\\nThere are unmissable clues everywhere that something is wrong, from poisonous rivers in Bangladesh and Indonesia to old clothing littering the shores of East Africa to microplastics in our drinking water. But as long as we have only garbage information, we\\u2019ll only get garbage action from brands and governments to fix the problem.\\n\\n\\u201cWhere are the technical papers? Where are the peer-reviewed journals? Where is the serious work?\\u201d says Dr. Linda Greer, a former senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council and now a senior global fellow at the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a Chinese environmental NGO. \\u201cYou couldn\\u2019t even get a master\\u2019s degree with this, not even close.\\u201d (Sick burn from someone with a PhD in toxicology.) \\u201cAnd here we are trying to run a whole industry\\u2019s environmental footprint reduction based on this kind of stuff. It\\u2019s kind of preposterous that people put up with it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere are the technical papers? Where are the peer-reviewed journals? Where is the serious work?\\u201d\\n\\nGreer is intimately familiar with these bad facts and where they come from \\u2014 she thinks she might inadvertently be responsible for one of the most persistent. Years ago, she looked at sources of water pollution in the only province in China that had good government data, the highly industrialized Shaanxi, and found that the textile industry was the second most polluting after the chemical industry in that particular province. \\u201cI thought, okay, for my purposes of NRDC trying to get on top of polluters in China, this is fine. I can use this.\\u201d She went on to found the NRDC\\u2019s Clean by Design program, which helped increase water and energy efficiency at Chinese textile factories, partly on the basis of this transparently back-of-the-envelope calculation.\\n\\nAt some point in the next decade, the belief that globally, the fashion industry is the second most polluting industry after oil took off, much to her horror. (It continued to circulate even after I debunked it for Racked in 2017.) And better data has never emerged. \\u201cSomebody by now should have gone ahead and figured out what\\u2019s really true,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nAs the co-founder of the now-defunct ethical e-tailer Zady, Maxine B\\u00e9dat used to repeat many of these non-facts at sustainable fashion panels. After Zady shut down, she founded an organization called the New Standard Institute. Her goal is to collect all the best information about the fashion industry in one place and leverage it to pressure fashion brands to do something about their footprint. But as she and NSI research volunteers started to peel away the layers of each statistic, she realized that there was nothing at their core.\\n\\nI asked B\\u00e9dat in January if she had found any fashion facts that were true or had a reliable primary source, but she says NSI is not yet ready to go on the record endorsing anything. \\u201cI can tell you a bunch that are not true,\\u201d she says. She homes in on the stat that says that there are 60 million garment workers globally, which the advocacy organization Clean Clothes cited as from the International Labor Organization. \\u201cWe reached out to ILO, who doesn\\u2019t have a record of this information. It was also used by BetterWorks, Sustainable Brand Solidarity Center, and IndustriAll. Seventy-five million garment workers globally was also found in a Clean Clothes publication, and they cite Fashion United, but the link doesn\\u2019t mention that stat.\\u201d\\n\\nThis is what happens in the fashion sustainability space. One organization puts out a fact, and four other organizations link to it, and then nobody remembers or cares who first made the claim.\\n\\nThe statistic that 4 percent of global waste is from the fashion industry is the most well-sourced fact I\\u2019ve found, eventually leading back to a report by the UK nonprofit Waste & Resources Action Program (WRAP) on the waste associated with clothing sold in the UK, which is based on a peer-reviewed tool whose methodology is laid out in a robust technical analysis. It still may not be true, given that the global waste figure is extrapolated from UK figures and then compared to a stat from the UN, which hasn\\u2019t proved to be very reliable on fashion figures. But at least it\\u2019s transparent.\\n\\nWRAP\\u2019s transparency is in contrast to the consulting firm McKinsey, which says that between 2000 and 2014, global clothing production doubled, and the number of garments purchased each year by the average consumer increased by around 60 percent, to 100 billion garments per year. (The documentary The True Cost says we purchase 80 billion garments a year, while the World Economic Forum puts it at 150 billion.) Where did the figure of 100 billion garments come from? McKinsey would only say that it analyzed proprietary data provided by market research firms to come to their conclusions. And yet, in fashion\\u2019s desert of scientific research, a report with zero footnotes from a company that has reportedly helped Saudi Arabia silence critics and \\u2014 over objections from the World Health Organization \\u2014 brought an ethos of cost-cutting to the arena of global health is what passes for reputable information.\\n\\nThe McKinsey website also used to say that nearly three-fifths of all clothing produced ends up in incinerators or landfills within \\u201cone year\\u201d of being made but at some point changed it to the vague \\u201cwithin years.\\u201d\\n\\nAn Ellen MacArthur Foundation report says that 20 percent of global industrial water pollution is from the fashion industry, but EcoTextile News shredded this in its December issue dedicated to myth-busting, tracking the statistic back to a vague assertion by a 2012 paper that attributed it to the World Bank; the bank denied it was the origin of the fact. Also attributed to the World Bank is the fact that 80 percent of garment workers worldwide are women, but when I asked, a representative directed me to an article that says 80 percent of garment workers in Bangladesh are women and then to a conflicting World Bank report that says it\\u2019s actually 54 percent. The idea that the average American throws away 80 pounds of clothing comes from a 2014 Environmental Protection Agency report, but that data is also inaccurate: It includes textiles like carpets and mattresses and garment factory waste.\\n\\nAnd finally, one statistic you\\u2019ll see in almost every story and at every panel: the greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the global fashion industry. According to the UN, it\\u2019s 10 percent of global emissions. But according to a 2018 report by the sustainability consulting firm Quantis, it\\u2019s 8 percent.\\n\\n\\u201cLet\\u2019s talk for a moment about the Quantis report,\\u201d says Greer. \\u201cThey refused to provide anybody \\u2014 me, Climate Works Foundation that funded them, or the general public \\u2014 any of the data that went into their conclusions. If you were to try to publish that in a peer-reviewed journal, you would be rejected in 30 minutes. It should have died a quick death.\\u201d\\n\\nThe report didn\\u2019t die. It was pulled off the Quantis website for a few months, then republished without Climate Works\\u2019 name on it. And it keeps getting cited. By me, by other journalists, by panelists, by everyone. There\\u2019s just nothing else to go on.\\n\\nEven without good data, brands and countries are attempting to lessen the fashion industry\\u2019s impact. Last year, 150 companies joined a pact where they agreed to \\u201cscience-based\\u201d targets around emissions, biodiversity, and single-use plastics by 2050. It\\u2019s the latest in a long line of industry groups, agreements, conferences, promises, and \\u201csustainable\\u201d product lines. But companies still don\\u2019t know what is happening in their supply chains, and so have no baseline for what they will cut their emissions from. (According to a report by Greer\\u2019s organization, Nike is the only brand that regularly asks for emissions data from its factories in China.)\\n\\nSome of this bad data has even cynically been pressed into service to increase our consumption. \\u201cDouble sales and retention,\\u201d crows a marketing company that creates carbon emission calculators for eco brands. \\u201cBy purchasing a product, visitors fully understand their positive environmental impact!\\u201d\\n\\nBrands have also zeroed in on circular design, a utopian economy where waste materials would be recycled right back into new clothes. (Right now, we think that 99 percent of old clothing is eventually landfilled or burned. Don\\u2019t ask me to find the primary source for that.) As a result, Nordic countries \\u2014 the only governments that have committed any resources to improving the fashion industry \\u2014 are pouring money into textile R&D. Sure, that will help with waste, but what if it ends up increasing fashion\\u2019s footprint in other areas?\\n\\n\\u201cIf they put out a rule that is based on ... this 20 percent stat, then it\\u2019s not going to survive a courtroom challenge\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere is the data that shows what the difference is in terms of carbon emissions, water use, toxic chemical use in a fully circular economy for the fashion industry?\\u201d Greer asks. \\u201cI\\u2019ve yet to see numbers.\\u201d She\\u2019s spent decades at the NRDC working to protect the environment from industrial pollution and knows firsthand the kind of robust research literature that has to undergird government rulemaking on corporate pollution. The false stat about how much global industrial water pollution comes from the fashion industry, for instance, is not going to cut it. \\u201cIf they put out a rule that is based on something as flip-floppy as this 20 percent stat, then it\\u2019s not going to survive a courtroom challenge,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s clear that before we do anything else \\u2014 demand legislation, invent new textiles, set targets \\u2014 we need to figure out what research we need, then ask the government and big brands to fund it.\\n\\n\\u201cWe need a landscape assessment of the data and an analysis of the gaps and inconsistencies that\\u2019s crisp,\\u201d Greer says. \\u201cAnd then a call for funding the research to fill those gaps.

If you were to try to publish that in a peer-reviewed journal, you would be rejected in 30 minutes. It should have died a quick death.\\u201d\\n\\nThe report didn\\u2019t die. It was pulled off the Quantis website for a few months, then republished without Climate Works\\u2019 name on it. And it keeps getting cited. By me, by other journalists, by panelists, by everyone. There\\u2019s just nothing else to go on.\\n\\nEven without good data, brands and countries are attempting to lessen the fashion industry\\u2019s impact. Last year, 150 companies joined a pact where they agreed to \\u201cscience-based\\u201d targets around emissions, biodiversity, and single-use plastics by 2050. It\\u2019s the latest in a long line of industry groups, agreements, conferences, promises, and \\u201csustainable\\u201d product lines. But companies still don\\u2019t know what is happening in their supply chains, and so have no baseline for what they will cut their emissions from. (According to a report by Greer\\u2019s organization, Nike is the only brand that regularly asks for emissions data from its factories in China.)\\n\\nSome of this bad data has even cynically been pressed into service to increase our consumption. \\u201cDouble sales and retention,\\u201d crows a marketing company that creates carbon emission calculators for eco brands. \\u201cBy purchasing a product, visitors fully understand their positive environmental impact!\\u201d\\n\\nBrands have also zeroed in on circular design, a utopian economy where waste materials would be recycled right back into new clothes. (Right now, we think that 99 percent of old clothing is eventually landfilled or burned. Don\\u2019t ask me to find the primary source for that.) As a result, Nordic countries \\u2014 the only governments that have committed any resources to improving the fashion industry \\u2014 are pouring money into textile R&D. Sure, that will help with waste, but what if it ends up increasing fashion\\u2019s footprint in other areas?\\n\\n\\u201cIf they put out a rule that is based on ... this 20 percent stat, then it\\u2019s not going to survive a courtroom challenge\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere is the data that shows what the difference is in terms of carbon emissions, water use, toxic chemical use in a fully circular economy for the fashion industry?\\u201d Greer asks. \\u201cI\\u2019ve yet to see numbers.\\u201d She\\u2019s spent decades at the NRDC working to protect the environment from industrial pollution and knows firsthand the kind of robust research literature that has to undergird government rulemaking on corporate pollution. The false stat about how much global industrial water pollution comes from the fashion industry, for instance, is not going to cut it. \\u201cIf they put out a rule that is based on something as flip-floppy as this 20 percent stat, then it\\u2019s not going to survive a courtroom challenge,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s clear that before we do anything else \\u2014 demand legislation, invent new textiles, set targets \\u2014 we need to figure out what research we need, then ask the government and big brands to fund it.\\n\\n\\u201cWe need a landscape assessment of the data and an analysis of the gaps and inconsistencies that\\u2019s crisp,\\u201d Greer says. \\u201cAnd then a call for funding the research to fill those gaps. Then we\\u2019d be making progress.\\u201d\\n\\nThat money needs to come from the government or a consortium of fashion brands, because getting good data is expensive. For example, the California nonprofit Fibershed is planning a fiber mapping project where it would go into people\\u2019s closets, look at all the tags in their clothing, weigh the clothing, and then process the data to yield high-quality research on the fiber mix in our closets. Founder Rebecca Burgess estimates that it will cost more than $100,000 just for California.\\n\\n\\u201cAll these sociological and quantitative data sets on the labor side would cost as much or more money,\\u201d Burgess says. \\u201cWe need funding for people to be on the ground to take water samples, to go into factories and count how many workers are women. Unless the public is crying for it, who is going to fund that?\\u201d\\n\\nThere is some progress. Last May, Stella McCartney and Google announced a partnership to test Google\\u2019s data-processing prowess by quantifying the impact of various types of cotton and viscose, using McCartney\\u2019s data and more data they hope to collect from researchers and brands. But the fear is that the resulting data will only be available for brands to use.\\n\\n\\u201cIf we don\\u2019t invest as an industry in this process, any company can say anything and we can\\u2019t say whether it\\u2019s meaningful\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s not enough investment in academia, but I can say there\\u2019s a lot of money in private research,\\u201d says Dr. Joanne Brasch, a lecturer at UC Davis on textile sustainability and special project manager at the nonprofit California Product Stewardship Council. She sees her students get snapped up by fashion brands at graduation, essentially privatizing the vast majority of fashion science.\\n\\nThis might be her last year at UC Davis, too. Her research funding has dried up, and UC Davis shut down the two undergraduate majors, textiles and clothing and polymer science. Incoming graduate students interested in fashion sustainability will now have to choose either fashion design or material engineering. Students revolted and signed a resolution against the move, but it was no use. Instead of researching what fashion does to our world, they now can only study how to make more of it.\\n\\n\\u201cThis stuff isn\\u2019t rocket science,\\u201d B\\u00e9dat says. \\u201cThe industry just hasn\\u2019t invested and prioritized this information. And if we don\\u2019t invest as an industry in this process, any company can say anything and we can\\u2019t say yes or no on whether it\\u2019s a meaningful process.\\u201d\\n\\nBut despite all this, she thinks the conversation is shifting. \\u201cI am hopeful in this year and decade that we\\u2019re moving toward bringing clarity into this space.\\u201d\\n\\nSign up for The Goods\\u2019 newsletter and we\\u2019ll send you the best Goods stories exploring what we buy, why we buy it, and why it matters.\", \"author\": \"Alden Wicker\", \"url\": \"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/1/27/21080107/fashion-environment-facts-statistics-impact\", \"published\": \"2020-01-27T07:00:00-05:00\", \"published_utc\": 1580126400, \"collection_utc\": 1580127494}",News,1580126400

Sabato\\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. \\u201cRepublicans can\\u2019t afford to lose more ground in Texas if they want to win back the House majority this year.\\u201d\\n\\nAt stake is a two-year term that pays $174,000 a year.\\n\\nThis highly desirable district crisscrosses through cities and suburban neighborhoods in Tarrant, Dallas and Denton counties.\\n\\n\\u201cThe district is in the meaty part of suburban Tarrant County which is rapidly changing demographically and slowly shifting to favor Democrats,\\u201d said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston. \\u201cGiven how competitive Democrats have been in suburban districts across the state, all eyes inside and outside Texas will be on this race.\\u201d\\n\\nThis district has been ranked a \\u201ctoss up\\u201d by Larry Sabato\\u2019s Crystal Ball. Cook Political Report said it\\u2019s a Republican toss up. It has been named one of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\\u2019s top targets in 2020. And national Republicans have long said they\\u2019ll defend this seat.\\n\\nMarchant, who spent 40 years in public office but barely won his last re-election bid against a little-known candidate, was among six Texas Republicans not seeking re-election.\\n\\nMarchant was first elected to the post in 2004 with 64% of the vote. His winning percentage fluctuated through the years between 56% in 2008 and 81% in 2010 when he had no Democratic challenger.\\n\\nIn 2016, he won by 56.2% and in 2018 by 50.6%. Democrat Jan McDowell ran against Marchant in both of those races and is among the Democrats seeking their party\\u2019s nomination from this post this year as well.\\n\\nWhen Marchant announced his retirement, candidates on both sides of the political aisle quickly began announcing that they were in the race.\\n\\nThis district \\u201cis one of many affluent, highly educated , and diverse suburban districts across the country that are moving toward the Democrats with Donald Trump leading the Republican Party,\\u201d Kondik said. \\u201cDemocrats view this district as one of their top pickup opportunities in the entire country.\\u201d\\n\\nFive Republicans are in this race: Beth Van Duyne, a former Irving mayor; Desi Maes, a Dallas business owner, Jeron Liverman, a Bedford associated broker/real estate agent; David Fegan, a Colleyville property manager; and Sunny Chaparala, a Dallas real estate broker.\\n\\nAnd seven Democrats joined the race, although Crystal Fletcher, a Dallas attorney, told the Star-Telegram she has ended her campaign.\\n\\nThose still in the race include: Kim Olson, a retired U.S. Air Force Colonel in Colleyville; McDowell, the retired CPA in Carrollton who challenged Marchant for this seat in 2018; John Biggan, a Hurst data scientist and adjunct psychology professor; Richard Fleming, a Carrollton tax adviser; Candace Valenzuela, a former school board trustee from Dallas; and Sam Vega, an Irving project manager/art director.\\n\\n\\u201cCompetitive races across Texas in 2018 showed the Democrats that fielding candidates in all races can yield victories in unlikely places,\\u201d Rottinghaus said. \\u201cA close loss for Democrats and a narrow win for Republicans in 2018 demonstrated that CD 24 is in play politically.\\n\\n\\u201cA surge in turnout in a presidential election year makes this race a clear competitive toss up.\\u201d\\n\\nHere\\u2019s a look at the candidates, according to responses they provided to a Star-Telegram survey.\\n\\nVan Duyne, 49, served as regional HUD administrator in Fort Worth under Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson before running for this post. She resigned the HUD job in early August.\\n\\nIf elected, she said her top priorities include stopping drug cartels and human traffickers, lowering healthcare costs and boosting infrastructure projects. \\u201cWe need a U.S. representative who is focused on delivering solutions and putting progress for the American people ahead of political theater and more Washington nonsense,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nMaes, 53, has never held political office but said he gained valuable experience in the military, working for Fortune 500 companies and running his small business.\\n\\nHis top priorities, if elected, would be securing the border, reducing the budget, slowing government spending and cutting bureaucratic regulations. \\u201cI am running to bring real leadership, real world experience and real results to the people of (the district),\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut most importantly, I want to put service back into public service.\\u201d\\n\\nLiverman, 50, has never held political office but said he has life experiences that include both success and failure. \\u201cI have gracefully danced with both,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nHis priorities include addressing unfairness with healthcare, reducing federal spending and defending the Second Amendment. \\u201cI have evolved and learned from my mistakes over the years,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI believe the voters need someone of my demographic background, age and experiences.\\u201d\\n\\nFegan, 25, is the youngest person in the race and has never held political office. He helps a non-profit group known as Gate House, which is a refuge for battered women and their children.\\n\\nIf elected, he said his priorities are making abortion illegal, fighting efforts to \\u201csocialize everything like Medicare\\u201d and working to \\u201cfix our illegal immigration problem.\\u201d \\u201cI want to see a lasting change in our government,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere is a changing demographic in my district, which is ... interested in someone who has fresh ideas and can genuinely represent\\u201d the district.\\n\\nChaparala did not respond to the Star-Telegram survey.\\n\\nOlson, 62, unsuccessfully ran for Agriculture Commissioner in 2018 against incumbent Republican Sid Miller, losing by just under 400,000 votes. More than 8.2 million votes were cast in the race.\\n\\nHer priorities, if elected, would be to make healthcare affordable for everyone, take action on climate change and reduce gun violence. \\u201cWashington needs more veterans and fewer career politicians,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIf we come together to elect pragmatic leaders instead of partisan ideologues, we can make a difference.\\u201d\\n\\nMcDowell, 66, lost her challenge to Marchant in 2018 by just over 8,000 votes.\\n\\nIf elected, she said her priorities are to save the planet, shrink the economic inequality gap and provide healthcare for all. \\u201cI bring a broad perspective to representing constituents,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI\\u2019m committed to being accessible and accountable to them. I know that winning the seat means winning a JOB, not an award.\\u201d\\n\\nBiggan, 36, is seeking his first political office. He said his knowledge as a scientist would provide a different perspective in Congress.\\n\\nHis priorities, if elected, include addressing climate change, reducing the cost of higher education and lowering the cost of prescription drugs by letting Medicare negotiate prices. He said he realized he needed to become more active after Donald Trump was elected. Trump\\u2019s inauguration \\u201cwas one of the darkest days I can remember,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nFleming, who did not disclose his age, said six generations of his family have lived in this congressional district. He is a former school board trustee for the Carrollton-Farmers Branch district.\\n\\nIf elected, he said his priorities are making sure all Americans have access to affordable health care that covers pre-existing conditions, as well as addressing immigration reform and \\u201ccommon sense\\u201d gun reform. \\u201cI am the only candidate in this race that has proven that he can beat a Republican in a head to head election contest in a mostly Republican district,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nValenzuela, 35, served as a trustee on the Carrollton-Farmers Branch school district from 2017-2019 and resigned to run for this congressional seat. She touts the fact that she unseated an 18-year incumbent to win the post.\\n\\nIf elected, she said her top priorities include investing in infrastructure, making sure large corporations reinvest in the system and boosting investments in education. \\u201cVoters should choose me because, in an extremely diverse district made up of working families, I am a great fit to represent them,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nVega, 30, is seeking his first political office. His priorities, if elected, would be providing Medicare for all, addressing the climate crisis and hammering away at wealth inequality.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m the most progressive and I\\u2019m unapologetic about pushing for progressive policies that I believe will be the most beneficial for everyone,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou can expect transparency from me and a lot less of the typical politician double talk.\\u201d\", \"author\": \"<p><span class=\\\"ng_byline_name\\\">By Anna M.

He was 41.\\n\\nBryant was on board the helicopter with eight others, including his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, when it crashed at 10am local time near Calabasas, 30 miles north-west of downtown Los Angeles, in foggy weather. The crash ignited brushfires, making it hard for rescue crews to get close to the site. There were no survivors. Bryant, who lived in the area for most of his life often used helicopters to beat Los Angeles\\u2019 heavy traffic, and on Sunday he was taking Gianna to play in a basketball game at his academy outside the city.\\n\\n\\u201cWe received a call just before 10am this morning of an aircraft down in the Malibu area, right off of Las Vergenes, essentially Calabasas,\\u201d Tony Imbrenda of the Los Angeles county fire department, told reporters at the scene. \\u201cSome folks were out here mountain biking this morning, they saw an aircraft in distress, they went down into the hillside. This was a helicopter, it\\u2019s been confirmed it was an S-76 Sikorsky helicopter and unfortunately there were no survivors.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board said they will investigate the accident.\\n\\nBryant\\u2019s talent was obvious from an early age, and he was already attracting national attention while still in high school. Unlike most NBA players, he went straight from school to the NBA, foregoing a college career. He played his entire, 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers, where he won five championships with the team and was named an All-Star on 18 occasions. He retired in 2016 as the NBA\\u2019s third-highest all-time scorer.

The number of newly registered Hong Kong and Macao-funded enterprises will reach to 12,000. The business scope of individual industrial and commercial households of Hong Kong and Macao residents will be fully liberalized. Guangdong has made it clear that in the future, it will promote the integration of resources, the complementarity of advantages and the linkage of opening-up measures in the Area to lead an opening pattern with the connection of land and sea, domestic and overseas areas and mutual beneficial cooperation between the east and the west bank of the Pearl River.\\n\\nThe sub-venue of the Spring Festival Gala on the Bridge not only reflects the continuously improving city-to-city connectivity but also witnesses the expansion of cooperation fields between these three places. It is foreseeable that the construction of the Area will promote the development of Hong Kong and Macao, and expand new space for cooperation between China and the world.\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://tass.com/press-releases/1113169\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 09:00:00 +0300\", \"published_utc\": 1580133600, \"collection_utc\": 1580127813}",News,1580133600

Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.On Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city's heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport's pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.Within half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\\"It's kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\\" said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant's death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\\"We knew right away people would be coming.\\\"Minutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.At the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\\"really sad,\\\" said manager Rodolfo Garcia.

If he couldn't come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\\"He liked the carnitas and flan,\\\" Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\\"He loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He'd tell us, 'Don't treat me like a star; I'm just a customer here.'\\\"Bryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and '80s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.Bryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.Bryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant's rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.The 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.Bryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.Bryant and leading scorer Shaquille O'Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game's top player.\\\"There's no words to express the pain I'm going through with this tragedy of loosing my niece Gigi & my brother,\\\" O'Neal tweeted Sunday. \\\"I love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\\"After the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O'Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson's coaching contract was not renewed. As the team's undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.Bryant summed up the tensions between him and O'Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\\"We're great as individuals, but ... it's probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\\"Bryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.His biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.Laker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\\"It is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\\"Bryant's 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\\"I would like to be traded,\\\" Bryant said during a radio interview. \\\"Tough as it is to come to that conclusion, there's no other alternative. It's rough, man, but I don't see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don't know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\\"Bryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol's arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals.With Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.Ongoing soreness in Bryant's knee and ankle coupled with the team's heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers' championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title.Bryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.Following the team's acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant's season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.Bryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.He retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.Just Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA's all-time scoring list.Allen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.By evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said people have flooded into the area of the crash, some going into residential neighborhoods and trying to get to the remote hillside where the helicopter went down.

Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.On Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city's heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport's pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.Within half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\\"It's kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\\" said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant's death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\\"We knew right away people would be coming.\\\"Minutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.At the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\\"really sad,\\\" said manager Rodolfo Garcia.

Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He'd tell us, 'Don't treat me like a star; I'm just a customer here.'\\\"Bryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and '80s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.Bryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.Bryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant's rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.The 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.Bryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.Bryant and leading scorer Shaquille O'Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game's top player.\\\"There's no words to express the pain I'm going through with this tragedy of loosing my niece Gigi & my brother,\\\" O'Neal tweeted Sunday. \\\"I love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\\"After the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O'Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson's coaching contract was not renewed. As the team's undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.Bryant summed up the tensions between him and O'Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\\"We're great as individuals, but ... it's probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\\"Bryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.His biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.Laker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\\"It is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\\"Bryant's 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\\"I would like to be traded,\\\" Bryant said during a radio interview. \\\"Tough as it is to come to that conclusion, there's no other alternative. It's rough, man, but I don't see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don't know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\\"Bryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol's arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals.With Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.Ongoing soreness in Bryant's knee and ankle coupled with the team's heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers' championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title.Bryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.Following the team's acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant's season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.Bryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.He retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.Just Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA's all-time scoring list.Allen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.By evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.L.A.

As word of Bryant's death swept through the arena, crews worked quickly to move Bryant's rafter jerseys side by side and masked the other retired jerseys with curtains.

Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.On Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city's heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport's pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.Within half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\\"It's kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\\" said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant's death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\\"We knew right away people would be coming.\\\"Minutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.At the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\\"really sad,\\\" said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn't come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\\"He liked the carnitas and flan,\\\" Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\\"He loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He'd tell us, 'Don't treat me like a star; I'm just a customer here.'\\\"Bryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and '80s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.Bryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.Bryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant's rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.The 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.Bryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.Bryant and leading scorer Shaquille O'Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game's top player.\\\"There's no words to express the pain I'm going through with this tragedy of loosing my niece Gigi & my brother,\\\" O'Neal tweeted Sunday. \\\"I love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\\"After the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O'Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson's coaching contract was not renewed. As the team's undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.Bryant summed up the tensions between him and O'Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\\"We're great as individuals, but ... it's probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\\"Bryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.His biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.Laker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\\"It is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\\"Bryant's 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\\"I would like to be traded,\\\" Bryant said during a radio interview. \\\"Tough as it is to come to that conclusion, there's no other alternative. It's rough, man, but I don't see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don't know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\\"Bryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol's arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals.With Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.Ongoing soreness in Bryant's knee and ankle coupled with the team's heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers' championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title.Bryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.Following the team's acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant's season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.Bryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.He retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.Just Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA's all-time scoring list.Allen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.By evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said people have flooded into the area of the crash, some going into residential neighborhoods and trying to get to the remote hillside where the helicopter went down. He said the traffic was making it harder for investigators and emergency personnel to do their jobs.\\\"It is off limits to everybody,\\\" he said of the crash site, noting that the Federal Aviation Administration has a 5-mile no-fly zone around it up to altitudes of 5,000 feet. \\\"People, stay away.\\\"\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.sott.net/article/428057-Kobe-Bryant-daughter-Gianna-among-9-dead-in-helicopter-crash-feds-search-for-cause\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 09:05:36 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580133936, \"collection_utc\": 1580128526}",News,1580133936

Some left basketballs outside their homes and posted photos on social media, offering Kobe and Gianna a ball in case they want to play a pickup game in heaven.On Sunday evening, it was impossible to ignore the city's heartbreak. Television screens in the Los Angeles International Airport terminal bars were playing footage of the news as travelers paused to stare. Outside, the airport's pillars were lit up in Lakers purple and gold in honor of Bryant. Downtown, the U.S. Bank Tower shone in the same colors, blocks from Staples Center.Within half an hour of the news breaking, a Barnes & Noble store in Orange had sold out of all photo books featuring Bryant.\\\"It's kind of morose, but people just came in 10 or 15 minutes after we found out about it, \\\" said Armando Romero, a bookseller at the cash register. He said his general manager announced Bryant's death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\\"We knew right away people would be coming.\\\"Minutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.At the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\\"really sad,\\\" said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn't come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\\"He liked the carnitas and flan,\\\" Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\\"He loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He'd tell us, 'Don't treat me like a star; I'm just a customer here.'\\\"Bryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and '80s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.Bryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.Bryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant's rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.The 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.Bryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.Bryant and leading scorer Shaquille O'Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game's top player.\\\"There's no words to express the pain I'm going through with this tragedy of loosing my niece Gigi & my brother,\\\" O'Neal tweeted Sunday. \\\"I love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\\"After the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O'Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson's coaching contract was not renewed. As the team's undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.Bryant summed up the tensions between him and O'Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\\"We're great as individuals, but ... it's probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\\"Bryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.His biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.Laker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\\"It is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\\"Bryant's 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\\"I would like to be traded,\\\" Bryant said during a radio interview. \\\"Tough as it is to come to that conclusion, there's no other alternative. It's rough, man, but I don't see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don't know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\\"Bryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol's arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals.With Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.Ongoing soreness in Bryant's knee and ankle coupled with the team's heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers' championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title.Bryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.Following the team's acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant's season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.Bryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.He retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.Just Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA's all-time scoring list.Allen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.By evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said people have flooded into the area of the crash, some going into residential neighborhoods and trying to get to the remote hillside where the helicopter went down. He said the traffic was making it harder for investigators and emergency personnel to do their jobs.\\\"It is off limits to everybody,\\\" he said of the crash site, noting that the Federal Aviation Administration has a 5-mile no-fly zone around it up to altitudes of 5,000 feet. \\\"People, stay away.\\\"\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.sott.net/article/428057-Kobe-Bryant-daughter-Gianna-among-9-dead-in-helicopter-crash-feds-search-for-cause\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 09:05:36 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580133936, \"collection_utc\": 1580128526}",News,1580133936

He said his general manager announced Bryant's death to the employees over their wireless headsets. \\\"We knew right away people would be coming.\\\"Minutes later, Romero said, he received phone calls from customers, asking to put Bryant-related books on hold.At the Fullerton Mexican restaurant El Camino Real, the staff was \\\"really sad,\\\" said manager Rodolfo Garcia. Bryant patronized the restaurant for 20 years with his wife, a Fullerton native. If he couldn't come in person, Bryant would have friends get big orders to take back to his Newport Coast home.\\\"He liked the carnitas and flan,\\\" Garcia said, over the thud of a butcher breaking down carne asada for tacos. \\\"He loved this place because people treated him like a normal person. Kobe would just stand in line, like anyone else. He'd tell us, 'Don't treat me like a star; I'm just a customer here.'\\\"Bryant was born in Philadelphia. His father, Joe, played eight seasons in the 1970s and '80s for the Philadelphia 76ers, San Diego Clippers and, in his last stop, the Houston Rockets under then-coach Del Harris. A lighthearted, 6-foot-10 stringbean who went by his Philadelphia playground nickname, Jellybean, Joe Bryant played college ball at La Salle and married Pam Cox, the sister of a starting guard at Villanova. They named their first son Kobe, after the city in Japan.Bryant excelled at Lower Merion High in Ardmore, Pa., near Philadelphia, winning numerous national awards as a senior before announcing his intention to skip college and enter the NBA draft. He was selected 13th overall by Charlotte in 1996, but the Lakers had already worked out a deal with the Hornets to acquire Bryant before his selection.Bryant impressed Lakers general manager Jerry West during a pre-draft workout session in Los Angeles. Less than three weeks later, the Lakers traded starting center Vlade Divac to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant's rights. Bryant, whose favorite team growing up was the Lakers, had to have his parents co-sign his NBA contract because he was 17 years old.The 6-foot-6 guard made his pro debut in the 1996-97 season opener against Minnesota; at the time he was the youngest player to appear in an NBA game. He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.Bryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.Bryant and leading scorer Shaquille O'Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game's top player.\\\"There's no words to express the pain I'm going through with this tragedy of loosing my niece Gigi & my brother,\\\" O'Neal tweeted Sunday. \\\"I love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\\"After the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O'Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson's coaching contract was not renewed. As the team's undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.Bryant summed up the tensions between him and O'Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\\"We're great as individuals, but ... it's probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\\"Bryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.His biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.Laker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\\"It is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\\"Bryant's 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\\"I would like to be traded,\\\" Bryant said during a radio interview. \\\"Tough as it is to come to that conclusion, there's no other alternative. It's rough, man, but I don't see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don't know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\\"Bryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol's arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals.With Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.Ongoing soreness in Bryant's knee and ankle coupled with the team's heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers' championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title.Bryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.Following the team's acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant's season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.Bryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.He retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.Just Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA's all-time scoring list.Allen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.By evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said people have flooded into the area of the crash, some going into residential neighborhoods and trying to get to the remote hillside where the helicopter went down. He said the traffic was making it harder for investigators and emergency personnel to do their jobs.\\\"It is off limits to everybody,\\\" he said of the crash site, noting that the Federal Aviation Administration has a 5-mile no-fly zone around it up to altitudes of 5,000 feet. \\\"People, stay away.\\\"\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.sott.net/article/428057-Kobe-Bryant-daughter-Gianna-among-9-dead-in-helicopter-crash-feds-search-for-cause\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 09:05:36 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580133936, \"collection_utc\": 1580128526}",News,1580133936

He started in only a handful of games during his rookie season, coming off the bench in support of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. However, Harris played him more as the season progressed, allowing Bryant to showcase his skills, which were on display when he won the 1997 NBA slam dunk competition.Bryant continued to improve during his sophomore season in the league, averaging 15.4 points per game. But his breakout came in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season when he started in all 50 games after the Lakers traded away Van Exel and Jones.Bryant and leading scorer Shaquille O'Neal quickly morphed into one of the most lethal scoring and defensive combinations in the league. Together, with coach Phil Jackson guiding them, they led the Lakers to three consecutive championships (2000-02) as Bryant began to cement his place as the game's top player.\\\"There's no words to express the pain I'm going through with this tragedy of loosing my niece Gigi & my brother,\\\" O'Neal tweeted Sunday. \\\"I love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.\\\"After the Lakers lost to Detroit in the NBA Finals with a star-studded team that included Karl Malone and Gary Payton, O'Neal was traded to Miami and Jackson's coaching contract was not renewed. As the team's undisputed leader, Bryant signed a seven-year contract to remain with the team.Bryant summed up the tensions between him and O'Neal after the Lakers won the NBA title in 2009: \\\"We're great as individuals, but ... it's probably the first dynamic duo that had two alpha males on one team. We managed to make it work for three championships.\\\"Bryant posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career over the next three seasons, but the team struggled, failing to make the playoffs in 2005 before suffering consecutive first-round defeats to Phoenix in 2006 and 2007. Jackson returned to the team for the 2005-06 season, and Bryant went on to lead the league in scoring that season with a career-best 35.4 average. He scored 40 points or more in 27 games and became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964 to finish with 45 points or more in four consecutive games.His biggest single-game achievement came Jan. 22, 2006, against Toronto when he scored a career-high 81 points, the second most in NBA history. Earlier that season, on Dec. 20, 2005, he scored 62 points in 33 minutes through three quarters of a game against Dallas; he had outscored the entire Mavericks team, 62-61, entering the final quarter, in which Bryant did not play. Bryant continued to impress during the 2006-07 season, scoring 50 or more points in a team-record 10 games and averaging 31.6 points a game to capture his second NBA scoring title.Laker legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was at that game, he said in a Twitter video Sunday. \\\"It is something that I will always remember as one of the highlights of the things that I have learned and observed in sports.\\\"Bryant's 2007-08 NBA MVP season got off to a tumultuous start after he reportedly demanded to be traded. He was reportedly unhappy with Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak and Jackson. \\\"I would like to be traded,\\\" Bryant said during a radio interview. \\\"Tough as it is to come to that conclusion, there's no other alternative. It's rough, man, but I don't see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don't know how you can move forward in that type of situation.\\\"Bryant eventually backtracked on his trade demands and posted perhaps his best all-around season, leading a team re-energized by Pau Gasol's arrival from Memphis in February 2008 to a first-place finish in the Western Conference. The Lakers embarked on a memorable playoff run before losing to Boston in the Finals.With Bryant pleased about the direction the team was heading, he guided the Lakers to back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010. He was named the NBA Finals MVP both years as the team once again ascended to the top of the NBA.Ongoing soreness in Bryant's knee and ankle coupled with the team's heavy reliance in him played a role in the Lakers' championship run coming to an end in 2011. Bryant posted his lowest points per game totals since the 2003-04 season as he dealt with the aftereffects of offseason arthroscopic knee surgery. He went on to win his fourth NBA All-Star Game most-valuable-player award but fell short of his ultimate goal of winning a sixth NBA title.Bryant finished third in league scoring in 2011-12 despite dealing with ongoing knee and ankle issues. In January 2012, he scored at least 40 points in four consecutive games, which included a 48-point effort against the Phoenix Suns.Following the team's acquisition of Dwight Howard in August 2012, the Lakers were regarded as a favorite for the NBA title. However, friction between Bryant and Howard started to develop as the team struggled. Despite this, Bryant led the NBA in scoring for much of the first half of the season and surpassed Chamberlain for fourth all-time in league scoring. But Bryant's season came to a disappointing end when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors on April 10. The injury and subsequent surgery prevented Bryant from playing in the early portion of the 2013-14 season.Bryant, who signed a two-year, $48.5-million contract extension with the Lakers before the start of the 2013-14 season, did not return from injury until December. He played in only six games before suffering a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee. The injury forced him to miss the remainder of the season as the Lakers limped to a 27-55 record, missing the playoffs for only the second time since Bryant joined the franchise.He retired from the NBA but began a new career in Hollywood.Just Saturday night, Laker LeBron James passed Bryant for third on the NBA's all-time scoring list.Allen Kenitzer, an FAA spokesman, said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the helicopter crash.By evening, so many Kobe Bryant fans have converged on the Calabasas area that authorities have restricted the area to residents only.L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said people have flooded into the area of the crash, some going into residential neighborhoods and trying to get to the remote hillside where the helicopter went down. He said the traffic was making it harder for investigators and emergency personnel to do their jobs.\\\"It is off limits to everybody,\\\" he said of the crash site, noting that the Federal Aviation Administration has a 5-mile no-fly zone around it up to altitudes of 5,000 feet. \\\"People, stay away.\\\"\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.sott.net/article/428057-Kobe-Bryant-daughter-Gianna-among-9-dead-in-helicopter-crash-feds-search-for-cause\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 09:05:36 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580133936, \"collection_utc\": 1580128526}",News,1580133936

She was a passionate basketball player, who had her own aspirations of being a star one day. In a previous interview, a proud Kobe said his daughter was \\\"hell-bent\\\" on one day playing for the University of Connecticut women's basketball team. Gianna then hoped to forge her own career in the WNBA. On Sunday evening, some of the final images of Bryant and his daughter were revealed from a day earlier. In the images from Saturday, Bryant could be seen proudly watching on as Gianna played two eight-grade games for Kobe's Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks, California. In others, the proud father, who often coached Gianna's team, could be seen giving a pep talk.

However, Russia needs to give the Su-57 a lot more upgrades and hasn't set up mass production yet.\\n\\nRussian president Vladimir Putin made a big show on May 14, 2019 of visiting the 929th Chkalov State Flight-Test Center in Russia's Astrakhan region.\\n\\nSix Sukhoi Su-57 stealth fighters -- fully half of the Su-57s that Sukhoi has built since the type first flew in 2010 -- escorted Putin\\u2019s Il-96 VIP plane on the trip from Moscow to Astrakhan.\\n\\nSpeaking on May 15, 2019, Putin the Kremlin would buy scores of Su-57s over the next eight years. If Putin is serious and the Russian defense ministry follows through on the pledge, Russia soon could possess a meaningful number of stealth fighters.\\n\\nBut there are good reasons to be skeptical. The Su-57 still isn\\u2019t a mature design. It lacks key combat systems. Sukhoi hasn\\u2019t set up a big, efficient production line for the type. And Moscow almost certainly doesn\\u2019t have the money to buy a large number of stealth fighters.\\n\\nAfter years of slow development, one engine fire and a theatrical \\u201cdeployment\\u201d of apparently non-combat-capable jets to Syria, in 2018 the Kremlin it would all but suspend production of the Su-57 in favor of upgraded versions of the venerable, non-stealthy Su-27.

If you\\u2019ve ever wondered what Star Trek would be like as a modern, Tom Clancy-esque techno-thriller, you\\u2019ve come to the right place. Just in case you\\u2019ve missed the previous installments, you can find them here:\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, if you like this book and want to see it in print, ping Simon & Schuster and Pocket Books on social media and let them know!\\n\\nThe small patch of real estate carved out of the south side of the metroplex had been set aside by the Bezzeret as the Federation\\u2019s operational zone (called OZ on the official maps), but to the small community of scientists and support personnel who lived there it was known as Skid Row\\u2014a modest collection of modular buildings, each one indistinguishable from the others, deposited there by the Starfleet Corps of Engineers when they cobbled the facilities together eight years ago. In that time they had not aged well, taking on the characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood\\u2014a rather seedy part of town as those things went in this day and age, populated by the lower-caste types that always seemed to exist at the fringes of an industrial society, doing the menial jobs that the upper caste would just as soon forget. Flanked by distribution hubs and warehouses, the place didn\\u2019t have much going for it\\u2014just a few shops that sold cheap knock-off goods to offworlders and a dive bar that passed itself off as an exotic cabaret; but the Bezzeret allowed the Federation to conduct itself there more or less autonomously, and the locals\\u2014grateful for the influx of business\\u2014rarely made trouble for their guests.\\n\\nWill Riker sensed it even before he materialized inside the zone, like a heat wave of raw emotion spilling over the border that marked the edge of friendly territory. So did Bev Crusher, who tensed the moment she came out of the matter stream, both of them taking in their surroundings to pinpoint the source. It wasn\\u2019t hard to find. An angry native crowd, milling about outside the compound, bristled at the sight of them\\u2014two more invaders to complement the dozens of others who had beamed down ahead of them as part of the advance team.\\n\\n\\u201cWarm welcome,\\u201d Bev Crusher remarked, having dropped in next to him. \\u201cThink they\\u2019ll ask us to stay for dinner?\\u201d\\n\\nRiker looked the crowd over, searching for signs of real danger. The gathering was hardly what he would have called a riot, but he could see the hate in their eyes nonetheless.\\n\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t plan on being here that long,\\u201d he replied. \\u201cCome on.\\u201d\\n\\nThe two of them made their way through a flurry of activity, toward the center of the compound where most of the action was taking place. Uniformed crewmen from Enterprise pitched in with the resident civilian researchers, taking down what was left of the complex. They loaded everything they could into the large transport containers that Riker had sent down, battering most of the equipment in their haste\\u2014not that the commander took issue. His orders on the matter had been very clear: Get in, get out, do it fast. All other considerations secondary. The only exception were the Level 5 biologicals, which Beverly was here to handle. Bad as things were, an accident involving some nasty pathogen would only make things worse\\u2014and the captain had been quite specific about not making things worse.\\n\\nHe and Beverly turned in the direction of a harried but booming voice, belonging to what could have been the fattest man Riker had ever seen. He bounded toward them faster than what should have been possible, so epic in girth that it seemed he couldn\\u2019t be human; but as he finally arrived, the man revealed himself to be just that\\u2014genteel and with a good humor that made Riker take an instant liking to him.\\n\\n\\u201cWelcome to Skid Row,\\u201d the man huffed, his face beet red but managing to squeeze out a smile between rivulets of sweat. \\u201cOr at least what\\u2019s left of it. Your people came ready to party, I\\u2019ll hand you that.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe aim to please,\\u201d Riker said, shaking his hand. \\u201cAre you Dr. Morton?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cResident xenosociologist,\\u201d Morton replied, \\u201cwhich is a fancy way of saying I don\\u2019t work for a living. Please call me Alex.\\u201d He then turned to Beverly. \\u201cNow I know what you\\u2019re thinking, Dr. Crusher\\u2014so before you whip out that tricorder, I\\u2019ll have you know that I\\u2019ve actually lost over twenty kilos since getting marooned on this rock. Check my file if you don\\u2019t believe me.\\u201d\\n\\nBeverly laughed. \\u201cThe food here must be terrible.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOne of the many things I won\\u2019t miss,\\u201d he affirmed, motioning toward their growing audience outside the compound. \\u201cYou get a chance to meet the neighbors? They\\u2019ve been a bit frisky as of late.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey\\u2019re mostly good people,\\u201d Morton continued, \\u201cbut with a few professional agitators thrown in the mix. The government likes to keep things stirred up, if you know what I mean. Makes it easier to blame outsiders for all their problems.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSo we\\u2019ve seen,\\u201d Beverly said, zipping up her jacket to ward off the early morning desert chill\\u2014but not before Morton noticed the Type II phaser holstered underneath. He didn\\u2019t appear surprised, just mildly amused.\\n\\n\\u201cSure your last name ain\\u2019t Holliday?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYou ought to see the rest of her kit,\\u201d Riker said drily. \\u201cAre any of your people armed?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAgainst the law,\\u201d Morton replied, \\u201ceven for citizens. The government also likes to keep everyone on a short leash.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cStill, it might be a good idea,\\u201d Riker decided. \\u201cI\\u2019d feel a lot better knowing we had an edge, especially if things get out of hand.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe local constabulary might take issue with that.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cFrag \\u2018em. The Bezzeret don\\u2019t get to make all the rules.\\u201d\\n\\nMorton grinned. \\u201cGlad to have you on our side, commander.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cLikewise\\u2014\\u201d Riker began, but got cut off by a piercing shriek that stabbed across the grounds. He reacted instantly, turning in the direction of the sound\\u2014knowing on an instinctive level that it wasn\\u2019t human, but recognizing the rage contained within just the same. Beverly did the same, hand dropping to her weapon as she looked back toward the entrance of the compound, where they saw a throng of Bezzeret protestors now pouring through. Riker had no idea what set them off, but at least as many Federation personnel surged in to meet them. With the two waves fast converging, God only knew what would happen when they hit.\\n\\n\\u201cDammit,\\u201d Riker seethed, heading straight into the fracas with Beverly on his six. Morton did his best to keep up, but quickly fell behind in the swell of bodies as the two officers pushed their way through. \\u201cMake a hole!\\u201d Riker shouted, barely able to hear himself over the crowd, which only grew louder and more rambunctious the deeper he went. By now, everyone was itching for a fight\\u2014himself included, even though he didn\\u2019t quite know why.\\n\\nThen he reached the center of the storm, and saw for himself.\\n\\nThere, in the no man\\u2019s land between the two opposing factions, one of Morton\\u2019s people \\u2014a woman, no less\\u2014faced off against a Bezzeret. The two circled each other, already dusted up and bloodied from more than a few traded blows. Morton\\u2019s girl held her own, though, getting some jabs in as her much taller opponent swung at her.\\n\\n\\u201cCome on, you stringy bastard,\\u201d she taunted. \\u201cThat the best you got?\\u201d\\n\\nThe Bezzeret bared his teeth, emitting a low growl\\u2014the same bestial tone Riker had heard before. The sound of it made his blood run cold, almost as much as the dull glow behind the Bezzeret\\u2019s eyes.\\n\\nAnd Riker knew: He\\u2019ll kill her if he gets the chance.\\n\\nThe woman, agile as she was, didn\\u2019t fully realize the danger. Dropping her guard only for a second, she gave the Bezzeret the opening he needed. He lunged, moving unbelievably fast, fingers hooked into claws and reaching for her neck. Somehow the woman saw it coming, and pivoted her body to the left to avoid what would have been a fatal strike. But her shoulder took the brunt instead, the impact spinning her around and stuffing her face-first into the ground. She pushed herself up, scrambling to get clear, but the Bezzeret grabbed her by the sides of the head\\u2014his powerful hands squeezing her skull, determined to crush it.\\n\\nBoth men went flying, a tangle of limbs thrashing against one another. Riker held the advantage, though, rolling away and jumping up before the dazed Bezzeret knew what was happening. He then crouched, ready to go on offense again as the Bezzeret clambered back to his feet. This time the alien hissed, an altogether demonic sound, and Riker saw the hell fire behind those eyes directed at him. Clearly, this wasn\\u2019t going to end until one of them was dead\\u2014and the crowd, now worked to an absolute frenzy, expected nothing less.\\n\\nUntil the scream of a phaser silenced them.\\n\\nThe beam struck the Bezzeret squarely in the chest, so hard that it knocked him back several meters. He crumpled to the ground a twitching mass, his body racked by stray electrical impulses, though his moans left no doubt that he was still alive. The phaser had only been set to stun\\u2014but jacked to a high enough level to hurt. Riker had to admire the shooter\\u2019s style.\\n\\nThe crowd parting, he saw Beverly level her weapon at the other protesters.\\n\\nSomething in her tone made the Bezzeret take heed. They retreated a few steps, helping their comrade up, but then regained enough courage to stand their ground. That was when Morton arrived, even more winded than before, and sized up the situation in that canny way of his. Kneeling down to assist the woman from his team, he looked up at Beverly and then towards Riker.\\n\\n\\u201cIs this what you meant by out of hand?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\nThe Bezzeret also waited on Riker\\u2019s answer. He could tell that they were on the edge, and that the slightest push could nudge them either way. He thought about drawing his own phaser, matching Beverly\\u2019s show of force, but instinct made him reconsider. This was a brawl, not a battle\\u2014and he had already seized the initiative with his fists.\\n\\n\\u201cI will have order!\\u201d he shouted, in a voice that would have made his drill instructor at the Academy proud. \\u201cYou people will disperse immediately so we can finish our work. Anybody who interferes,\\u201d he trailed off, leveling an acid scowl at the stunned Bezzeret. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve already seen what happens.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Bezzeret chattered amongst themselves, still uncertain.\\n\\n\\u201cMake it hard on us,\\u201d Riker prodded, \\u201cwe\\u2019ll make it even harder on you.\\u201d\\n\\nThey exchanged a few glances, searching for a leader. None arose.\\n\\n\\u201cSo what\\u2019s it going to be?\\u201d\\n\\nThe heat that fed the Bezzeret frenzy settled into a slow burn. Gradually, they began to disperse\\u2014including the one Beverly shot, who hobbled away with the aid of his friends, his pride wounded more than anything else. He spat at Riker\\u2019s feet as he went past, muttering something in his native language that cast a ripple of assent among the others.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\\u201d Riker asked.\\n\\n\\u201cHumans go home,\\u201d Morton translated, dusting off his knees as he and Beverly came over. They watched the Bezzeret retreat, which extended back to the compound\\u2019s perimeter, but went no farther. There they remained, like a storm hanging just off shore, replenishing their fury for next time. \\u201cIf it\\u2019s all the same to you, I\\u2019d like like to grant their wish. The best view of this place will be in the rear view mirror\\u2014preferably with a beer in hand.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI heard that,\\u201d Riker agreed, and started to walk with Beverly and Morton toward the operations shack. Enterprise had already started beaming cargo up, the large carriers dematerializing in the courtyard as they went by. \\u201cWe got the manifest for all your gear, but I\\u2019m thinking we ought to prioritize. As long as we get the vital stuff first, we can leave the rest of it behind if things deteriorate any more than they already have.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey can bill me,\\u201d the commander retorted, turning to Beverly. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s our time frame for securing the biologicals?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThree hours,\\u201d she answered. \\u201cTwo if we really push it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTwo hours,\\u201d Riker grumbled. \\u201cNot even enough time for a poker game.\\u201d It was, however, a lot more time than he wanted to spend here, with all those Bezzeret eyes watching. And the protestors outside the grounds were only the beginning. There might well be even more of them, staring down from the ramshackle buildings of Skid Row, waiting for some signal to attack. Plenty of places to hide in there, Riker thought, feeling more vulnerable than ever before. If it came down to actually defending this place, he had no idea how the hell to do it.\\n\\n\\u201cMove like you got a purpose,\\u201d he ordered.\\n\\nThe volume of computer activity that takes place on board starship is considerable. In fact, the burden placed on its computer cores are of such magnitude and importance that the use of conventional processing elements is impossible\\u2014they are simply too slow. To answer these demands, a network which makes use of optical transtator clusters made up of thousands of faster than light nanoprocessor units was developed to become the \\u201cnervous system\\u201d of a starship. In essence, the same theory which made warp drive a working reality was applied to generating a subspace field within this network, thus allowing the ship\\u2019s computer to process information at faster than light speeds. Not only did this arrangement free the designers from the confines of real space processing, it also saved a lot of headaches by eliminating the need to support the almost absolute-zero temperatures required by conventional superconductors.\\n\\nThe principle was efficient, stable and had been in use for nearly 200 years. From an engineering standpoint, there was virtually no downside\\u2014except for one possibility that nearly everyone had overlooked.\\n\\nWhen the subject of catastrophic failure came up at the original project meetings, only one scientist\\u2014a multidimensional physicist named David Zeen\\u2014pointed out that there indeed was an Achilles Heel hidden within the system. A theoretician with an obsessive-compulsive streak, Zeen worried about everything\\u2014including the possibility that a subspace pulse of a certain magnitude could wreak havoc with the isolinear processors that were central to the core\\u2019s design. If the pulse were especially strong, it could effectively wipe them clean, like an eraser being dragged across a chalkboard.\\n\\nBy this time, of course, a great deal of time and money had already been spent on the original design. Implementing safeguards against the kind of event Zeen postulated would have set the project back by several months, if not a year or more. Further undermining his argument was the simple fact that freak subspace pulses were almost unheard of in nature, outside of a supernova or the event horizon of a black hole\\u2014and if a starship ever got close enough to one of those, a computer failure would be the least of its problems. Accordingly, in true bureaucratic fashion, Zeen\\u2019s opinion was carefully noted and summarily discarded. Work proceeded on schedule and everyone went their separate ways.\\n\\nExcept that somewhere along the line, word trickled back to Starfleet Tactical. The rocket boys there had already been working on ways to screw with an enemy vessel\\u2019s warp drive by subjecting it to intense subspace fields, an effort that had yielded mixed results at best. The revelation that they could apply the same techniques more effectively to screwing with an enemy vessel\\u2019s computer\\u2014well, that seemed like the next best thing. And seeing as the department had already budgeted for the research, they didn\\u2019t need to go to the Federation for additional funding. Not only was this cost-conscious, it also allowed the admiral in charge to keep any new weapons that resulted off the books.\\n\\nSo began the development of what would become the Localized Conductive Subspace Interference Generator\\u2014LoConSIG for short, a rather clunky acronym that no one would ever use. In more vicious circles (and there were many), it was known as the Starship Killer. Euphemistically, it was called the Black Box\\u2014an overtly descriptive name, but like Pandora\\u2019s Box, one that gave no clue as to the deadly contents inside.\\n\\nIt is not a bomb, though it could be categorized as a weapon of mass destruction. A small, rectangular object, it measures 50cm by 30cm with no visible controls aside from a small programming pad on the topmost surface. The components are divided into two sub-systems: one is capable of rerouting computer systems and executing commands, while the other is a tiny but lethal static subspace field generator capable of delivering a whopping burst of 4500 millocochranes. In real time, the length of this burst is less than one-thousandth of a second\\u2014but it is enough to inflict fatal damage on a faster-than-light computer system.\\n\\nWhat David Zeen had envisioned as his worst nightmare, Tactical had made a working reality. Frightening as it was, though, the Black Box ultimately didn\\u2019t find much of a place for itself among the arsenal of more conventional weapons. Commonplace as they were, phasers and photon torpedoes could be used at a distance\\u2014you simply aimed at fired. Using the Black Box was a bit more complex, because it worked from the inside out. It had to be tied directly to a ship\\u2019s core interface, which meant someone had to beam aboard an enemy vessel to deploy it\\u2014and that, as they say, is easier said than done under combat conditions.\\n\\nWhat the Black Box could do effectively, however, was destroy a ship without leaving a trace of itself. With all of its other limitations, that left the weapon but with one real use: sabotage. Given the state of affairs in the Federation, though, and the Council\\u2019s general reluctance to authorize covert actions, that meant in all likelihood that the Black Box would spend its life gathering dust in some vault\\u2014an interesting proof of concept, but little more.\\n\\nStill, there were those who thought it wasn\\u2019t a bad thing to have around. Terrence Blake was such a man. From the moment he first saw the Black Box, he understood its potential. In fact, he had been so impressed with the device that he arranged to have several of them deployed in the field, each one in the hands of a trusted ally. It was a proactive move on his part\\u2014highly illegal, given the lack of Starfleet sanction, but a wise one nonetheless. Blake hadn\\u2019t risen up the chain of command by being caught unprepared, and the Black Box gave him an edge that nobody else had.\\n\\nBecause you never knew when you would have to destroy a ship in secret.\\n\\nEspecially one of your own.\\n\\nSteven Quintax felt strange, staring down into his empty hands. Only moments before, he had held the Black Box in them, pondering the sheer power and naked potential contained in such an innocuous package. Stranger still, he had handed it off without any hesitation at all\\u2014a transaction, more or less, like contraband between pirates, conducted in the secrecy of his quarters. Only now, left alone with his thoughts, did he begin to realize the magnitude of what he had set into motion.\\n\\nThe admiral would have done the same thing, Quintax kept telling himself. He always made the tough decisions. When he gets wind of this, he\\u2019ll know I did the right thing.\\n\\nSo why did his hands shake so badly?\\n\\nHe balled them into fists, trying to quell his angst, rocking back and forth but finding no peace in repetition. His conscience would simply not allow it\\u2014a conscience that had been notably absent in the presence of the Ponsak, who had taken the box from him and disappeared. Quintax knew where the creature was by now, though he could never fathom how; it was one of those things he chose not to question, for fear of where the answer might lead. He only knew that what he had started could not be stopped.\\n\\nAnd he would most certainly be damned for it.\\n\\nQuintax rocked some more, that thought actually giving him some measure of comfort. Perhaps hell wouldn\\u2019t be such a bad place after all\\u2014and there was a certain solace in knowing that it was his final destination. Still, Quintax couldn\\u2019t shake the image of Blake looking down at him, in pitiful disappointment: Zeus, with his all to familiar contempt for the weakness of mere mortals. Enterprise would make a fine enough burnt offering, wouldn\\u2019t she?\\n\\nQuintax, praying to his jealous god, begged for the strength to see it through.\\n\\n\\u201cThy will be done,\\u201d he whispered. \\u201cThy will be done.\\u201d\\n\\nThere was once a philosopher, not from Earth, who speculated that the nature of evil is not so much that which opposes good, but a void in which good cannot exist. Only within such a space is there room for evil, which itself is a vacuum. That which is nothingness appears from nothingness, and can thus become anything it wants to be\\u2014imparting to evil a remarkable flexibility, because it can assume any form that it wants. Good suffers from pretensions; evil does not. Accordingly, it is easy for evil to slip on past, unnoticed by human eyes, in willful blindness.\\n\\nSo it was from nothingness that the creature appeared\\u2014the same one that would haunt Steven Quintax in the few dreams that he had left, like a nightmare fringe that leaves no trace of itself in the morning, save a tingling, barely palpable sense of fear; the same creature which, because of its nature, was the perfect warrior\\u2014a thing with no name and no face and no identity, only a singularity of purpose. Like a distillation of evil, it held no pretense. And like an incarnation of evil, it walked the vessel\\u2019s corridors at the border between reality and terror, where no eye could see nor any sensor detect.\\n\\nIt heard the voices and felt the heartbeats of those it passed, taking in a brief taste of life with every encounter, watching them with a curiosity that wasn\\u2019t so much alive as it was existent. It brushed by a few of them, some even close enough to touch, perhaps stirring a detached sort of dread easily dismissed as nerves or fatigue, before moving on to its objective. Because nothing would keep it from its objective.\\n\\nThe creature was Ponsak, and this was its duty.\\n\\nThe information systems architecture of a Galaxy-class starship consists of three computer cores, two of which are located on the port and starboard sides of the primary hull, while the third resides deep within the secondary. Each provides load balancing and redundancy for its counterparts, the split arrangement also allowing the two hulls to operate independently of one another during separated flight. Although largely automated, the cores are constantly monitored by specialists posted in an adjoining substation known as Subspace Field System Access\\u2014or SFSA\\u2014which is designated as a vaulted area because of its critical importance to shipboard operations. Aside from the captain and the XO, only those assigned to SFSA are permitted to enter.\\n\\nDuty there isn\\u2019t considered the worst on board, but it comes close. The gray walls, dark lighting, mazes of isolinear chips, and the sparse interfaces don\\u2019t present a warm and welcome sight (someone once observed that the designers had hired the same interior decorator as the Borg). Coupled with the constant, semi-sentient hum radiating from the core chamber, the atmosphere seems to actively loathe any living thing that enters it. This effect is, of course, entirely psychological, but it manifests itself consistently enough so that shifts are rotated out every four hours\\u2014the shortest duration of any on board. Because of this, the rest of the crew tends to view SFSA specialists as a little squirrel y, better at talking to machines than to other human beings. The specialists, for their part, think even less of outsiders in return\\u2014but they know how to keep things running, so they rarely get asked any questions.\\n\\nUnder non-combat conditions, the job of monitoring the cores is the responsibility of a two-person team. The lead position is held by a commissioned officer, typically a lieutenant junior-grade, assisted by a petty officer second-class. Their routine is a simple one, consisting primarily of fine tuning, maintenance and watching a diagnostic feed\\u2014monkey work, as the hardcore systems jockeys liked to call it, but demanded under regulations. The rest of the time, the team functions as a backstop against any possible contingency. That\\u2019s a fancy way of saying they sit around waiting for something to go wrong\\u2014and even then, they\\u2019re a superfluous component at best. If one of the cores goes down, the others kick in automatically to take up the slack; and beyond that, if the unthinkable happened, a system of dedicated subprocessors could take over minimal operations in the event of a multiple core failure. In essence, the emergency would have occurred, been isolated, and addressed before the crew could even hit the alert button.\\n\\nBut protocol was protocol, and if it was anything that Jean-Luc Picard impressed upon his people it was the human factor involved in all phases of ship\\u2019s operations. No matter how well the engineers had designed her, Enterprise was not perfect, and it was up to her crew to remain sharp when the vessel herself couldn\\u2019t. Sure, it was a platitude\\u2014but it was an effective one, and kept people from going going batshit when it seemed like duty consisted solely of staring at a screen of endless figures and waiting for the chimes to ring so you could go up to Ten Forward and be glad that it was someone else\\u2019s turn.\\n\\nSometimes, though, it wore thin. With the skipper acting beyond strange and a general pall of tension hanging over the ship, it was easy to glance up at the clock and think an hour had passed and find that it had only been five minutes. Specialist Divers had seen more than his share of that lately, with the in-betweens stretching out so long that he had started giving serious thought to another line of work. For most crewmen, that wouldn\\u2019t have been such a big deal; griping was practically a job requirement for the enlisted man, and Divers was no exception. But he was also a console cowboy through and through, having spent his entire life immersed in the obscure digital rhythms of every computer system he could get his hands on. Hell, the reason he had joined Starfleet in the first place was to get up close and personal with heavy tech. If that particular thrill was gone then there wasn\\u2019t a hell of a lot left for him, and more than one woman on board lived in fear of where his attentions might turn next.\\n\\nLieutenant Marksen wasn\\u2019t one of them, though. A stint in security meant she knew how to put the hurt on him, so Divers knew better than to mess with her. He barely even acknowledged Marksen as she climbed up a ladder from the lower decks and slid into the chair next to him, his eyes never leaving the bank of virtual screens that hovered over his station.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re early,\\u201d she said, firing up her own set of screens.\\n\\n\\u201cGot tired of the movie they were running in the mess club.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cCouldn\\u2019t tell. They all kind of look the same.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSailor\\u2019s lament,\\u201d she sighed, hitting a button to record for the log. \\u201cMarksen, Karen J. Assuming watch, 1200 hours. Divers, Bryan T. attending. Request identity confirmation.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI do so confirm,\\u201d Divers said.\\n\\n\\u201cThank God for that,\\u201d Marksen said, closing out the entry. \\u201cFor a second there, I thought I might have to shoot you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnything to break up the routine.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNumber three just completed a self-diagnostic,\\u201d Divers told her, his hands a blur as they moved across his console. \\u201cChip alpha-tango-seven-niner in array fourteen reports an impending fail and will need replacing. Oh, and there was a minor interference pattern that briefly triggered a breach mode before the core figured out what was going on and corrected itself.\\u201d\\n\\nMarksen called up the event on her console and studied the figures for a moment.\\n\\n\\u201cWere you able to pinpoint the exact source?\\u201d she asked.\\n\\n\\u201cClose enough to make it an easy call. It\\u2019s probably just a feedback surge coming off the pings from our own substation. Back at tech we used to call it a curly ghost. We\\u2019d see them pop off from time to time.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHmm,\\u201d Marksen mused. She didn\\u2019t really sound concerned\\u2014just bored and like she was looking for any kind of relief. \\u201cWhat was the duration of the breach?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAround 1.2257853 nanoseconds\\u2014or thereabouts.\\u201d He smiled a bit, amused at the mountain she was building out of this molehill. \\u201cIt really was no big deal, lieutenant. We flood the system with maintenance traffic all the time. Some of it just came back on us and got mistaken for an outside incursion, that\\u2019s all.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019d still feel better if one of us checked it out,\\u201d she said, hopping out of her chair. \\u201cI\\u2019ll take a tricorder with me just to make sure it isn\\u2019t something that could turn into a persistent leak. Could be we\\u2019ve got some bad shielding down there.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t worry about it too much,\\u201d Divers pointed out. \\u201cThe kind of surge we\\u2019re talking about doesn\\u2019t pack enough juice to cook popcorn.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen humor me,\\u201d Marksen ordered, heading for the hatch. It opened with a little hiss as the self-contained atmosphere depressurized with the rest of the cabin. \\u201cBesides, it\\u2019s not like we have anything better to do.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSince you\\u2019re going down there anyway, should I alert engineering so that you guys can replace that faulty chip?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMight as well,\\u201d Marksen agreed. \\u201cWhy should we have all the fun?\\u201d\\n\\nAnd with a friendly salute, the lieutenant was on her way. Divers shook his head, but consoled himself knowing that at least the exercise wasn\\u2019t a complete waste of time. He rang up engineering, expecting to hear some tool pusher on the other end. Instead he got Commander La Forge, who apparently had the nasty habit of answering his own calls. Divers gave him a rundown of the situation, which actually intrigued the chief engineer\\u2014although God only knew why. La Forge got so worked up he even volunteered to meet Marksen in SFSA himself. After all, it wasn\\u2019t every day he got to play detective with a curly ghost.\\n\\nClosing out, Divers sank bank into his chair and sighed.\\n\\nOfficers, he lamented. What can you do?\\n\\nBut he had no idea of the chain of events he had just set into motion.\\n\\nThe Ponsak swam in the liquid darkness that enveloped the computer core. In complete isolation, possessing a singularity of purpose, the creature might have felt completely alone in the universe\\u2014supposing that it had the capacity to feel anything. As it was, the Ponsak merely existed as a force without reason: action and reaction, driven by pure instinct, its directives hard-coded in its DNA. It never even occurred to the creature that its appearance might have created an infinitesimal distortion in the subspace field generated by the core, or that such a disturbance could have been detected. It merely proceeded, like a virus attacking its host, aware of nothing that didn\\u2019t immediately stand in its way.\\n\\nThe core itself was mammoth, rising a full two decks from base to apex. The Ponsak circled around the cylindrical face until it found a hard-link access panel, precisely where the starship\\u2019s schematics said it would be. Opening a compartment in its body armor, the Ponsak then retrieved the small device given to it by Captain Quintax. The creature had only a rudimentary understanding of how the Black Box worked, but had memorized every detail of its deployment. As the Ponsak affixed the device to the access panel, a tiny control pad appeared on its face. With a single touch, it engaged\\u2014and began the delicate process of inserting itself through the optical interface, the very gateway into the wider network.\\n\\nThe Ponsak, for its part, waited.\\n\\nA progress indicator ticked away the seconds, rising steadily until it completed the interface. The Ponsak then drilled down through the almost endless layers of information manipulated by the core, finally locating the controls for the ship\\u2019s orbital maneuvering system. Using a preprogrammed routine, it tied the box into those controls. All that remained was to lock everything down with a complex code series\\u2014\\n\\nThe Ponsak stopped, its movements frozen to absolute zero. Senses deviating from its immediate task, the creature expanded its sphere of awareness outward in circles until it detected the source of this new threat.\\n\\nIt waited to see if the human would go past, but calculated the odds as being unlikely. This area of the ship was restricted, and those who entered had a specific reason to be here. True to logic, the human stopped outside the access hatch and dialed in a key code. The hatch then popped open with a soft hiss\\u2014but the sound may as well have been a bullet, for all the potential violence it summoned.\\n\\nRetreating farther into the shadows, the Ponsak made like a hole in the dark.\\n\\nAnd prepared its butcher\\u2019s tools for work.\\n\\nMarksen watched the hatch slide open, light spilling into the core from behind her.\\n\\nHer own shadow fell across the floor, the shape of her body elongating to ghastly proportions as it mirrored her movements\\u2014a disconcerting effect that set her nerves on edge, though she couldn\\u2019t quite fathom why. Marksen had been here dozens of times and never paid it much mind, but all of a sudden she realized how isolated this place was. A person could scream and there wouldn\\u2019t be another soul to hear it\\u2014only the stark, imposing face of the core itself, which neither understood or cared. A person could die down here, and nobody would know it for hours or even days.\\n\\nMarksen chided herself for even thinking it, but still had to suppress a shudder before she could even walk inside. The atmosphere was frigid and dry, like nighttime in the desert, except for the utter sterility of the elements therein. They seemed to draw the life from her as she breathed them in, the core responding with quickening pulses of pseudolight that coursed through its stacks of isolinear chips. The sight of it filled Marksen with a vague dread of being watched, even beckoned, while her instincts pleaded with her to go the other way.\\n\\nGet a hold of yourself.\\n\\nOnly then did Marksen realize that she had been standing by the open doorway, no more than two steps in, steadying herself against the closest bulkhead. The droning of the ship filled her ears, giving her a handle on reality, and Marksen allowed it to clear her head. Reminding herself why she was here, she then reached for the tricorder she had picked up on her way down, peeling it off her belt and feeling the weight of it in her hands. It felt good and solid\\u2014a simple piece of tech, which answered with an affirmative tone as she flipped open the cover.\\n\\nJust get it done, she thought, and started scanning.\\n\\nThe tiny screen bathed her face in a pale green glow, the readings that appeared there strangely comforting. They didn\\u2019t show her much that she didn\\u2019t already know: the strong, proximal curve of a subspace field, modulations of energy states that propagated data along FTL routes\\u2014but all of it was neatly contained, with not a stray impulse to be found. Not a single sign of the \\u201ccurly ghost\\u201d Divers had described.\\n\\nThe voice jolted Marksen so hard she nearly dropped the tricorder. Clutching the device to her chest, she abruptly turned to see Commander La Forge approaching from the outside corridor. He ran to her side and took her by the arm, the concern on his face apparent even behind the VISOR that covered his eyes.\\n\\n\\u201cTake it easy there,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou okay?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d she blurted, still catching her breath. \\u201cSorry about that, commander. I must be a little jumpy today.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI have that affect on people.\\u201d\\n\\nMarksen laughed. Aside from Divers, Geordi La Forge was probably the least threatening man she knew\\u2014a fact only underscored by the warm smile he showed her. \\u201cTalk about weird,\\u201d she said, her fear dissipating to a tingle now that she was no longer alone. \\u201cYou ever walk into a room and just get the creeps?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou are ghost hunting,\\u201d La Forge told her, putting down a tool box that he had brought with him. \\u201cAnd let\\u2019s just say that I\\u2019ve seen a few corners of this ship that would make a great spot for a Halloween party.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cCount me in on the next one.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJust don\\u2019t tell the captain,\\u201d he joked. \\u201cSo did you find anything?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNot a whole a lot,\\u201d Marksen replied, handing him the tricorder. \\u201cShielding looks good, though we might be getting sporadic leaks off that faulty chip.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGood an explanation as any,\\u201d the chief engineer agreed, handing the device back. \\u201cStill, the tricorder can miss readings at the extreme ends of the subspace spectrum.\\u201d He tapped the side of his VISOR. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why I like to eyeball it.\\u201d\\n\\nMarksen smiled, and watched curiously as La Forge did his own scan of the area around the core. Methodically, he turned his gaze from one end to the other, moving in sweeps so that he could take it all in. \\u201cSo far so good,\\u201d he observed. \\u201cWhich array was giving you a problem?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s topside,\\u201d La Forge said, craning to get a look near the ceiling. \\u201cIf that is the source, then it should stand out pretty clear against the conventional EM\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nThe pause was unnatural. It filled the space between them with a mounting silence, building on an exponential curve. Marksen felt a stab of terror, sudden and irresistible\\u2014but not from within. This time it was real, and coming from the direction of La Forge\\u2019s stare.\\n\\nThe engineer frowned. \\u201cWhat the hell is that?\\u201d\\n\\nAnd with blinding speed, the terror fell upon them.\\n\\nLa Forge heard himself shout a warning out to Marksen, right before something savage clawed at him from out of the dark. The impact struck him squarely in the side of the head, reanimating his optic nerves with a bloom of stars and pain as it ripped his VISOR loose. He felt his forehead opening up like a seam, blood pouring into his useless eyes, his hands going up in front of his face in a useless attempt to protect himself. By, then, however, his attacker had moved on to other targets. Two quick jabs to his abdomen made him double over, gasping for breath, before another blow knocked his legs out from under him. La Forge crumpled, crashing into the deck so hard he could hear his bones rattle.\\n\\nThe most amazing force clamped down on the sides of his head. La Forge felt fingers digging into his skull, though it seemed impossible that anyone could be that strong. Fresh pain seeped into his brain like a hot flood, the rest of his body trivial by comparison. Unable to think, he reacted on instinct, tearing at the hands that held him\\u2014but then recoiled against them, so violently that he gagged. The touch was so monstrous, so reptilian, it branded him as unclean even as it squeezed the life out of him.\\n\\noh god oh dear god this thing\\u2019s not alive\\n\\nthis thing holding me touching me is not alive it\\u2019s dead\\n\\nA woman\\u2019s voice: \\u201cDivers! Emergency! We have an intruder\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nThe hands let go, dropping him to the floor.\\n\\nLa Forge heaved, spitting out blood as he rolled onto his side. Conscious thought pierced his mind like a hot lance, matching the agony that his body felt. Why hadn\\u2019t his attacker killed him? It would have been so easy, and La Forge would have welcomed it.\\n\\nThen he heard Marksen screaming, and the reason because crystal.\\n\\nHe groped for the device in a clumsy stupor, fingers dragging across the deck and tearing out his nails. La Forge paid it no heed. The only thing worse than facing the walking dead was facing it in blindness\\u2014and knowing that it had dispensed with him only to go after Marksen. The nightmare of having to sit and listen while that thing did to her what it did to him swelled up in his imagination like a tsunami rolling into shore, because in his mind\\u2019s eye he wouldn\\u2019t be blind at all. Because in his mind\\u2019s eye his imagination would see everything\\u2014\\n\\nThen a slow, gurgling sound. The snapping of wet twigs.\\n\\nLa Forge froze. The silence of the grave descended upon him.\\n\\n\\u201cLieutenant?\\u201d he called, reaching a hand out into the void.\\n\\nA blast of warm, viscous droplets sprayed La Forge in the face. He didn\\u2019t need to see it or taste it to know what it was. The sound of Marksen\\u2019s body, collapsing in a heap next to him, only confirmed that this blood was not his own.\\n\\nBut it would be soon enough. The walking dead would see to that.\\n\\nLa Forge opened up his soul and screamed.\\n\\nSecurity got the call from a frantic crewman. The ship\\u2019s computer routed it to the nearest standby team, where a master chief by the name of Costa answered. He listened closely, trying hard just to make out the crewman\\u2019s name\\u2014Danvers or something like that\\u2014but the voice on the other end was terrified beyond comprehension, babbling so fast that the chief barely understood. He only managed to pick out bits and pieces, fragmented by the sound of a battering ram against a steel door\\u2014until a loud screech burst in, and the voice shouted for the last time.\\n\\nThen the channel cut out. Static and then silence.\\n\\nCosta jumped onto a nearby console, tracing the call to its point of origin. His display highlighted a small area on Deck 31, identifying the section: Subspace Field Systems Access. He tried to raise the crewman again, but nobody answered. That was all Costa needed to know.\\n\\nAlerting the squad on duty, he went over to the armory and punched an access code into the electronic lock. The door slid open as his people arrived, all ten of them filing in one at a time and outfitting themselves with the required equipment: Type II handheld phasers for everyone, with a Type I for use as a backup. Costa did the same, strapping the weapons to his belt and heading out after them\\u2014but then stopped when something else caught his eye.\\n\\nThere, bolted to the wall, was a heavy phaser rifle. The chief thought about it for a moment, remembering the sheer terror he heard in that voice.\\n\\n\\u201cScrew it,\\u201d he said, and grabbed the rifle.\\n\\nAs Costa walked back into the security station, the others noticed the firepower he had slung over his shoulder. They all exchanged the same look, and knew it was bad.\\n\\n\\u201cTime to earn that paycheck,\\u201d the chief said, and led them out to fight.\\n\\nThe Ponsak ran like the devil, no longer concerned with remaining invisible. Anyone it encountered now would be killed\\u2014the equation was as simple as that. Its first priority had been to neutralize the crewman in SFSA. The woman in the core had managed to warn him before the Ponsak disposed of her, creating the very real danger that the core would be taken offline before the Black Box could be fully activated. With SFSA secured, that was no longer a possibility. But there was still the matter of the Box itself, which was not yet ready. With security on the way, the Ponsak had only minutes to complete its mission. After that, it had only to defend its position\\u2014which it would do to the death.\\n\\nIt slipped back into the confines of the core, bypassing the human who still lived. The Ponsak had quickly decided that the human was a minimal threat at this point, and that even the scant few seconds required to finish him off was too much of a delay. Instead, it bounded up the side of the wall like a gigantic insect, once more up toward the ceiling where the Black Box waited. Only a few more keystrokes and its very existence would be complete.\\n\\nAnd it would have all the time in the world to kill.\\n\\nLieutenant Worf routed an Enterprise schematic to the bridge\\u2019s main viewscreen, which showed the engineering core flashing in red. Immediately around it, section dividers also flashed yellow, showing the areas being secured by approaching forces. The Klingon had wasted no time assigning full complements\\u2014not after hearing the distress call. Captain Picard, for his part, hadn\\u2019t argued with him.\\n\\n\\u201cAll security teams reporting in,\\u201d Worf said, reading off his panel. \\u201cDecks 30 through 37 have been evacuated to within five sections of the computer core.\\u201d\\n\\nPicard walked up the ramp that led to the rear of the bridge, joining Worf at the tactical station. The captain watched as moving green dots, which represented each member of the teams, approached the core from both fore and aft on all seven decks. They formed a perimeter around the evacuated sections and then stopped.\\n\\n\\u201cYes. Specialist David Divers, the one who made the call to security\\u2014and Lieutenant Sharon Marksen, who was also on the core duty roster.\\u201d Worf paused for a long moment, and then finally added, \\u201cEngineering reports that Lieutenant Commander La Forge went there ten minutes ago. He is not responding to calls.\\u201d\\n\\nMy God, Picard thought, but kept it to himself. He ran over the scenarios, none of them good. Sensors were useless around the core because the shielding there was too thick, so there was no way to tell if any of them were alive; and even if they were, beaming them out of there was out of the question for the very same reason. Picard shuddered at the thought of what he had to do next\\u2014but as captain, he knew there was no other way to protect the safety of his ship.\\n\\nAt least until we know what the hell is going on.\\n\\n\\u201cEngage the emergency doors,\\u201d he ordered. \\u201cSeal off all sections within the evacuation perimeter. Nobody but the security teams goes in or out.\\u201d\\n\\nCosta read the words stenciled into the bulkhead, the stark, bold lettering that he had seen a hundred times before now conveying the malevolence of the unknown. He signaled for his people to stop, then leveled the sights of his phaser rifle down the short distance that remained between him and SFSA. Tight sweeps on the infra-red detected nothing but empty space, the motion sensor keyed to his spyglass totally still. Even so, the sensor on the back of Costa\\u2019s neck tingled\\u2014and he trusted that a hell of a lot more than any electronic gear. Something was out there, taunting him and daring him to enter.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s right. I can see you but you can\\u2019t see me.\\n\\nHe took a step forward, clinging as close as he could to the wall. Out in front of him, the corridor bent to the left, cutting off his line of sight just short of the hatch that marked his objective.\\n\\nI could be anywhere. Maybe right next to you.\\n\\n\\u201cDammit,\\u201d Costa swore under his breath. He repositioned himself, rifle trained on the kill zone in front of him, but there was no way of seeing without sticking his head out. After that, it was all or nothing.\\n\\nIf you make it that far. If I don\\u2019t take your head off first\\u2026\\n\\nThe chief blinked the sweat from his eyes. Behind him, spaced about two meters apart, the other members of his team took cover behind the archways that led back toward the turbolift. All of them stood at the ready, their bodies like tight coils poised to strike, phasers leveled to give maximum protection to the man walking point. Costa trusted them with his life, and knew they would take down any threat before it could get close to him\\u2014but still, this felt like something else. This felt like something different.\\n\\nThe team stood by, waiting for Costa to make a decision.\\n\\nSteeling his will, the chief thrust himself out in the open. He already had a heavy pull on his rifle\\u2019s trigger, imagining the hell of phaser fire he would unleash on the first thing that twitched\\u2014but when nothing materialized, he gave the rest of the team the signal to go in. Moving in two-by-two formations, they quickly followed Costa\\u2019s lead and closed the last few meters to SFSA. There, they formed a tight cordon, weapons leveled at the entrance.\\n\\nCosta didn\\u2019t even need to look back at his team to know they were ready.\\n\\nOne step at a time, he inched over to the hatch\\u2014or what was left of it. Once a heavy, pressurized door, it had been dented inwards by some incredible force. Costa couldn\\u2019t spot any blast marks, which meant someone had gone in the hard way. He tried not to think about what could cause that kind of damage, though even his rifle now seemed like a piss poor defense against whatever it was. More than that, it would be a goddamn miracle if they could keep this thing contained.\\n\\nHolding his breath, Costa reached out and gave the door a push.\\n\\nIt swung in, giving some resistance on the other side. He tried again, harder this time, but it still wouldn\\u2019t give way. Motioning to the others, Costa positioned two of them on both sides of the entryway. Then, stepping back with his weapon at the ready, he had one of them give the door a pull. It opened slowly with a long, mournful groan\\u2014a sound like the rusted hinges of a mausoleum, with the smell of death closely behind it.\\n\\nAnd a body spilled out into the corridor.\\n\\nCosta jumped back, as the corpse\\u2019s arm flopped down near his boots. It was the only part that still looked remotely human. The rest looked like it had gone through a shredder, the remains of its uniform sliced to ribbons along with the flesh beneath. What remained of the face was even less recognizable, having been pried off and leaving behind a mostly empty skull\\u2014as if some savage hand had simply reached in and scooped it out. Worse that that, however, was the utter lack of blood. All of the wounds had been neatly cauterized, adding an insane sterility to the unspeakable violence.\\n\\nStepping over the body, the chief jammed the business end of his rifle into the confined space beyond the door. In less than two seconds, he confirmed that SFSA was secure. Whatever had carved up the poor bastard had moved on. He then went back and plucked the comm badge off the dead man\\u2019s chest, reading the name embossed on the device.\\n\\n\\u201cDivers,\\u201d Costa said. \\u201cMust be the guy who phoned it in.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGot us a bad one,\\u201d someone else added. \\u201cWhat is this thing, chief?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m more worried about where it is.\\u201d Costa tried sensors again, picking up signatures on every member of his team, but beyond that only noise. Giving up on that line, he tuned his own senses to the air: electricity infused with fear, the kind of thing that made his hairs stand on end. It was still around\\u2014of that he was certain.\\n\\nCosta also knew he had to draw it out.\\n\\nUnless I draw you out first.\\n\\nAnd then, from a short distance away, something else.\\n\\nEveryone tensed. Everyone heard it\\u2014but the words had been so weak, so ephemeral, that belief came hard. Only dead silence could coax that sound back from the deep, and when they heard it again there was no room for doubt.\\n\\nCosta shot a glance down the corridor, in the direction of that plea. There was only one possible place from which it could have come.\\n\\n\\u201cThe core,\\u201d he told the others, and ran toward it.\\n\\nAlert lights flashed above the entrance to the computer core, conspiring with the darkness inside to create a hellish red glow. Costa detected the smell of charred flesh as the team approached, a smoky haze still hanging heavy over the entirety of the section. Costa went in first, crouching in a defensive position while the others poured in behind him. And there, as his eyes adjusted to the gloom, he took in the full scale of what had happened.\\n\\nThe core was a veritable chamber of horrors.\\n\\nUnlike the comparatively clean kill back in SFSA, this place had been rendered in an orgy of blood. Spatter was everywhere, forming helter-skelter patterns on the walls and chip arrays, more blood than seemed possible in a dozen human bodies. Costa swallowed his own gag reflex, trying to stay sharp as he swept the much larger space for signs of movement. He stopped suddenly on one area of the bulkhead, thinking he saw the outline of a person\\u2014until he realized with sickening clarity that the shape had been blasted there in an outline of gore and loose tissue. Beneath that, he found the source: two more corpses, laying in a viscous, spreading pool that appeared more black than red.\\n\\nExcept that one of them stirred.\\n\\nThe chief moved in. He checked the body that didn\\u2019t move\\u2014a woman laying face down on the deck\\u2014and quickly determined that she was dead. He then went to the other one\\u2014a man with an engineering insignia, the pins on his collar indicating a rank of lieutenant commander. Only when Costa turned him over did he see the milky white of the man\\u2019s eyes, his features bruised but unmistakable.\\n\\n\\u201cCommander La Forge,\\u201d Costa told him. \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay. We\\u2019ve got you.\\u201d\\n\\nLa Forge\\u2019s useless eyes fluttered, his head lolling back and forth.\\n\\n\\u201cNo, no, no,\\u201d the chief engineer babbled, half delirious. \\u201cNo, it can\\u2019t be. This can\\u2019t be happening. Lieutenant Marksen\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re here to help,\\u201d Costa said, trying to calm him down. \\u201cBut we need to get you out of here first.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd Costa had to know.\\n\\nLa Forge slumped back, and spoke in a voice that was not his own.\\n\\nThe chief felt La Forge\\u2019s shock drain into him. From there it filled the entire core, like tentacles wrapping around each member of his team, the living only one heartbeat removed from the dead. Somehow, one of them found the commander\\u2019s VISOR and handed it to Costa. Turning the thing over in his hands, Costa could only imagine the horrors it had drilled into La Forge\\u2019s brain before coming off.\\n\\nBut La Forge wanted it back. He reached for it, knowing it was there.\\n\\nCosta gave the VISOR to him. La Forge snapped it into place, and a moment rose to his own two feet. He refused help, instead steadying himself against the bulkhead until he regained some of his strength. No longer blind, no longer tentative, he then straightened himself out and took in everything around him.\\n\\nThe security team, watching him in trepidation.\\n\\nThe woman\\u2019s body, still in death but by no means peaceful.\\n\\nAnd finally himself, his uniform soaked in blood.\\n\\nBut none of that could compare. Not to the realization of horror that dawned across La Forge\\u2019s face, manifesting itself in a slow, deliberate turn toward the doorway. Costa followed that gaze, as did the others, to find them all trapped\\u2014blocked by a figure more shadow than substance, but unquestionably real in its intentions. It appeared humanoid, but Costa knew better. This was the devil of which La Forge spoke, revealing itself in full.\\n\\nAnd pulled the trigger while he still could.\", \"author\": \"Marc Giller\", \"url\": \"https://noqreport.com/2020/01/27/star-trek-shadow-prime-book-i-chapter-11/\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 15:00:42 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580155242, \"collection_utc\": 1580172402}",News,1580155242

If you\\u2019ve ever wondered what Star Trek would be like as a modern, Tom Clancy-esque techno-thriller, you\\u2019ve come to the right place. Just in case you\\u2019ve missed the previous installments, you can find them here:\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, if you like this book and want to see it in print, ping Simon & Schuster and Pocket Books on social media and let them know!\\n\\nThe small patch of real estate carved out of the south side of the metroplex had been set aside by the Bezzeret as the Federation\\u2019s operational zone (called OZ on the official maps), but to the small community of scientists and support personnel who lived there it was known as Skid Row\\u2014a modest collection of modular buildings, each one indistinguishable from the others, deposited there by the Starfleet Corps of Engineers when they cobbled the facilities together eight years ago. In that time they had not aged well, taking on the characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood\\u2014a rather seedy part of town as those things went in this day and age, populated by the lower-caste types that always seemed to exist at the fringes of an industrial society, doing the menial jobs that the upper caste would just as soon forget. Flanked by distribution hubs and warehouses, the place didn\\u2019t have much going for it\\u2014just a few shops that sold cheap knock-off goods to offworlders and a dive bar that passed itself off as an exotic cabaret; but the Bezzeret allowed the Federation to conduct itself there more or less autonomously, and the locals\\u2014grateful for the influx of business\\u2014rarely made trouble for their guests.\\n\\nWill Riker sensed it even before he materialized inside the zone, like a heat wave of raw emotion spilling over the border that marked the edge of friendly territory. So did Bev Crusher, who tensed the moment she came out of the matter stream, both of them taking in their surroundings to pinpoint the source. It wasn\\u2019t hard to find. An angry native crowd, milling about outside the compound, bristled at the sight of them\\u2014two more invaders to complement the dozens of others who had beamed down ahead of them as part of the advance team.\\n\\n\\u201cWarm welcome,\\u201d Bev Crusher remarked, having dropped in next to him. \\u201cThink they\\u2019ll ask us to stay for dinner?\\u201d\\n\\nRiker looked the crowd over, searching for signs of real danger. The gathering was hardly what he would have called a riot, but he could see the hate in their eyes nonetheless.\\n\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t plan on being here that long,\\u201d he replied. \\u201cCome on.\\u201d\\n\\nThe two of them made their way through a flurry of activity, toward the center of the compound where most of the action was taking place. Uniformed crewmen from Enterprise pitched in with the resident civilian researchers, taking down what was left of the complex. They loaded everything they could into the large transport containers that Riker had sent down, battering most of the equipment in their haste\\u2014not that the commander took issue. His orders on the matter had been very clear: Get in, get out, do it fast. All other considerations secondary. The only exception were the Level 5 biologicals, which Beverly was here to handle. Bad as things were, an accident involving some nasty pathogen would only make things worse\\u2014and the captain had been quite specific about not making things worse.\\n\\nHe and Beverly turned in the direction of a harried but booming voice, belonging to what could have been the fattest man Riker had ever seen. He bounded toward them faster than what should have been possible, so epic in girth that it seemed he couldn\\u2019t be human; but as he finally arrived, the man revealed himself to be just that\\u2014genteel and with a good humor that made Riker take an instant liking to him.\\n\\n\\u201cWelcome to Skid Row,\\u201d the man huffed, his face beet red but managing to squeeze out a smile between rivulets of sweat. \\u201cOr at least what\\u2019s left of it. Your people came ready to party, I\\u2019ll hand you that.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe aim to please,\\u201d Riker said, shaking his hand. \\u201cAre you Dr. Morton?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cResident xenosociologist,\\u201d Morton replied, \\u201cwhich is a fancy way of saying I don\\u2019t work for a living. Please call me Alex.\\u201d He then turned to Beverly. \\u201cNow I know what you\\u2019re thinking, Dr. Crusher\\u2014so before you whip out that tricorder, I\\u2019ll have you know that I\\u2019ve actually lost over twenty kilos since getting marooned on this rock. Check my file if you don\\u2019t believe me.\\u201d\\n\\nBeverly laughed. \\u201cThe food here must be terrible.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOne of the many things I won\\u2019t miss,\\u201d he affirmed, motioning toward their growing audience outside the compound. \\u201cYou get a chance to meet the neighbors? They\\u2019ve been a bit frisky as of late.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey\\u2019re mostly good people,\\u201d Morton continued, \\u201cbut with a few professional agitators thrown in the mix. The government likes to keep things stirred up, if you know what I mean. Makes it easier to blame outsiders for all their problems.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSo we\\u2019ve seen,\\u201d Beverly said, zipping up her jacket to ward off the early morning desert chill\\u2014but not before Morton noticed the Type II phaser holstered underneath. He didn\\u2019t appear surprised, just mildly amused.\\n\\n\\u201cSure your last name ain\\u2019t Holliday?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYou ought to see the rest of her kit,\\u201d Riker said drily. \\u201cAre any of your people armed?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAgainst the law,\\u201d Morton replied, \\u201ceven for citizens. The government also likes to keep everyone on a short leash.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cStill, it might be a good idea,\\u201d Riker decided. \\u201cI\\u2019d feel a lot better knowing we had an edge, especially if things get out of hand.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe local constabulary might take issue with that.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cFrag \\u2018em. The Bezzeret don\\u2019t get to make all the rules.\\u201d\\n\\nMorton grinned. \\u201cGlad to have you on our side, commander.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cLikewise\\u2014\\u201d Riker began, but got cut off by a piercing shriek that stabbed across the grounds. He reacted instantly, turning in the direction of the sound\\u2014knowing on an instinctive level that it wasn\\u2019t human, but recognizing the rage contained within just the same. Beverly did the same, hand dropping to her weapon as she looked back toward the entrance of the compound, where they saw a throng of Bezzeret protestors now pouring through. Riker had no idea what set them off, but at least as many Federation personnel surged in to meet them. With the two waves fast converging, God only knew what would happen when they hit.\\n\\n\\u201cDammit,\\u201d Riker seethed, heading straight into the fracas with Beverly on his six. Morton did his best to keep up, but quickly fell behind in the swell of bodies as the two officers pushed their way through. \\u201cMake a hole!\\u201d Riker shouted, barely able to hear himself over the crowd, which only grew louder and more rambunctious the deeper he went. By now, everyone was itching for a fight\\u2014himself included, even though he didn\\u2019t quite know why.\\n\\nThen he reached the center of the storm, and saw for himself.\\n\\nThere, in the no man\\u2019s land between the two opposing factions, one of Morton\\u2019s people \\u2014a woman, no less\\u2014faced off against a Bezzeret. The two circled each other, already dusted up and bloodied from more than a few traded blows. Morton\\u2019s girl held her own, though, getting some jabs in as her much taller opponent swung at her.\\n\\n\\u201cCome on, you stringy bastard,\\u201d she taunted. \\u201cThat the best you got?\\u201d\\n\\nThe Bezzeret bared his teeth, emitting a low growl\\u2014the same bestial tone Riker had heard before. The sound of it made his blood run cold, almost as much as the dull glow behind the Bezzeret\\u2019s eyes.\\n\\nAnd Riker knew: He\\u2019ll kill her if he gets the chance.\\n\\nThe woman, agile as she was, didn\\u2019t fully realize the danger. Dropping her guard only for a second, she gave the Bezzeret the opening he needed. He lunged, moving unbelievably fast, fingers hooked into claws and reaching for her neck. Somehow the woman saw it coming, and pivoted her body to the left to avoid what would have been a fatal strike. But her shoulder took the brunt instead, the impact spinning her around and stuffing her face-first into the ground. She pushed herself up, scrambling to get clear, but the Bezzeret grabbed her by the sides of the head\\u2014his powerful hands squeezing her skull, determined to crush it.\\n\\nBoth men went flying, a tangle of limbs thrashing against one another. Riker held the advantage, though, rolling away and jumping up before the dazed Bezzeret knew what was happening. He then crouched, ready to go on offense again as the Bezzeret clambered back to his feet. This time the alien hissed, an altogether demonic sound, and Riker saw the hell fire behind those eyes directed at him. Clearly, this wasn\\u2019t going to end until one of them was dead\\u2014and the crowd, now worked to an absolute frenzy, expected nothing less.\\n\\nUntil the scream of a phaser silenced them.\\n\\nThe beam struck the Bezzeret squarely in the chest, so hard that it knocked him back several meters. He crumpled to the ground a twitching mass, his body racked by stray electrical impulses, though his moans left no doubt that he was still alive. The phaser had only been set to stun\\u2014but jacked to a high enough level to hurt. Riker had to admire the shooter\\u2019s style.\\n\\nThe crowd parting, he saw Beverly level her weapon at the other protesters.\\n\\nSomething in her tone made the Bezzeret take heed. They retreated a few steps, helping their comrade up, but then regained enough courage to stand their ground. That was when Morton arrived, even more winded than before, and sized up the situation in that canny way of his. Kneeling down to assist the woman from his team, he looked up at Beverly and then towards Riker.\\n\\n\\u201cIs this what you meant by out of hand?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\nThe Bezzeret also waited on Riker\\u2019s answer. He could tell that they were on the edge, and that the slightest push could nudge them either way. He thought about drawing his own phaser, matching Beverly\\u2019s show of force, but instinct made him reconsider. This was a brawl, not a battle\\u2014and he had already seized the initiative with his fists.\\n\\n\\u201cI will have order!\\u201d he shouted, in a voice that would have made his drill instructor at the Academy proud. \\u201cYou people will disperse immediately so we can finish our work. Anybody who interferes,\\u201d he trailed off, leveling an acid scowl at the stunned Bezzeret. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve already seen what happens.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Bezzeret chattered amongst themselves, still uncertain.\\n\\n\\u201cMake it hard on us,\\u201d Riker prodded, \\u201cwe\\u2019ll make it even harder on you.\\u201d\\n\\nThey exchanged a few glances, searching for a leader. None arose.\\n\\n\\u201cSo what\\u2019s it going to be?\\u201d\\n\\nThe heat that fed the Bezzeret frenzy settled into a slow burn. Gradually, they began to disperse\\u2014including the one Beverly shot, who hobbled away with the aid of his friends, his pride wounded more than anything else. He spat at Riker\\u2019s feet as he went past, muttering something in his native language that cast a ripple of assent among the others.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\\u201d Riker asked.\\n\\n\\u201cHumans go home,\\u201d Morton translated, dusting off his knees as he and Beverly came over. They watched the Bezzeret retreat, which extended back to the compound\\u2019s perimeter, but went no farther. There they remained, like a storm hanging just off shore, replenishing their fury for next time. \\u201cIf it\\u2019s all the same to you, I\\u2019d like like to grant their wish. The best view of this place will be in the rear view mirror\\u2014preferably with a beer in hand.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI heard that,\\u201d Riker agreed, and started to walk with Beverly and Morton toward the operations shack. Enterprise had already started beaming cargo up, the large carriers dematerializing in the courtyard as they went by. \\u201cWe got the manifest for all your gear, but I\\u2019m thinking we ought to prioritize. As long as we get the vital stuff first, we can leave the rest of it behind if things deteriorate any more than they already have.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey can bill me,\\u201d the commander retorted, turning to Beverly. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s our time frame for securing the biologicals?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThree hours,\\u201d she answered. \\u201cTwo if we really push it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTwo hours,\\u201d Riker grumbled. \\u201cNot even enough time for a poker game.\\u201d It was, however, a lot more time than he wanted to spend here, with all those Bezzeret eyes watching. And the protestors outside the grounds were only the beginning. There might well be even more of them, staring down from the ramshackle buildings of Skid Row, waiting for some signal to attack. Plenty of places to hide in there, Riker thought, feeling more vulnerable than ever before. If it came down to actually defending this place, he had no idea how the hell to do it.\\n\\n\\u201cMove like you got a purpose,\\u201d he ordered.\\n\\nThe volume of computer activity that takes place on board starship is considerable. In fact, the burden placed on its computer cores are of such magnitude and importance that the use of conventional processing elements is impossible\\u2014they are simply too slow. To answer these demands, a network which makes use of optical transtator clusters made up of thousands of faster than light nanoprocessor units was developed to become the \\u201cnervous system\\u201d of a starship. In essence, the same theory which made warp drive a working reality was applied to generating a subspace field within this network, thus allowing the ship\\u2019s computer to process information at faster than light speeds. Not only did this arrangement free the designers from the confines of real space processing, it also saved a lot of headaches by eliminating the need to support the almost absolute-zero temperatures required by conventional superconductors.\\n\\nThe principle was efficient, stable and had been in use for nearly 200 years. From an engineering standpoint, there was virtually no downside\\u2014except for one possibility that nearly everyone had overlooked.\\n\\nWhen the subject of catastrophic failure came up at the original project meetings, only one scientist\\u2014a multidimensional physicist named David Zeen\\u2014pointed out that there indeed was an Achilles Heel hidden within the system. A theoretician with an obsessive-compulsive streak, Zeen worried about everything\\u2014including the possibility that a subspace pulse of a certain magnitude could wreak havoc with the isolinear processors that were central to the core\\u2019s design. If the pulse were especially strong, it could effectively wipe them clean, like an eraser being dragged across a chalkboard.\\n\\nBy this time, of course, a great deal of time and money had already been spent on the original design. Implementing safeguards against the kind of event Zeen postulated would have set the project back by several months, if not a year or more. Further undermining his argument was the simple fact that freak subspace pulses were almost unheard of in nature, outside of a supernova or the event horizon of a black hole\\u2014and if a starship ever got close enough to one of those, a computer failure would be the least of its problems. Accordingly, in true bureaucratic fashion, Zeen\\u2019s opinion was carefully noted and summarily discarded. Work proceeded on schedule and everyone went their separate ways.\\n\\nExcept that somewhere along the line, word trickled back to Starfleet Tactical. The rocket boys there had already been working on ways to screw with an enemy vessel\\u2019s warp drive by subjecting it to intense subspace fields, an effort that had yielded mixed results at best. The revelation that they could apply the same techniques more effectively to screwing with an enemy vessel\\u2019s computer\\u2014well, that seemed like the next best thing. And seeing as the department had already budgeted for the research, they didn\\u2019t need to go to the Federation for additional funding. Not only was this cost-conscious, it also allowed the admiral in charge to keep any new weapons that resulted off the books.\\n\\nSo began the development of what would become the Localized Conductive Subspace Interference Generator\\u2014LoConSIG for short, a rather clunky acronym that no one would ever use. In more vicious circles (and there were many), it was known as the Starship Killer. Euphemistically, it was called the Black Box\\u2014an overtly descriptive name, but like Pandora\\u2019s Box, one that gave no clue as to the deadly contents inside.\\n\\nIt is not a bomb, though it could be categorized as a weapon of mass destruction. A small, rectangular object, it measures 50cm by 30cm with no visible controls aside from a small programming pad on the topmost surface. The components are divided into two sub-systems: one is capable of rerouting computer systems and executing commands, while the other is a tiny but lethal static subspace field generator capable of delivering a whopping burst of 4500 millocochranes. In real time, the length of this burst is less than one-thousandth of a second\\u2014but it is enough to inflict fatal damage on a faster-than-light computer system.\\n\\nWhat David Zeen had envisioned as his worst nightmare, Tactical had made a working reality. Frightening as it was, though, the Black Box ultimately didn\\u2019t find much of a place for itself among the arsenal of more conventional weapons. Commonplace as they were, phasers and photon torpedoes could be used at a distance\\u2014you simply aimed at fired. Using the Black Box was a bit more complex, because it worked from the inside out. It had to be tied directly to a ship\\u2019s core interface, which meant someone had to beam aboard an enemy vessel to deploy it\\u2014and that, as they say, is easier said than done under combat conditions.\\n\\nWhat the Black Box could do effectively, however, was destroy a ship without leaving a trace of itself. With all of its other limitations, that left the weapon but with one real use: sabotage. Given the state of affairs in the Federation, though, and the Council\\u2019s general reluctance to authorize covert actions, that meant in all likelihood that the Black Box would spend its life gathering dust in some vault\\u2014an interesting proof of concept, but little more.\\n\\nStill, there were those who thought it wasn\\u2019t a bad thing to have around. Terrence Blake was such a man. From the moment he first saw the Black Box, he understood its potential. In fact, he had been so impressed with the device that he arranged to have several of them deployed in the field, each one in the hands of a trusted ally. It was a proactive move on his part\\u2014highly illegal, given the lack of Starfleet sanction, but a wise one nonetheless. Blake hadn\\u2019t risen up the chain of command by being caught unprepared, and the Black Box gave him an edge that nobody else had.\\n\\nBecause you never knew when you would have to destroy a ship in secret.\\n\\nEspecially one of your own.\\n\\nSteven Quintax felt strange, staring down into his empty hands. Only moments before, he had held the Black Box in them, pondering the sheer power and naked potential contained in such an innocuous package. Stranger still, he had handed it off without any hesitation at all\\u2014a transaction, more or less, like contraband between pirates, conducted in the secrecy of his quarters. Only now, left alone with his thoughts, did he begin to realize the magnitude of what he had set into motion.\\n\\nThe admiral would have done the same thing, Quintax kept telling himself. He always made the tough decisions. When he gets wind of this, he\\u2019ll know I did the right thing.\\n\\nSo why did his hands shake so badly?\\n\\nHe balled them into fists, trying to quell his angst, rocking back and forth but finding no peace in repetition. His conscience would simply not allow it\\u2014a conscience that had been notably absent in the presence of the Ponsak, who had taken the box from him and disappeared. Quintax knew where the creature was by now, though he could never fathom how; it was one of those things he chose not to question, for fear of where the answer might lead. He only knew that what he had started could not be stopped.\\n\\nAnd he would most certainly be damned for it.\\n\\nQuintax rocked some more, that thought actually giving him some measure of comfort. Perhaps hell wouldn\\u2019t be such a bad place after all\\u2014and there was a certain solace in knowing that it was his final destination. Still, Quintax couldn\\u2019t shake the image of Blake looking down at him, in pitiful disappointment: Zeus, with his all to familiar contempt for the weakness of mere mortals. Enterprise would make a fine enough burnt offering, wouldn\\u2019t she?\\n\\nQuintax, praying to his jealous god, begged for the strength to see it through.\\n\\n\\u201cThy will be done,\\u201d he whispered. \\u201cThy will be done.\\u201d\\n\\nThere was once a philosopher, not from Earth, who speculated that the nature of evil is not so much that which opposes good, but a void in which good cannot exist. Only within such a space is there room for evil, which itself is a vacuum. That which is nothingness appears from nothingness, and can thus become anything it wants to be\\u2014imparting to evil a remarkable flexibility, because it can assume any form that it wants. Good suffers from pretensions; evil does not. Accordingly, it is easy for evil to slip on past, unnoticed by human eyes, in willful blindness.\\n\\nSo it was from nothingness that the creature appeared\\u2014the same one that would haunt Steven Quintax in the few dreams that he had left, like a nightmare fringe that leaves no trace of itself in the morning, save a tingling, barely palpable sense of fear; the same creature which, because of its nature, was the perfect warrior\\u2014a thing with no name and no face and no identity, only a singularity of purpose. Like a distillation of evil, it held no pretense. And like an incarnation of evil, it walked the vessel\\u2019s corridors at the border between reality and terror, where no eye could see nor any sensor detect.\\n\\nIt heard the voices and felt the heartbeats of those it passed, taking in a brief taste of life with every encounter, watching them with a curiosity that wasn\\u2019t so much alive as it was existent. It brushed by a few of them, some even close enough to touch, perhaps stirring a detached sort of dread easily dismissed as nerves or fatigue, before moving on to its objective. Because nothing would keep it from its objective.\\n\\nThe creature was Ponsak, and this was its duty.\\n\\nThe information systems architecture of a Galaxy-class starship consists of three computer cores, two of which are located on the port and starboard sides of the primary hull, while the third resides deep within the secondary. Each provides load balancing and redundancy for its counterparts, the split arrangement also allowing the two hulls to operate independently of one another during separated flight. Although largely automated, the cores are constantly monitored by specialists posted in an adjoining substation known as Subspace Field System Access\\u2014or SFSA\\u2014which is designated as a vaulted area because of its critical importance to shipboard operations. Aside from the captain and the XO, only those assigned to SFSA are permitted to enter.\\n\\nDuty there isn\\u2019t considered the worst on board, but it comes close. The gray walls, dark lighting, mazes of isolinear chips, and the sparse interfaces don\\u2019t present a warm and welcome sight (someone once observed that the designers had hired the same interior decorator as the Borg). Coupled with the constant, semi-sentient hum radiating from the core chamber, the atmosphere seems to actively loathe any living thing that enters it. This effect is, of course, entirely psychological, but it manifests itself consistently enough so that shifts are rotated out every four hours\\u2014the shortest duration of any on board. Because of this, the rest of the crew tends to view SFSA specialists as a little squirrel y, better at talking to machines than to other human beings. The specialists, for their part, think even less of outsiders in return\\u2014but they know how to keep things running, so they rarely get asked any questions.\\n\\nUnder non-combat conditions, the job of monitoring the cores is the responsibility of a two-person team. The lead position is held by a commissioned officer, typically a lieutenant junior-grade, assisted by a petty officer second-class. Their routine is a simple one, consisting primarily of fine tuning, maintenance and watching a diagnostic feed\\u2014monkey work, as the hardcore systems jockeys liked to call it, but demanded under regulations. The rest of the time, the team functions as a backstop against any possible contingency. That\\u2019s a fancy way of saying they sit around waiting for something to go wrong\\u2014and even then, they\\u2019re a superfluous component at best. If one of the cores goes down, the others kick in automatically to take up the slack; and beyond that, if the unthinkable happened, a system of dedicated subprocessors could take over minimal operations in the event of a multiple core failure. In essence, the emergency would have occurred, been isolated, and addressed before the crew could even hit the alert button.\\n\\nBut protocol was protocol, and if it was anything that Jean-Luc Picard impressed upon his people it was the human factor involved in all phases of ship\\u2019s operations. No matter how well the engineers had designed her, Enterprise was not perfect, and it was up to her crew to remain sharp when the vessel herself couldn\\u2019t. Sure, it was a platitude\\u2014but it was an effective one, and kept people from going going batshit when it seemed like duty consisted solely of staring at a screen of endless figures and waiting for the chimes to ring so you could go up to Ten Forward and be glad that it was someone else\\u2019s turn.\\n\\nSometimes, though, it wore thin. With the skipper acting beyond strange and a general pall of tension hanging over the ship, it was easy to glance up at the clock and think an hour had passed and find that it had only been five minutes. Specialist Divers had seen more than his share of that lately, with the in-betweens stretching out so long that he had started giving serious thought to another line of work. For most crewmen, that wouldn\\u2019t have been such a big deal; griping was practically a job requirement for the enlisted man, and Divers was no exception. But he was also a console cowboy through and through, having spent his entire life immersed in the obscure digital rhythms of every computer system he could get his hands on. Hell, the reason he had joined Starfleet in the first place was to get up close and personal with heavy tech. If that particular thrill was gone then there wasn\\u2019t a hell of a lot left for him, and more than one woman on board lived in fear of where his attentions might turn next.\\n\\nLieutenant Marksen wasn\\u2019t one of them, though. A stint in security meant she knew how to put the hurt on him, so Divers knew better than to mess with her. He barely even acknowledged Marksen as she climbed up a ladder from the lower decks and slid into the chair next to him, his eyes never leaving the bank of virtual screens that hovered over his station.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re early,\\u201d she said, firing up her own set of screens.\\n\\n\\u201cGot tired of the movie they were running in the mess club.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cCouldn\\u2019t tell. They all kind of look the same.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSailor\\u2019s lament,\\u201d she sighed, hitting a button to record for the log. \\u201cMarksen, Karen J. Assuming watch, 1200 hours. Divers, Bryan T. attending. Request identity confirmation.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI do so confirm,\\u201d Divers said.\\n\\n\\u201cThank God for that,\\u201d Marksen said, closing out the entry. \\u201cFor a second there, I thought I might have to shoot you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnything to break up the routine.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNumber three just completed a self-diagnostic,\\u201d Divers told her, his hands a blur as they moved across his console. \\u201cChip alpha-tango-seven-niner in array fourteen reports an impending fail and will need replacing. Oh, and there was a minor interference pattern that briefly triggered a breach mode before the core figured out what was going on and corrected itself.\\u201d\\n\\nMarksen called up the event on her console and studied the figures for a moment.\\n\\n\\u201cWere you able to pinpoint the exact source?\\u201d she asked.\\n\\n\\u201cClose enough to make it an easy call. It\\u2019s probably just a feedback surge coming off the pings from our own substation. Back at tech we used to call it a curly ghost. We\\u2019d see them pop off from time to time.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHmm,\\u201d Marksen mused. She didn\\u2019t really sound concerned\\u2014just bored and like she was looking for any kind of relief. \\u201cWhat was the duration of the breach?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAround 1.2257853 nanoseconds\\u2014or thereabouts.\\u201d He smiled a bit, amused at the mountain she was building out of this molehill. \\u201cIt really was no big deal, lieutenant. We flood the system with maintenance traffic all the time. Some of it just came back on us and got mistaken for an outside incursion, that\\u2019s all.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019d still feel better if one of us checked it out,\\u201d she said, hopping out of her chair. \\u201cI\\u2019ll take a tricorder with me just to make sure it isn\\u2019t something that could turn into a persistent leak. Could be we\\u2019ve got some bad shielding down there.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t worry about it too much,\\u201d Divers pointed out. \\u201cThe kind of surge we\\u2019re talking about doesn\\u2019t pack enough juice to cook popcorn.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen humor me,\\u201d Marksen ordered, heading for the hatch. It opened with a little hiss as the self-contained atmosphere depressurized with the rest of the cabin. \\u201cBesides, it\\u2019s not like we have anything better to do.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSince you\\u2019re going down there anyway, should I alert engineering so that you guys can replace that faulty chip?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMight as well,\\u201d Marksen agreed. \\u201cWhy should we have all the fun?\\u201d\\n\\nAnd with a friendly salute, the lieutenant was on her way. Divers shook his head, but consoled himself knowing that at least the exercise wasn\\u2019t a complete waste of time. He rang up engineering, expecting to hear some tool pusher on the other end. Instead he got Commander La Forge, who apparently had the nasty habit of answering his own calls. Divers gave him a rundown of the situation, which actually intrigued the chief engineer\\u2014although God only knew why. La Forge got so worked up he even volunteered to meet Marksen in SFSA himself. After all, it wasn\\u2019t every day he got to play detective with a curly ghost.\\n\\nClosing out, Divers sank bank into his chair and sighed.\\n\\nOfficers, he lamented. What can you do?\\n\\nBut he had no idea of the chain of events he had just set into motion.\\n\\nThe Ponsak swam in the liquid darkness that enveloped the computer core. In complete isolation, possessing a singularity of purpose, the creature might have felt completely alone in the universe\\u2014supposing that it had the capacity to feel anything. As it was, the Ponsak merely existed as a force without reason: action and reaction, driven by pure instinct, its directives hard-coded in its DNA. It never even occurred to the creature that its appearance might have created an infinitesimal distortion in the subspace field generated by the core, or that such a disturbance could have been detected. It merely proceeded, like a virus attacking its host, aware of nothing that didn\\u2019t immediately stand in its way.\\n\\nThe core itself was mammoth, rising a full two decks from base to apex. The Ponsak circled around the cylindrical face until it found a hard-link access panel, precisely where the starship\\u2019s schematics said it would be. Opening a compartment in its body armor, the Ponsak then retrieved the small device given to it by Captain Quintax. The creature had only a rudimentary understanding of how the Black Box worked, but had memorized every detail of its deployment. As the Ponsak affixed the device to the access panel, a tiny control pad appeared on its face. With a single touch, it engaged\\u2014and began the delicate process of inserting itself through the optical interface, the very gateway into the wider network.\\n\\nThe Ponsak, for its part, waited.\\n\\nA progress indicator ticked away the seconds, rising steadily until it completed the interface. The Ponsak then drilled down through the almost endless layers of information manipulated by the core, finally locating the controls for the ship\\u2019s orbital maneuvering system. Using a preprogrammed routine, it tied the box into those controls. All that remained was to lock everything down with a complex code series\\u2014\\n\\nThe Ponsak stopped, its movements frozen to absolute zero. Senses deviating from its immediate task, the creature expanded its sphere of awareness outward in circles until it detected the source of this new threat.\\n\\nIt waited to see if the human would go past, but calculated the odds as being unlikely. This area of the ship was restricted, and those who entered had a specific reason to be here. True to logic, the human stopped outside the access hatch and dialed in a key code. The hatch then popped open with a soft hiss\\u2014but the sound may as well have been a bullet, for all the potential violence it summoned.\\n\\nRetreating farther into the shadows, the Ponsak made like a hole in the dark.\\n\\nAnd prepared its butcher\\u2019s tools for work.\\n\\nMarksen watched the hatch slide open, light spilling into the core from behind her.\\n\\nHer own shadow fell across the floor, the shape of her body elongating to ghastly proportions as it mirrored her movements\\u2014a disconcerting effect that set her nerves on edge, though she couldn\\u2019t quite fathom why. Marksen had been here dozens of times and never paid it much mind, but all of a sudden she realized how isolated this place was. A person could scream and there wouldn\\u2019t be another soul to hear it\\u2014only the stark, imposing face of the core itself, which neither understood or cared. A person could die down here, and nobody would know it for hours or even days.\\n\\nMarksen chided herself for even thinking it, but still had to suppress a shudder before she could even walk inside. The atmosphere was frigid and dry, like nighttime in the desert, except for the utter sterility of the elements therein. They seemed to draw the life from her as she breathed them in, the core responding with quickening pulses of pseudolight that coursed through its stacks of isolinear chips. The sight of it filled Marksen with a vague dread of being watched, even beckoned, while her instincts pleaded with her to go the other way.\\n\\nGet a hold of yourself.\\n\\nOnly then did Marksen realize that she had been standing by the open doorway, no more than two steps in, steadying herself against the closest bulkhead. The droning of the ship filled her ears, giving her a handle on reality, and Marksen allowed it to clear her head. Reminding herself why she was here, she then reached for the tricorder she had picked up on her way down, peeling it off her belt and feeling the weight of it in her hands. It felt good and solid\\u2014a simple piece of tech, which answered with an affirmative tone as she flipped open the cover.\\n\\nJust get it done, she thought, and started scanning.\\n\\nThe tiny screen bathed her face in a pale green glow, the readings that appeared there strangely comforting. They didn\\u2019t show her much that she didn\\u2019t already know: the strong, proximal curve of a subspace field, modulations of energy states that propagated data along FTL routes\\u2014but all of it was neatly contained, with not a stray impulse to be found. Not a single sign of the \\u201ccurly ghost\\u201d Divers had described.\\n\\nThe voice jolted Marksen so hard she nearly dropped the tricorder. Clutching the device to her chest, she abruptly turned to see Commander La Forge approaching from the outside corridor. He ran to her side and took her by the arm, the concern on his face apparent even behind the VISOR that covered his eyes.\\n\\n\\u201cTake it easy there,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou okay?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d she blurted, still catching her breath. \\u201cSorry about that, commander. I must be a little jumpy today.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI have that affect on people.\\u201d\\n\\nMarksen laughed. Aside from Divers, Geordi La Forge was probably the least threatening man she knew\\u2014a fact only underscored by the warm smile he showed her. \\u201cTalk about weird,\\u201d she said, her fear dissipating to a tingle now that she was no longer alone. \\u201cYou ever walk into a room and just get the creeps?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou are ghost hunting,\\u201d La Forge told her, putting down a tool box that he had brought with him. \\u201cAnd let\\u2019s just say that I\\u2019ve seen a few corners of this ship that would make a great spot for a Halloween party.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cCount me in on the next one.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJust don\\u2019t tell the captain,\\u201d he joked. \\u201cSo did you find anything?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNot a whole a lot,\\u201d Marksen replied, handing him the tricorder. \\u201cShielding looks good, though we might be getting sporadic leaks off that faulty chip.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGood an explanation as any,\\u201d the chief engineer agreed, handing the device back. \\u201cStill, the tricorder can miss readings at the extreme ends of the subspace spectrum.\\u201d He tapped the side of his VISOR. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why I like to eyeball it.\\u201d\\n\\nMarksen smiled, and watched curiously as La Forge did his own scan of the area around the core. Methodically, he turned his gaze from one end to the other, moving in sweeps so that he could take it all in. \\u201cSo far so good,\\u201d he observed. \\u201cWhich array was giving you a problem?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s topside,\\u201d La Forge said, craning to get a look near the ceiling. \\u201cIf that is the source, then it should stand out pretty clear against the conventional EM\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nThe pause was unnatural. It filled the space between them with a mounting silence, building on an exponential curve. Marksen felt a stab of terror, sudden and irresistible\\u2014but not from within. This time it was real, and coming from the direction of La Forge\\u2019s stare.\\n\\nThe engineer frowned. \\u201cWhat the hell is that?\\u201d\\n\\nAnd with blinding speed, the terror fell upon them.\\n\\nLa Forge heard himself shout a warning out to Marksen, right before something savage clawed at him from out of the dark. The impact struck him squarely in the side of the head, reanimating his optic nerves with a bloom of stars and pain as it ripped his VISOR loose. He felt his forehead opening up like a seam, blood pouring into his useless eyes, his hands going up in front of his face in a useless attempt to protect himself. By, then, however, his attacker had moved on to other targets. Two quick jabs to his abdomen made him double over, gasping for breath, before another blow knocked his legs out from under him. La Forge crumpled, crashing into the deck so hard he could hear his bones rattle.\\n\\nThe most amazing force clamped down on the sides of his head. La Forge felt fingers digging into his skull, though it seemed impossible that anyone could be that strong. Fresh pain seeped into his brain like a hot flood, the rest of his body trivial by comparison. Unable to think, he reacted on instinct, tearing at the hands that held him\\u2014but then recoiled against them, so violently that he gagged. The touch was so monstrous, so reptilian, it branded him as unclean even as it squeezed the life out of him.\\n\\noh god oh dear god this thing\\u2019s not alive\\n\\nthis thing holding me touching me is not alive it\\u2019s dead\\n\\nA woman\\u2019s voice: \\u201cDivers! Emergency! We have an intruder\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nThe hands let go, dropping him to the floor.\\n\\nLa Forge heaved, spitting out blood as he rolled onto his side. Conscious thought pierced his mind like a hot lance, matching the agony that his body felt. Why hadn\\u2019t his attacker killed him? It would have been so easy, and La Forge would have welcomed it.\\n\\nThen he heard Marksen screaming, and the reason because crystal.\\n\\nHe groped for the device in a clumsy stupor, fingers dragging across the deck and tearing out his nails. La Forge paid it no heed. The only thing worse than facing the walking dead was facing it in blindness\\u2014and knowing that it had dispensed with him only to go after Marksen. The nightmare of having to sit and listen while that thing did to her what it did to him swelled up in his imagination like a tsunami rolling into shore, because in his mind\\u2019s eye he wouldn\\u2019t be blind at all. Because in his mind\\u2019s eye his imagination would see everything\\u2014\\n\\nThen a slow, gurgling sound. The snapping of wet twigs.\\n\\nLa Forge froze. The silence of the grave descended upon him.\\n\\n\\u201cLieutenant?\\u201d he called, reaching a hand out into the void.\\n\\nA blast of warm, viscous droplets sprayed La Forge in the face. He didn\\u2019t need to see it or taste it to know what it was. The sound of Marksen\\u2019s body, collapsing in a heap next to him, only confirmed that this blood was not his own.\\n\\nBut it would be soon enough. The walking dead would see to that.\\n\\nLa Forge opened up his soul and screamed.\\n\\nSecurity got the call from a frantic crewman. The ship\\u2019s computer routed it to the nearest standby team, where a master chief by the name of Costa answered. He listened closely, trying hard just to make out the crewman\\u2019s name\\u2014Danvers or something like that\\u2014but the voice on the other end was terrified beyond comprehension, babbling so fast that the chief barely understood. He only managed to pick out bits and pieces, fragmented by the sound of a battering ram against a steel door\\u2014until a loud screech burst in, and the voice shouted for the last time.\\n\\nThen the channel cut out. Static and then silence.\\n\\nCosta jumped onto a nearby console, tracing the call to its point of origin. His display highlighted a small area on Deck 31, identifying the section: Subspace Field Systems Access. He tried to raise the crewman again, but nobody answered. That was all Costa needed to know.\\n\\nAlerting the squad on duty, he went over to the armory and punched an access code into the electronic lock. The door slid open as his people arrived, all ten of them filing in one at a time and outfitting themselves with the required equipment: Type II handheld phasers for everyone, with a Type I for use as a backup. Costa did the same, strapping the weapons to his belt and heading out after them\\u2014but then stopped when something else caught his eye.\\n\\nThere, bolted to the wall, was a heavy phaser rifle. The chief thought about it for a moment, remembering the sheer terror he heard in that voice.\\n\\n\\u201cScrew it,\\u201d he said, and grabbed the rifle.\\n\\nAs Costa walked back into the security station, the others noticed the firepower he had slung over his shoulder. They all exchanged the same look, and knew it was bad.\\n\\n\\u201cTime to earn that paycheck,\\u201d the chief said, and led them out to fight.\\n\\nThe Ponsak ran like the devil, no longer concerned with remaining invisible. Anyone it encountered now would be killed\\u2014the equation was as simple as that. Its first priority had been to neutralize the crewman in SFSA. The woman in the core had managed to warn him before the Ponsak disposed of her, creating the very real danger that the core would be taken offline before the Black Box could be fully activated. With SFSA secured, that was no longer a possibility. But there was still the matter of the Box itself, which was not yet ready. With security on the way, the Ponsak had only minutes to complete its mission. After that, it had only to defend its position\\u2014which it would do to the death.\\n\\nIt slipped back into the confines of the core, bypassing the human who still lived. The Ponsak had quickly decided that the human was a minimal threat at this point, and that even the scant few seconds required to finish him off was too much of a delay. Instead, it bounded up the side of the wall like a gigantic insect, once more up toward the ceiling where the Black Box waited. Only a few more keystrokes and its very existence would be complete.\\n\\nAnd it would have all the time in the world to kill.\\n\\nLieutenant Worf routed an Enterprise schematic to the bridge\\u2019s main viewscreen, which showed the engineering core flashing in red. Immediately around it, section dividers also flashed yellow, showing the areas being secured by approaching forces. The Klingon had wasted no time assigning full complements\\u2014not after hearing the distress call. Captain Picard, for his part, hadn\\u2019t argued with him.\\n\\n\\u201cAll security teams reporting in,\\u201d Worf said, reading off his panel. \\u201cDecks 30 through 37 have been evacuated to within five sections of the computer core.\\u201d\\n\\nPicard walked up the ramp that led to the rear of the bridge, joining Worf at the tactical station. The captain watched as moving green dots, which represented each member of the teams, approached the core from both fore and aft on all seven decks. They formed a perimeter around the evacuated sections and then stopped.\\n\\n\\u201cYes. Specialist David Divers, the one who made the call to security\\u2014and Lieutenant Sharon Marksen, who was also on the core duty roster.\\u201d Worf paused for a long moment, and then finally added, \\u201cEngineering reports that Lieutenant Commander La Forge went there ten minutes ago. He is not responding to calls.\\u201d\\n\\nMy God, Picard thought, but kept it to himself. He ran over the scenarios, none of them good. Sensors were useless around the core because the shielding there was too thick, so there was no way to tell if any of them were alive; and even if they were, beaming them out of there was out of the question for the very same reason. Picard shuddered at the thought of what he had to do next\\u2014but as captain, he knew there was no other way to protect the safety of his ship.\\n\\nAt least until we know what the hell is going on.\\n\\n\\u201cEngage the emergency doors,\\u201d he ordered. \\u201cSeal off all sections within the evacuation perimeter. Nobody but the security teams goes in or out.\\u201d\\n\\nCosta read the words stenciled into the bulkhead, the stark, bold lettering that he had seen a hundred times before now conveying the malevolence of the unknown. He signaled for his people to stop, then leveled the sights of his phaser rifle down the short distance that remained between him and SFSA. Tight sweeps on the infra-red detected nothing but empty space, the motion sensor keyed to his spyglass totally still. Even so, the sensor on the back of Costa\\u2019s neck tingled\\u2014and he trusted that a hell of a lot more than any electronic gear. Something was out there, taunting him and daring him to enter.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s right. I can see you but you can\\u2019t see me.\\n\\nHe took a step forward, clinging as close as he could to the wall. Out in front of him, the corridor bent to the left, cutting off his line of sight just short of the hatch that marked his objective.\\n\\nI could be anywhere. Maybe right next to you.\\n\\n\\u201cDammit,\\u201d Costa swore under his breath. He repositioned himself, rifle trained on the kill zone in front of him, but there was no way of seeing without sticking his head out. After that, it was all or nothing.\\n\\nIf you make it that far. If I don\\u2019t take your head off first\\u2026\\n\\nThe chief blinked the sweat from his eyes. Behind him, spaced about two meters apart, the other members of his team took cover behind the archways that led back toward the turbolift. All of them stood at the ready, their bodies like tight coils poised to strike, phasers leveled to give maximum protection to the man walking point. Costa trusted them with his life, and knew they would take down any threat before it could get close to him\\u2014but still, this felt like something else. This felt like something different.\\n\\nThe team stood by, waiting for Costa to make a decision.\\n\\nSteeling his will, the chief thrust himself out in the open. He already had a heavy pull on his rifle\\u2019s trigger, imagining the hell of phaser fire he would unleash on the first thing that twitched\\u2014but when nothing materialized, he gave the rest of the team the signal to go in. Moving in two-by-two formations, they quickly followed Costa\\u2019s lead and closed the last few meters to SFSA. There, they formed a tight cordon, weapons leveled at the entrance.\\n\\nCosta didn\\u2019t even need to look back at his team to know they were ready.\\n\\nOne step at a time, he inched over to the hatch\\u2014or what was left of it. Once a heavy, pressurized door, it had been dented inwards by some incredible force. Costa couldn\\u2019t spot any blast marks, which meant someone had gone in the hard way. He tried not to think about what could cause that kind of damage, though even his rifle now seemed like a piss poor defense against whatever it was. More than that, it would be a goddamn miracle if they could keep this thing contained.\\n\\nHolding his breath, Costa reached out and gave the door a push.\\n\\nIt swung in, giving some resistance on the other side. He tried again, harder this time, but it still wouldn\\u2019t give way. Motioning to the others, Costa positioned two of them on both sides of the entryway. Then, stepping back with his weapon at the ready, he had one of them give the door a pull. It opened slowly with a long, mournful groan\\u2014a sound like the rusted hinges of a mausoleum, with the smell of death closely behind it.\\n\\nAnd a body spilled out into the corridor.\\n\\nCosta jumped back, as the corpse\\u2019s arm flopped down near his boots. It was the only part that still looked remotely human. The rest looked like it had gone through a shredder, the remains of its uniform sliced to ribbons along with the flesh beneath. What remained of the face was even less recognizable, having been pried off and leaving behind a mostly empty skull\\u2014as if some savage hand had simply reached in and scooped it out. Worse that that, however, was the utter lack of blood. All of the wounds had been neatly cauterized, adding an insane sterility to the unspeakable violence.\\n\\nStepping over the body, the chief jammed the business end of his rifle into the confined space beyond the door. In less than two seconds, he confirmed that SFSA was secure. Whatever had carved up the poor bastard had moved on. He then went back and plucked the comm badge off the dead man\\u2019s chest, reading the name embossed on the device.\\n\\n\\u201cDivers,\\u201d Costa said. \\u201cMust be the guy who phoned it in.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGot us a bad one,\\u201d someone else added. \\u201cWhat is this thing, chief?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m more worried about where it is.\\u201d Costa tried sensors again, picking up signatures on every member of his team, but beyond that only noise. Giving up on that line, he tuned his own senses to the air: electricity infused with fear, the kind of thing that made his hairs stand on end. It was still around\\u2014of that he was certain.\\n\\nCosta also knew he had to draw it out.\\n\\nUnless I draw you out first.\\n\\nAnd then, from a short distance away, something else.\\n\\nEveryone tensed. Everyone heard it\\u2014but the words had been so weak, so ephemeral, that belief came hard. Only dead silence could coax that sound back from the deep, and when they heard it again there was no room for doubt.\\n\\nCosta shot a glance down the corridor, in the direction of that plea. There was only one possible place from which it could have come.\\n\\n\\u201cThe core,\\u201d he told the others, and ran toward it.\\n\\nAlert lights flashed above the entrance to the computer core, conspiring with the darkness inside to create a hellish red glow. Costa detected the smell of charred flesh as the team approached, a smoky haze still hanging heavy over the entirety of the section. Costa went in first, crouching in a defensive position while the others poured in behind him. And there, as his eyes adjusted to the gloom, he took in the full scale of what had happened.\\n\\nThe core was a veritable chamber of horrors.\\n\\nUnlike the comparatively clean kill back in SFSA, this place had been rendered in an orgy of blood. Spatter was everywhere, forming helter-skelter patterns on the walls and chip arrays, more blood than seemed possible in a dozen human bodies. Costa swallowed his own gag reflex, trying to stay sharp as he swept the much larger space for signs of movement. He stopped suddenly on one area of the bulkhead, thinking he saw the outline of a person\\u2014until he realized with sickening clarity that the shape had been blasted there in an outline of gore and loose tissue. Beneath that, he found the source: two more corpses, laying in a viscous, spreading pool that appeared more black than red.\\n\\nExcept that one of them stirred.\\n\\nThe chief moved in. He checked the body that didn\\u2019t move\\u2014a woman laying face down on the deck\\u2014and quickly determined that she was dead. He then went to the other one\\u2014a man with an engineering insignia, the pins on his collar indicating a rank of lieutenant commander. Only when Costa turned him over did he see the milky white of the man\\u2019s eyes, his features bruised but unmistakable.\\n\\n\\u201cCommander La Forge,\\u201d Costa told him. \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay. We\\u2019ve got you.\\u201d\\n\\nLa Forge\\u2019s useless eyes fluttered, his head lolling back and forth.\\n\\n\\u201cNo, no, no,\\u201d the chief engineer babbled, half delirious. \\u201cNo, it can\\u2019t be. This can\\u2019t be happening. Lieutenant Marksen\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re here to help,\\u201d Costa said, trying to calm him down. \\u201cBut we need to get you out of here first.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd Costa had to know.\\n\\nLa Forge slumped back, and spoke in a voice that was not his own.\\n\\nThe chief felt La Forge\\u2019s shock drain into him. From there it filled the entire core, like tentacles wrapping around each member of his team, the living only one heartbeat removed from the dead. Somehow, one of them found the commander\\u2019s VISOR and handed it to Costa. Turning the thing over in his hands, Costa could only imagine the horrors it had drilled into La Forge\\u2019s brain before coming off.\\n\\nBut La Forge wanted it back. He reached for it, knowing it was there.\\n\\nCosta gave the VISOR to him. La Forge snapped it into place, and a moment rose to his own two feet. He refused help, instead steadying himself against the bulkhead until he regained some of his strength. No longer blind, no longer tentative, he then straightened himself out and took in everything around him.\\n\\nThe security team, watching him in trepidation.\\n\\nThe woman\\u2019s body, still in death but by no means peaceful.\\n\\nAnd finally himself, his uniform soaked in blood.\\n\\nBut none of that could compare. Not to the realization of horror that dawned across La Forge\\u2019s face, manifesting itself in a slow, deliberate turn toward the doorway. Costa followed that gaze, as did the others, to find them all trapped\\u2014blocked by a figure more shadow than substance, but unquestionably real in its intentions. It appeared humanoid, but Costa knew better. This was the devil of which La Forge spoke, revealing itself in full.\\n\\nAnd pulled the trigger while he still could.\", \"author\": \"Marc Giller\", \"url\": \"https://noqreport.com/2020/01/27/star-trek-shadow-prime-book-i-chapter-11/\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 15:00:42 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580155242, \"collection_utc\": 1580172402}",News,1580155242

If you\\u2019ve ever wondered what Star Trek would be like as a modern, Tom Clancy-esque techno-thriller, you\\u2019ve come to the right place. Just in case you\\u2019ve missed the previous installments, you can find them here:\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, if you like this book and want to see it in print, ping Simon & Schuster and Pocket Books on social media and let them know!\\n\\nThe small patch of real estate carved out of the south side of the metroplex had been set aside by the Bezzeret as the Federation\\u2019s operational zone (called OZ on the official maps), but to the small community of scientists and support personnel who lived there it was known as Skid Row\\u2014a modest collection of modular buildings, each one indistinguishable from the others, deposited there by the Starfleet Corps of Engineers when they cobbled the facilities together eight years ago. In that time they had not aged well, taking on the characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood\\u2014a rather seedy part of town as those things went in this day and age, populated by the lower-caste types that always seemed to exist at the fringes of an industrial society, doing the menial jobs that the upper caste would just as soon forget. Flanked by distribution hubs and warehouses, the place didn\\u2019t have much going for it\\u2014just a few shops that sold cheap knock-off goods to offworlders and a dive bar that passed itself off as an exotic cabaret; but the Bezzeret allowed the Federation to conduct itself there more or less autonomously, and the locals\\u2014grateful for the influx of business\\u2014rarely made trouble for their guests.\\n\\nWill Riker sensed it even before he materialized inside the zone, like a heat wave of raw emotion spilling over the border that marked the edge of friendly territory. So did Bev Crusher, who tensed the moment she came out of the matter stream, both of them taking in their surroundings to pinpoint the source. It wasn\\u2019t hard to find. An angry native crowd, milling about outside the compound, bristled at the sight of them\\u2014two more invaders to complement the dozens of others who had beamed down ahead of them as part of the advance team.\\n\\n\\u201cWarm welcome,\\u201d Bev Crusher remarked, having dropped in next to him. \\u201cThink they\\u2019ll ask us to stay for dinner?\\u201d\\n\\nRiker looked the crowd over, searching for signs of real danger. The gathering was hardly what he would have called a riot, but he could see the hate in their eyes nonetheless.\\n\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t plan on being here that long,\\u201d he replied. \\u201cCome on.\\u201d\\n\\nThe two of them made their way through a flurry of activity, toward the center of the compound where most of the action was taking place. Uniformed crewmen from Enterprise pitched in with the resident civilian researchers, taking down what was left of the complex. They loaded everything they could into the large transport containers that Riker had sent down, battering most of the equipment in their haste\\u2014not that the commander took issue. His orders on the matter had been very clear: Get in, get out, do it fast. All other considerations secondary. The only exception were the Level 5 biologicals, which Beverly was here to handle. Bad as things were, an accident involving some nasty pathogen would only make things worse\\u2014and the captain had been quite specific about not making things worse.\\n\\nHe and Beverly turned in the direction of a harried but booming voice, belonging to what could have been the fattest man Riker had ever seen. He bounded toward them faster than what should have been possible, so epic in girth that it seemed he couldn\\u2019t be human; but as he finally arrived, the man revealed himself to be just that\\u2014genteel and with a good humor that made Riker take an instant liking to him.\\n\\n\\u201cWelcome to Skid Row,\\u201d the man huffed, his face beet red but managing to squeeze out a smile between rivulets of sweat. \\u201cOr at least what\\u2019s left of it. Your people came ready to party, I\\u2019ll hand you that.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe aim to please,\\u201d Riker said, shaking his hand. \\u201cAre you Dr. Morton?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cResident xenosociologist,\\u201d Morton replied, \\u201cwhich is a fancy way of saying I don\\u2019t work for a living. Please call me Alex.\\u201d He then turned to Beverly. \\u201cNow I know what you\\u2019re thinking, Dr. Crusher\\u2014so before you whip out that tricorder, I\\u2019ll have you know that I\\u2019ve actually lost over twenty kilos since getting marooned on this rock. Check my file if you don\\u2019t believe me.\\u201d\\n\\nBeverly laughed. \\u201cThe food here must be terrible.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOne of the many things I won\\u2019t miss,\\u201d he affirmed, motioning toward their growing audience outside the compound. \\u201cYou get a chance to meet the neighbors? They\\u2019ve been a bit frisky as of late.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey\\u2019re mostly good people,\\u201d Morton continued, \\u201cbut with a few professional agitators thrown in the mix. The government likes to keep things stirred up, if you know what I mean. Makes it easier to blame outsiders for all their problems.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSo we\\u2019ve seen,\\u201d Beverly said, zipping up her jacket to ward off the early morning desert chill\\u2014but not before Morton noticed the Type II phaser holstered underneath. He didn\\u2019t appear surprised, just mildly amused.\\n\\n\\u201cSure your last name ain\\u2019t Holliday?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYou ought to see the rest of her kit,\\u201d Riker said drily. \\u201cAre any of your people armed?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAgainst the law,\\u201d Morton replied, \\u201ceven for citizens. The government also likes to keep everyone on a short leash.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cStill, it might be a good idea,\\u201d Riker decided. \\u201cI\\u2019d feel a lot better knowing we had an edge, especially if things get out of hand.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe local constabulary might take issue with that.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cFrag \\u2018em. The Bezzeret don\\u2019t get to make all the rules.\\u201d\\n\\nMorton grinned. \\u201cGlad to have you on our side, commander.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cLikewise\\u2014\\u201d Riker began, but got cut off by a piercing shriek that stabbed across the grounds. He reacted instantly, turning in the direction of the sound\\u2014knowing on an instinctive level that it wasn\\u2019t human, but recognizing the rage contained within just the same. Beverly did the same, hand dropping to her weapon as she looked back toward the entrance of the compound, where they saw a throng of Bezzeret protestors now pouring through. Riker had no idea what set them off, but at least as many Federation personnel surged in to meet them. With the two waves fast converging, God only knew what would happen when they hit.\\n\\n\\u201cDammit,\\u201d Riker seethed, heading straight into the fracas with Beverly on his six. Morton did his best to keep up, but quickly fell behind in the swell of bodies as the two officers pushed their way through. \\u201cMake a hole!\\u201d Riker shouted, barely able to hear himself over the crowd, which only grew louder and more rambunctious the deeper he went. By now, everyone was itching for a fight\\u2014himself included, even though he didn\\u2019t quite know why.\\n\\nThen he reached the center of the storm, and saw for himself.\\n\\nThere, in the no man\\u2019s land between the two opposing factions, one of Morton\\u2019s people \\u2014a woman, no less\\u2014faced off against a Bezzeret. The two circled each other, already dusted up and bloodied from more than a few traded blows. Morton\\u2019s girl held her own, though, getting some jabs in as her much taller opponent swung at her.\\n\\n\\u201cCome on, you stringy bastard,\\u201d she taunted. \\u201cThat the best you got?\\u201d\\n\\nThe Bezzeret bared his teeth, emitting a low growl\\u2014the same bestial tone Riker had heard before. The sound of it made his blood run cold, almost as much as the dull glow behind the Bezzeret\\u2019s eyes.\\n\\nAnd Riker knew: He\\u2019ll kill her if he gets the chance.\\n\\nThe woman, agile as she was, didn\\u2019t fully realize the danger. Dropping her guard only for a second, she gave the Bezzeret the opening he needed. He lunged, moving unbelievably fast, fingers hooked into claws and reaching for her neck. Somehow the woman saw it coming, and pivoted her body to the left to avoid what would have been a fatal strike. But her shoulder took the brunt instead, the impact spinning her around and stuffing her face-first into the ground. She pushed herself up, scrambling to get clear, but the Bezzeret grabbed her by the sides of the head\\u2014his powerful hands squeezing her skull, determined to crush it.\\n\\nBoth men went flying, a tangle of limbs thrashing against one another. Riker held the advantage, though, rolling away and jumping up before the dazed Bezzeret knew what was happening. He then crouched, ready to go on offense again as the Bezzeret clambered back to his feet. This time the alien hissed, an altogether demonic sound, and Riker saw the hell fire behind those eyes directed at him. Clearly, this wasn\\u2019t going to end until one of them was dead\\u2014and the crowd, now worked to an absolute frenzy, expected nothing less.\\n\\nUntil the scream of a phaser silenced them.\\n\\nThe beam struck the Bezzeret squarely in the chest, so hard that it knocked him back several meters. He crumpled to the ground a twitching mass, his body racked by stray electrical impulses, though his moans left no doubt that he was still alive. The phaser had only been set to stun\\u2014but jacked to a high enough level to hurt. Riker had to admire the shooter\\u2019s style.\\n\\nThe crowd parting, he saw Beverly level her weapon at the other protesters.\\n\\nSomething in her tone made the Bezzeret take heed. They retreated a few steps, helping their comrade up, but then regained enough courage to stand their ground. That was when Morton arrived, even more winded than before, and sized up the situation in that canny way of his. Kneeling down to assist the woman from his team, he looked up at Beverly and then towards Riker.\\n\\n\\u201cIs this what you meant by out of hand?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\nThe Bezzeret also waited on Riker\\u2019s answer. He could tell that they were on the edge, and that the slightest push could nudge them either way. He thought about drawing his own phaser, matching Beverly\\u2019s show of force, but instinct made him reconsider. This was a brawl, not a battle\\u2014and he had already seized the initiative with his fists.\\n\\n\\u201cI will have order!\\u201d he shouted, in a voice that would have made his drill instructor at the Academy proud. \\u201cYou people will disperse immediately so we can finish our work. Anybody who interferes,\\u201d he trailed off, leveling an acid scowl at the stunned Bezzeret. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve already seen what happens.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Bezzeret chattered amongst themselves, still uncertain.\\n\\n\\u201cMake it hard on us,\\u201d Riker prodded, \\u201cwe\\u2019ll make it even harder on you.\\u201d\\n\\nThey exchanged a few glances, searching for a leader. None arose.\\n\\n\\u201cSo what\\u2019s it going to be?\\u201d\\n\\nThe heat that fed the Bezzeret frenzy settled into a slow burn. Gradually, they began to disperse\\u2014including the one Beverly shot, who hobbled away with the aid of his friends, his pride wounded more than anything else. He spat at Riker\\u2019s feet as he went past, muttering something in his native language that cast a ripple of assent among the others.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\\u201d Riker asked.\\n\\n\\u201cHumans go home,\\u201d Morton translated, dusting off his knees as he and Beverly came over. They watched the Bezzeret retreat, which extended back to the compound\\u2019s perimeter, but went no farther. There they remained, like a storm hanging just off shore, replenishing their fury for next time. \\u201cIf it\\u2019s all the same to you, I\\u2019d like like to grant their wish. The best view of this place will be in the rear view mirror\\u2014preferably with a beer in hand.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI heard that,\\u201d Riker agreed, and started to walk with Beverly and Morton toward the operations shack. Enterprise had already started beaming cargo up, the large carriers dematerializing in the courtyard as they went by. \\u201cWe got the manifest for all your gear, but I\\u2019m thinking we ought to prioritize. As long as we get the vital stuff first, we can leave the rest of it behind if things deteriorate any more than they already have.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey can bill me,\\u201d the commander retorted, turning to Beverly. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s our time frame for securing the biologicals?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThree hours,\\u201d she answered. \\u201cTwo if we really push it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTwo hours,\\u201d Riker grumbled. \\u201cNot even enough time for a poker game.\\u201d It was, however, a lot more time than he wanted to spend here, with all those Bezzeret eyes watching. And the protestors outside the grounds were only the beginning. There might well be even more of them, staring down from the ramshackle buildings of Skid Row, waiting for some signal to attack. Plenty of places to hide in there, Riker thought, feeling more vulnerable than ever before. If it came down to actually defending this place, he had no idea how the hell to do it.\\n\\n\\u201cMove like you got a purpose,\\u201d he ordered.\\n\\nThe volume of computer activity that takes place on board starship is considerable. In fact, the burden placed on its computer cores are of such magnitude and importance that the use of conventional processing elements is impossible\\u2014they are simply too slow. To answer these demands, a network which makes use of optical transtator clusters made up of thousands of faster than light nanoprocessor units was developed to become the \\u201cnervous system\\u201d of a starship. In essence, the same theory which made warp drive a working reality was applied to generating a subspace field within this network, thus allowing the ship\\u2019s computer to process information at faster than light speeds. Not only did this arrangement free the designers from the confines of real space processing, it also saved a lot of headaches by eliminating the need to support the almost absolute-zero temperatures required by conventional superconductors.\\n\\nThe principle was efficient, stable and had been in use for nearly 200 years. From an engineering standpoint, there was virtually no downside\\u2014except for one possibility that nearly everyone had overlooked.\\n\\nWhen the subject of catastrophic failure came up at the original project meetings, only one scientist\\u2014a multidimensional physicist named David Zeen\\u2014pointed out that there indeed was an Achilles Heel hidden within the system. A theoretician with an obsessive-compulsive streak, Zeen worried about everything\\u2014including the possibility that a subspace pulse of a certain magnitude could wreak havoc with the isolinear processors that were central to the core\\u2019s design. If the pulse were especially strong, it could effectively wipe them clean, like an eraser being dragged across a chalkboard.\\n\\nBy this time, of course, a great deal of time and money had already been spent on the original design. Implementing safeguards against the kind of event Zeen postulated would have set the project back by several months, if not a year or more. Further undermining his argument was the simple fact that freak subspace pulses were almost unheard of in nature, outside of a supernova or the event horizon of a black hole\\u2014and if a starship ever got close enough to one of those, a computer failure would be the least of its problems. Accordingly, in true bureaucratic fashion, Zeen\\u2019s opinion was carefully noted and summarily discarded. Work proceeded on schedule and everyone went their separate ways.\\n\\nExcept that somewhere along the line, word trickled back to Starfleet Tactical. The rocket boys there had already been working on ways to screw with an enemy vessel\\u2019s warp drive by subjecting it to intense subspace fields, an effort that had yielded mixed results at best. The revelation that they could apply the same techniques more effectively to screwing with an enemy vessel\\u2019s computer\\u2014well, that seemed like the next best thing. And seeing as the department had already budgeted for the research, they didn\\u2019t need to go to the Federation for additional funding. Not only was this cost-conscious, it also allowed the admiral in charge to keep any new weapons that resulted off the books.\\n\\nSo began the development of what would become the Localized Conductive Subspace Interference Generator\\u2014LoConSIG for short, a rather clunky acronym that no one would ever use. In more vicious circles (and there were many), it was known as the Starship Killer. Euphemistically, it was called the Black Box\\u2014an overtly descriptive name, but like Pandora\\u2019s Box, one that gave no clue as to the deadly contents inside.\\n\\nIt is not a bomb, though it could be categorized as a weapon of mass destruction. A small, rectangular object, it measures 50cm by 30cm with no visible controls aside from a small programming pad on the topmost surface. The components are divided into two sub-systems: one is capable of rerouting computer systems and executing commands, while the other is a tiny but lethal static subspace field generator capable of delivering a whopping burst of 4500 millocochranes. In real time, the length of this burst is less than one-thousandth of a second\\u2014but it is enough to inflict fatal damage on a faster-than-light computer system.\\n\\nWhat David Zeen had envisioned as his worst nightmare, Tactical had made a working reality. Frightening as it was, though, the Black Box ultimately didn\\u2019t find much of a place for itself among the arsenal of more conventional weapons. Commonplace as they were, phasers and photon torpedoes could be used at a distance\\u2014you simply aimed at fired. Using the Black Box was a bit more complex, because it worked from the inside out. It had to be tied directly to a ship\\u2019s core interface, which meant someone had to beam aboard an enemy vessel to deploy it\\u2014and that, as they say, is easier said than done under combat conditions.\\n\\nWhat the Black Box could do effectively, however, was destroy a ship without leaving a trace of itself. With all of its other limitations, that left the weapon but with one real use: sabotage. Given the state of affairs in the Federation, though, and the Council\\u2019s general reluctance to authorize covert actions, that meant in all likelihood that the Black Box would spend its life gathering dust in some vault\\u2014an interesting proof of concept, but little more.\\n\\nStill, there were those who thought it wasn\\u2019t a bad thing to have around. Terrence Blake was such a man. From the moment he first saw the Black Box, he understood its potential. In fact, he had been so impressed with the device that he arranged to have several of them deployed in the field, each one in the hands of a trusted ally. It was a proactive move on his part\\u2014highly illegal, given the lack of Starfleet sanction, but a wise one nonetheless. Blake hadn\\u2019t risen up the chain of command by being caught unprepared, and the Black Box gave him an edge that nobody else had.\\n\\nBecause you never knew when you would have to destroy a ship in secret.\\n\\nEspecially one of your own.\\n\\nSteven Quintax felt strange, staring down into his empty hands. Only moments before, he had held the Black Box in them, pondering the sheer power and naked potential contained in such an innocuous package. Stranger still, he had handed it off without any hesitation at all\\u2014a transaction, more or less, like contraband between pirates, conducted in the secrecy of his quarters. Only now, left alone with his thoughts, did he begin to realize the magnitude of what he had set into motion.\\n\\nThe admiral would have done the same thing, Quintax kept telling himself. He always made the tough decisions. When he gets wind of this, he\\u2019ll know I did the right thing.\\n\\nSo why did his hands shake so badly?\\n\\nHe balled them into fists, trying to quell his angst, rocking back and forth but finding no peace in repetition. His conscience would simply not allow it\\u2014a conscience that had been notably absent in the presence of the Ponsak, who had taken the box from him and disappeared. Quintax knew where the creature was by now, though he could never fathom how; it was one of those things he chose not to question, for fear of where the answer might lead. He only knew that what he had started could not be stopped.\\n\\nAnd he would most certainly be damned for it.\\n\\nQuintax rocked some more, that thought actually giving him some measure of comfort. Perhaps hell wouldn\\u2019t be such a bad place after all\\u2014and there was a certain solace in knowing that it was his final destination. Still, Quintax couldn\\u2019t shake the image of Blake looking down at him, in pitiful disappointment: Zeus, with his all to familiar contempt for the weakness of mere mortals. Enterprise would make a fine enough burnt offering, wouldn\\u2019t she?\\n\\nQuintax, praying to his jealous god, begged for the strength to see it through.\\n\\n\\u201cThy will be done,\\u201d he whispered. \\u201cThy will be done.\\u201d\\n\\nThere was once a philosopher, not from Earth, who speculated that the nature of evil is not so much that which opposes good, but a void in which good cannot exist. Only within such a space is there room for evil, which itself is a vacuum. That which is nothingness appears from nothingness, and can thus become anything it wants to be\\u2014imparting to evil a remarkable flexibility, because it can assume any form that it wants. Good suffers from pretensions; evil does not. Accordingly, it is easy for evil to slip on past, unnoticed by human eyes, in willful blindness.\\n\\nSo it was from nothingness that the creature appeared\\u2014the same one that would haunt Steven Quintax in the few dreams that he had left, like a nightmare fringe that leaves no trace of itself in the morning, save a tingling, barely palpable sense of fear; the same creature which, because of its nature, was the perfect warrior\\u2014a thing with no name and no face and no identity, only a singularity of purpose. Like a distillation of evil, it held no pretense. And like an incarnation of evil, it walked the vessel\\u2019s corridors at the border between reality and terror, where no eye could see nor any sensor detect.\\n\\nIt heard the voices and felt the heartbeats of those it passed, taking in a brief taste of life with every encounter, watching them with a curiosity that wasn\\u2019t so much alive as it was existent. It brushed by a few of them, some even close enough to touch, perhaps stirring a detached sort of dread easily dismissed as nerves or fatigue, before moving on to its objective. Because nothing would keep it from its objective.\\n\\nThe creature was Ponsak, and this was its duty.\\n\\nThe information systems architecture of a Galaxy-class starship consists of three computer cores, two of which are located on the port and starboard sides of the primary hull, while the third resides deep within the secondary. Each provides load balancing and redundancy for its counterparts, the split arrangement also allowing the two hulls to operate independently of one another during separated flight. Although largely automated, the cores are constantly monitored by specialists posted in an adjoining substation known as Subspace Field System Access\\u2014or SFSA\\u2014which is designated as a vaulted area because of its critical importance to shipboard operations. Aside from the captain and the XO, only those assigned to SFSA are permitted to enter.\\n\\nDuty there isn\\u2019t considered the worst on board, but it comes close. The gray walls, dark lighting, mazes of isolinear chips, and the sparse interfaces don\\u2019t present a warm and welcome sight (someone once observed that the designers had hired the same interior decorator as the Borg). Coupled with the constant, semi-sentient hum radiating from the core chamber, the atmosphere seems to actively loathe any living thing that enters it. This effect is, of course, entirely psychological, but it manifests itself consistently enough so that shifts are rotated out every four hours\\u2014the shortest duration of any on board. Because of this, the rest of the crew tends to view SFSA specialists as a little squirrel y, better at talking to machines than to other human beings. The specialists, for their part, think even less of outsiders in return\\u2014but they know how to keep things running, so they rarely get asked any questions.\\n\\nUnder non-combat conditions, the job of monitoring the cores is the responsibility of a two-person team. The lead position is held by a commissioned officer, typically a lieutenant junior-grade, assisted by a petty officer second-class. Their routine is a simple one, consisting primarily of fine tuning, maintenance and watching a diagnostic feed\\u2014monkey work, as the hardcore systems jockeys liked to call it, but demanded under regulations. The rest of the time, the team functions as a backstop against any possible contingency. That\\u2019s a fancy way of saying they sit around waiting for something to go wrong\\u2014and even then, they\\u2019re a superfluous component at best. If one of the cores goes down, the others kick in automatically to take up the slack; and beyond that, if the unthinkable happened, a system of dedicated subprocessors could take over minimal operations in the event of a multiple core failure. In essence, the emergency would have occurred, been isolated, and addressed before the crew could even hit the alert button.\\n\\nBut protocol was protocol, and if it was anything that Jean-Luc Picard impressed upon his people it was the human factor involved in all phases of ship\\u2019s operations. No matter how well the engineers had designed her, Enterprise was not perfect, and it was up to her crew to remain sharp when the vessel herself couldn\\u2019t. Sure, it was a platitude\\u2014but it was an effective one, and kept people from going going batshit when it seemed like duty consisted solely of staring at a screen of endless figures and waiting for the chimes to ring so you could go up to Ten Forward and be glad that it was someone else\\u2019s turn.\\n\\nSometimes, though, it wore thin. With the skipper acting beyond strange and a general pall of tension hanging over the ship, it was easy to glance up at the clock and think an hour had passed and find that it had only been five minutes. Specialist Divers had seen more than his share of that lately, with the in-betweens stretching out so long that he had started giving serious thought to another line of work. For most crewmen, that wouldn\\u2019t have been such a big deal; griping was practically a job requirement for the enlisted man, and Divers was no exception. But he was also a console cowboy through and through, having spent his entire life immersed in the obscure digital rhythms of every computer system he could get his hands on. Hell, the reason he had joined Starfleet in the first place was to get up close and personal with heavy tech. If that particular thrill was gone then there wasn\\u2019t a hell of a lot left for him, and more than one woman on board lived in fear of where his attentions might turn next.\\n\\nLieutenant Marksen wasn\\u2019t one of them, though. A stint in security meant she knew how to put the hurt on him, so Divers knew better than to mess with her. He barely even acknowledged Marksen as she climbed up a ladder from the lower decks and slid into the chair next to him, his eyes never leaving the bank of virtual screens that hovered over his station.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re early,\\u201d she said, firing up her own set of screens.\\n\\n\\u201cGot tired of the movie they were running in the mess club.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cCouldn\\u2019t tell. They all kind of look the same.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSailor\\u2019s lament,\\u201d she sighed, hitting a button to record for the log. \\u201cMarksen, Karen J. Assuming watch, 1200 hours. Divers, Bryan T. attending. Request identity confirmation.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI do so confirm,\\u201d Divers said.\\n\\n\\u201cThank God for that,\\u201d Marksen said, closing out the entry. \\u201cFor a second there, I thought I might have to shoot you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnything to break up the routine.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNumber three just completed a self-diagnostic,\\u201d Divers told her, his hands a blur as they moved across his console. \\u201cChip alpha-tango-seven-niner in array fourteen reports an impending fail and will need replacing. Oh, and there was a minor interference pattern that briefly triggered a breach mode before the core figured out what was going on and corrected itself.\\u201d\\n\\nMarksen called up the event on her console and studied the figures for a moment.\\n\\n\\u201cWere you able to pinpoint the exact source?\\u201d she asked.\\n\\n\\u201cClose enough to make it an easy call. It\\u2019s probably just a feedback surge coming off the pings from our own substation. Back at tech we used to call it a curly ghost. We\\u2019d see them pop off from time to time.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHmm,\\u201d Marksen mused. She didn\\u2019t really sound concerned\\u2014just bored and like she was looking for any kind of relief. \\u201cWhat was the duration of the breach?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAround 1.2257853 nanoseconds\\u2014or thereabouts.\\u201d He smiled a bit, amused at the mountain she was building out of this molehill. \\u201cIt really was no big deal, lieutenant. We flood the system with maintenance traffic all the time. Some of it just came back on us and got mistaken for an outside incursion, that\\u2019s all.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019d still feel better if one of us checked it out,\\u201d she said, hopping out of her chair. \\u201cI\\u2019ll take a tricorder with me just to make sure it isn\\u2019t something that could turn into a persistent leak. Could be we\\u2019ve got some bad shielding down there.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t worry about it too much,\\u201d Divers pointed out. \\u201cThe kind of surge we\\u2019re talking about doesn\\u2019t pack enough juice to cook popcorn.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen humor me,\\u201d Marksen ordered, heading for the hatch. It opened with a little hiss as the self-contained atmosphere depressurized with the rest of the cabin. \\u201cBesides, it\\u2019s not like we have anything better to do.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSince you\\u2019re going down there anyway, should I alert engineering so that you guys can replace that faulty chip?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMight as well,\\u201d Marksen agreed. \\u201cWhy should we have all the fun?\\u201d\\n\\nAnd with a friendly salute, the lieutenant was on her way. Divers shook his head, but consoled himself knowing that at least the exercise wasn\\u2019t a complete waste of time. He rang up engineering, expecting to hear some tool pusher on the other end. Instead he got Commander La Forge, who apparently had the nasty habit of answering his own calls. Divers gave him a rundown of the situation, which actually intrigued the chief engineer\\u2014although God only knew why. La Forge got so worked up he even volunteered to meet Marksen in SFSA himself. After all, it wasn\\u2019t every day he got to play detective with a curly ghost.\\n\\nClosing out, Divers sank bank into his chair and sighed.\\n\\nOfficers, he lamented. What can you do?\\n\\nBut he had no idea of the chain of events he had just set into motion.\\n\\nThe Ponsak swam in the liquid darkness that enveloped the computer core. In complete isolation, possessing a singularity of purpose, the creature might have felt completely alone in the universe\\u2014supposing that it had the capacity to feel anything. As it was, the Ponsak merely existed as a force without reason: action and reaction, driven by pure instinct, its directives hard-coded in its DNA. It never even occurred to the creature that its appearance might have created an infinitesimal distortion in the subspace field generated by the core, or that such a disturbance could have been detected. It merely proceeded, like a virus attacking its host, aware of nothing that didn\\u2019t immediately stand in its way.\\n\\nThe core itself was mammoth, rising a full two decks from base to apex. The Ponsak circled around the cylindrical face until it found a hard-link access panel, precisely where the starship\\u2019s schematics said it would be. Opening a compartment in its body armor, the Ponsak then retrieved the small device given to it by Captain Quintax. The creature had only a rudimentary understanding of how the Black Box worked, but had memorized every detail of its deployment. As the Ponsak affixed the device to the access panel, a tiny control pad appeared on its face. With a single touch, it engaged\\u2014and began the delicate process of inserting itself through the optical interface, the very gateway into the wider network.\\n\\nThe Ponsak, for its part, waited.\\n\\nA progress indicator ticked away the seconds, rising steadily until it completed the interface. The Ponsak then drilled down through the almost endless layers of information manipulated by the core, finally locating the controls for the ship\\u2019s orbital maneuvering system. Using a preprogrammed routine, it tied the box into those controls. All that remained was to lock everything down with a complex code series\\u2014\\n\\nThe Ponsak stopped, its movements frozen to absolute zero. Senses deviating from its immediate task, the creature expanded its sphere of awareness outward in circles until it detected the source of this new threat.\\n\\nIt waited to see if the human would go past, but calculated the odds as being unlikely. This area of the ship was restricted, and those who entered had a specific reason to be here. True to logic, the human stopped outside the access hatch and dialed in a key code. The hatch then popped open with a soft hiss\\u2014but the sound may as well have been a bullet, for all the potential violence it summoned.\\n\\nRetreating farther into the shadows, the Ponsak made like a hole in the dark.\\n\\nAnd prepared its butcher\\u2019s tools for work.\\n\\nMarksen watched the hatch slide open, light spilling into the core from behind her.\\n\\nHer own shadow fell across the floor, the shape of her body elongating to ghastly proportions as it mirrored her movements\\u2014a disconcerting effect that set her nerves on edge, though she couldn\\u2019t quite fathom why. Marksen had been here dozens of times and never paid it much mind, but all of a sudden she realized how isolated this place was. A person could scream and there wouldn\\u2019t be another soul to hear it\\u2014only the stark, imposing face of the core itself, which neither understood or cared. A person could die down here, and nobody would know it for hours or even days.\\n\\nMarksen chided herself for even thinking it, but still had to suppress a shudder before she could even walk inside. The atmosphere was frigid and dry, like nighttime in the desert, except for the utter sterility of the elements therein. They seemed to draw the life from her as she breathed them in, the core responding with quickening pulses of pseudolight that coursed through its stacks of isolinear chips. The sight of it filled Marksen with a vague dread of being watched, even beckoned, while her instincts pleaded with her to go the other way.\\n\\nGet a hold of yourself.\\n\\nOnly then did Marksen realize that she had been standing by the open doorway, no more than two steps in, steadying herself against the closest bulkhead. The droning of the ship filled her ears, giving her a handle on reality, and Marksen allowed it to clear her head. Reminding herself why she was here, she then reached for the tricorder she had picked up on her way down, peeling it off her belt and feeling the weight of it in her hands. It felt good and solid\\u2014a simple piece of tech, which answered with an affirmative tone as she flipped open the cover.\\n\\nJust get it done, she thought, and started scanning.\\n\\nThe tiny screen bathed her face in a pale green glow, the readings that appeared there strangely comforting. They didn\\u2019t show her much that she didn\\u2019t already know: the strong, proximal curve of a subspace field, modulations of energy states that propagated data along FTL routes\\u2014but all of it was neatly contained, with not a stray impulse to be found. Not a single sign of the \\u201ccurly ghost\\u201d Divers had described.\\n\\nThe voice jolted Marksen so hard she nearly dropped the tricorder. Clutching the device to her chest, she abruptly turned to see Commander La Forge approaching from the outside corridor. He ran to her side and took her by the arm, the concern on his face apparent even behind the VISOR that covered his eyes.\\n\\n\\u201cTake it easy there,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou okay?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d she blurted, still catching her breath. \\u201cSorry about that, commander. I must be a little jumpy today.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI have that affect on people.\\u201d\\n\\nMarksen laughed. Aside from Divers, Geordi La Forge was probably the least threatening man she knew\\u2014a fact only underscored by the warm smile he showed her. \\u201cTalk about weird,\\u201d she said, her fear dissipating to a tingle now that she was no longer alone. \\u201cYou ever walk into a room and just get the creeps?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou are ghost hunting,\\u201d La Forge told her, putting down a tool box that he had brought with him. \\u201cAnd let\\u2019s just say that I\\u2019ve seen a few corners of this ship that would make a great spot for a Halloween party.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cCount me in on the next one.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJust don\\u2019t tell the captain,\\u201d he joked. \\u201cSo did you find anything?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNot a whole a lot,\\u201d Marksen replied, handing him the tricorder. \\u201cShielding looks good, though we might be getting sporadic leaks off that faulty chip.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGood an explanation as any,\\u201d the chief engineer agreed, handing the device back. \\u201cStill, the tricorder can miss readings at the extreme ends of the subspace spectrum.\\u201d He tapped the side of his VISOR. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why I like to eyeball it.\\u201d\\n\\nMarksen smiled, and watched curiously as La Forge did his own scan of the area around the core. Methodically, he turned his gaze from one end to the other, moving in sweeps so that he could take it all in. \\u201cSo far so good,\\u201d he observed. \\u201cWhich array was giving you a problem?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s topside,\\u201d La Forge said, craning to get a look near the ceiling. \\u201cIf that is the source, then it should stand out pretty clear against the conventional EM\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nThe pause was unnatural. It filled the space between them with a mounting silence, building on an exponential curve. Marksen felt a stab of terror, sudden and irresistible\\u2014but not from within. This time it was real, and coming from the direction of La Forge\\u2019s stare.\\n\\nThe engineer frowned. \\u201cWhat the hell is that?\\u201d\\n\\nAnd with blinding speed, the terror fell upon them.\\n\\nLa Forge heard himself shout a warning out to Marksen, right before something savage clawed at him from out of the dark. The impact struck him squarely in the side of the head, reanimating his optic nerves with a bloom of stars and pain as it ripped his VISOR loose. He felt his forehead opening up like a seam, blood pouring into his useless eyes, his hands going up in front of his face in a useless attempt to protect himself. By, then, however, his attacker had moved on to other targets. Two quick jabs to his abdomen made him double over, gasping for breath, before another blow knocked his legs out from under him. La Forge crumpled, crashing into the deck so hard he could hear his bones rattle.\\n\\nThe most amazing force clamped down on the sides of his head. La Forge felt fingers digging into his skull, though it seemed impossible that anyone could be that strong. Fresh pain seeped into his brain like a hot flood, the rest of his body trivial by comparison. Unable to think, he reacted on instinct, tearing at the hands that held him\\u2014but then recoiled against them, so violently that he gagged. The touch was so monstrous, so reptilian, it branded him as unclean even as it squeezed the life out of him.\\n\\noh god oh dear god this thing\\u2019s not alive\\n\\nthis thing holding me touching me is not alive it\\u2019s dead\\n\\nA woman\\u2019s voice: \\u201cDivers! Emergency! We have an intruder\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nThe hands let go, dropping him to the floor.\\n\\nLa Forge heaved, spitting out blood as he rolled onto his side. Conscious thought pierced his mind like a hot lance, matching the agony that his body felt. Why hadn\\u2019t his attacker killed him? It would have been so easy, and La Forge would have welcomed it.\\n\\nThen he heard Marksen screaming, and the reason because crystal.\\n\\nHe groped for the device in a clumsy stupor, fingers dragging across the deck and tearing out his nails. La Forge paid it no heed. The only thing worse than facing the walking dead was facing it in blindness\\u2014and knowing that it had dispensed with him only to go after Marksen. The nightmare of having to sit and listen while that thing did to her what it did to him swelled up in his imagination like a tsunami rolling into shore, because in his mind\\u2019s eye he wouldn\\u2019t be blind at all. Because in his mind\\u2019s eye his imagination would see everything\\u2014\\n\\nThen a slow, gurgling sound. The snapping of wet twigs.\\n\\nLa Forge froze. The silence of the grave descended upon him.\\n\\n\\u201cLieutenant?\\u201d he called, reaching a hand out into the void.\\n\\nA blast of warm, viscous droplets sprayed La Forge in the face. He didn\\u2019t need to see it or taste it to know what it was. The sound of Marksen\\u2019s body, collapsing in a heap next to him, only confirmed that this blood was not his own.\\n\\nBut it would be soon enough. The walking dead would see to that.\\n\\nLa Forge opened up his soul and screamed.\\n\\nSecurity got the call from a frantic crewman. The ship\\u2019s computer routed it to the nearest standby team, where a master chief by the name of Costa answered. He listened closely, trying hard just to make out the crewman\\u2019s name\\u2014Danvers or something like that\\u2014but the voice on the other end was terrified beyond comprehension, babbling so fast that the chief barely understood. He only managed to pick out bits and pieces, fragmented by the sound of a battering ram against a steel door\\u2014until a loud screech burst in, and the voice shouted for the last time.\\n\\nThen the channel cut out. Static and then silence.\\n\\nCosta jumped onto a nearby console, tracing the call to its point of origin. His display highlighted a small area on Deck 31, identifying the section: Subspace Field Systems Access. He tried to raise the crewman again, but nobody answered. That was all Costa needed to know.\\n\\nAlerting the squad on duty, he went over to the armory and punched an access code into the electronic lock. The door slid open as his people arrived, all ten of them filing in one at a time and outfitting themselves with the required equipment: Type II handheld phasers for everyone, with a Type I for use as a backup. Costa did the same, strapping the weapons to his belt and heading out after them\\u2014but then stopped when something else caught his eye.\\n\\nThere, bolted to the wall, was a heavy phaser rifle. The chief thought about it for a moment, remembering the sheer terror he heard in that voice.\\n\\n\\u201cScrew it,\\u201d he said, and grabbed the rifle.\\n\\nAs Costa walked back into the security station, the others noticed the firepower he had slung over his shoulder. They all exchanged the same look, and knew it was bad.\\n\\n\\u201cTime to earn that paycheck,\\u201d the chief said, and led them out to fight.\\n\\nThe Ponsak ran like the devil, no longer concerned with remaining invisible. Anyone it encountered now would be killed\\u2014the equation was as simple as that. Its first priority had been to neutralize the crewman in SFSA. The woman in the core had managed to warn him before the Ponsak disposed of her, creating the very real danger that the core would be taken offline before the Black Box could be fully activated. With SFSA secured, that was no longer a possibility. But there was still the matter of the Box itself, which was not yet ready. With security on the way, the Ponsak had only minutes to complete its mission. After that, it had only to defend its position\\u2014which it would do to the death.\\n\\nIt slipped back into the confines of the core, bypassing the human who still lived. The Ponsak had quickly decided that the human was a minimal threat at this point, and that even the scant few seconds required to finish him off was too much of a delay. Instead, it bounded up the side of the wall like a gigantic insect, once more up toward the ceiling where the Black Box waited. Only a few more keystrokes and its very existence would be complete.\\n\\nAnd it would have all the time in the world to kill.\\n\\nLieutenant Worf routed an Enterprise schematic to the bridge\\u2019s main viewscreen, which showed the engineering core flashing in red. Immediately around it, section dividers also flashed yellow, showing the areas being secured by approaching forces. The Klingon had wasted no time assigning full complements\\u2014not after hearing the distress call. Captain Picard, for his part, hadn\\u2019t argued with him.\\n\\n\\u201cAll security teams reporting in,\\u201d Worf said, reading off his panel. \\u201cDecks 30 through 37 have been evacuated to within five sections of the computer core.\\u201d\\n\\nPicard walked up the ramp that led to the rear of the bridge, joining Worf at the tactical station. The captain watched as moving green dots, which represented each member of the teams, approached the core from both fore and aft on all seven decks. They formed a perimeter around the evacuated sections and then stopped.\\n\\n\\u201cYes. Specialist David Divers, the one who made the call to security\\u2014and Lieutenant Sharon Marksen, who was also on the core duty roster.\\u201d Worf paused for a long moment, and then finally added, \\u201cEngineering reports that Lieutenant Commander La Forge went there ten minutes ago. He is not responding to calls.\\u201d\\n\\nMy God, Picard thought, but kept it to himself. He ran over the scenarios, none of them good. Sensors were useless around the core because the shielding there was too thick, so there was no way to tell if any of them were alive; and even if they were, beaming them out of there was out of the question for the very same reason. Picard shuddered at the thought of what he had to do next\\u2014but as captain, he knew there was no other way to protect the safety of his ship.\\n\\nAt least until we know what the hell is going on.\\n\\n\\u201cEngage the emergency doors,\\u201d he ordered. \\u201cSeal off all sections within the evacuation perimeter. Nobody but the security teams goes in or out.\\u201d\\n\\nCosta read the words stenciled into the bulkhead, the stark, bold lettering that he had seen a hundred times before now conveying the malevolence of the unknown. He signaled for his people to stop, then leveled the sights of his phaser rifle down the short distance that remained between him and SFSA. Tight sweeps on the infra-red detected nothing but empty space, the motion sensor keyed to his spyglass totally still. Even so, the sensor on the back of Costa\\u2019s neck tingled\\u2014and he trusted that a hell of a lot more than any electronic gear. Something was out there, taunting him and daring him to enter.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s right. I can see you but you can\\u2019t see me.\\n\\nHe took a step forward, clinging as close as he could to the wall. Out in front of him, the corridor bent to the left, cutting off his line of sight just short of the hatch that marked his objective.\\n\\nI could be anywhere. Maybe right next to you.\\n\\n\\u201cDammit,\\u201d Costa swore under his breath. He repositioned himself, rifle trained on the kill zone in front of him, but there was no way of seeing without sticking his head out. After that, it was all or nothing.\\n\\nIf you make it that far. If I don\\u2019t take your head off first\\u2026\\n\\nThe chief blinked the sweat from his eyes. Behind him, spaced about two meters apart, the other members of his team took cover behind the archways that led back toward the turbolift. All of them stood at the ready, their bodies like tight coils poised to strike, phasers leveled to give maximum protection to the man walking point. Costa trusted them with his life, and knew they would take down any threat before it could get close to him\\u2014but still, this felt like something else. This felt like something different.\\n\\nThe team stood by, waiting for Costa to make a decision.\\n\\nSteeling his will, the chief thrust himself out in the open. He already had a heavy pull on his rifle\\u2019s trigger, imagining the hell of phaser fire he would unleash on the first thing that twitched\\u2014but when nothing materialized, he gave the rest of the team the signal to go in. Moving in two-by-two formations, they quickly followed Costa\\u2019s lead and closed the last few meters to SFSA. There, they formed a tight cordon, weapons leveled at the entrance.\\n\\nCosta didn\\u2019t even need to look back at his team to know they were ready.\\n\\nOne step at a time, he inched over to the hatch\\u2014or what was left of it. Once a heavy, pressurized door, it had been dented inwards by some incredible force. Costa couldn\\u2019t spot any blast marks, which meant someone had gone in the hard way. He tried not to think about what could cause that kind of damage, though even his rifle now seemed like a piss poor defense against whatever it was. More than that, it would be a goddamn miracle if they could keep this thing contained.\\n\\nHolding his breath, Costa reached out and gave the door a push.\\n\\nIt swung in, giving some resistance on the other side. He tried again, harder this time, but it still wouldn\\u2019t give way. Motioning to the others, Costa positioned two of them on both sides of the entryway. Then, stepping back with his weapon at the ready, he had one of them give the door a pull. It opened slowly with a long, mournful groan\\u2014a sound like the rusted hinges of a mausoleum, with the smell of death closely behind it.\\n\\nAnd a body spilled out into the corridor.\\n\\nCosta jumped back, as the corpse\\u2019s arm flopped down near his boots. It was the only part that still looked remotely human. The rest looked like it had gone through a shredder, the remains of its uniform sliced to ribbons along with the flesh beneath. What remained of the face was even less recognizable, having been pried off and leaving behind a mostly empty skull\\u2014as if some savage hand had simply reached in and scooped it out. Worse that that, however, was the utter lack of blood. All of the wounds had been neatly cauterized, adding an insane sterility to the unspeakable violence.\\n\\nStepping over the body, the chief jammed the business end of his rifle into the confined space beyond the door. In less than two seconds, he confirmed that SFSA was secure. Whatever had carved up the poor bastard had moved on. He then went back and plucked the comm badge off the dead man\\u2019s chest, reading the name embossed on the device.\\n\\n\\u201cDivers,\\u201d Costa said. \\u201cMust be the guy who phoned it in.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGot us a bad one,\\u201d someone else added. \\u201cWhat is this thing, chief?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m more worried about where it is.\\u201d Costa tried sensors again, picking up signatures on every member of his team, but beyond that only noise. Giving up on that line, he tuned his own senses to the air: electricity infused with fear, the kind of thing that made his hairs stand on end. It was still around\\u2014of that he was certain.\\n\\nCosta also knew he had to draw it out.\\n\\nUnless I draw you out first.\\n\\nAnd then, from a short distance away, something else.\\n\\nEveryone tensed. Everyone heard it\\u2014but the words had been so weak, so ephemeral, that belief came hard. Only dead silence could coax that sound back from the deep, and when they heard it again there was no room for doubt.\\n\\nCosta shot a glance down the corridor, in the direction of that plea. There was only one possible place from which it could have come.\\n\\n\\u201cThe core,\\u201d he told the others, and ran toward it.\\n\\nAlert lights flashed above the entrance to the computer core, conspiring with the darkness inside to create a hellish red glow. Costa detected the smell of charred flesh as the team approached, a smoky haze still hanging heavy over the entirety of the section. Costa went in first, crouching in a defensive position while the others poured in behind him. And there, as his eyes adjusted to the gloom, he took in the full scale of what had happened.\\n\\nThe core was a veritable chamber of horrors.\\n\\nUnlike the comparatively clean kill back in SFSA, this place had been rendered in an orgy of blood. Spatter was everywhere, forming helter-skelter patterns on the walls and chip arrays, more blood than seemed possible in a dozen human bodies. Costa swallowed his own gag reflex, trying to stay sharp as he swept the much larger space for signs of movement. He stopped suddenly on one area of the bulkhead, thinking he saw the outline of a person\\u2014until he realized with sickening clarity that the shape had been blasted there in an outline of gore and loose tissue. Beneath that, he found the source: two more corpses, laying in a viscous, spreading pool that appeared more black than red.\\n\\nExcept that one of them stirred.\\n\\nThe chief moved in. He checked the body that didn\\u2019t move\\u2014a woman laying face down on the deck\\u2014and quickly determined that she was dead. He then went to the other one\\u2014a man with an engineering insignia, the pins on his collar indicating a rank of lieutenant commander. Only when Costa turned him over did he see the milky white of the man\\u2019s eyes, his features bruised but unmistakable.\\n\\n\\u201cCommander La Forge,\\u201d Costa told him. \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay. We\\u2019ve got you.\\u201d\\n\\nLa Forge\\u2019s useless eyes fluttered, his head lolling back and forth.\\n\\n\\u201cNo, no, no,\\u201d the chief engineer babbled, half delirious. \\u201cNo, it can\\u2019t be. This can\\u2019t be happening. Lieutenant Marksen\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re here to help,\\u201d Costa said, trying to calm him down. \\u201cBut we need to get you out of here first.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd Costa had to know.\\n\\nLa Forge slumped back, and spoke in a voice that was not his own.\\n\\nThe chief felt La Forge\\u2019s shock drain into him. From there it filled the entire core, like tentacles wrapping around each member of his team, the living only one heartbeat removed from the dead. Somehow, one of them found the commander\\u2019s VISOR and handed it to Costa. Turning the thing over in his hands, Costa could only imagine the horrors it had drilled into La Forge\\u2019s brain before coming off.\\n\\nBut La Forge wanted it back. He reached for it, knowing it was there.\\n\\nCosta gave the VISOR to him. La Forge snapped it into place, and a moment rose to his own two feet. He refused help, instead steadying himself against the bulkhead until he regained some of his strength. No longer blind, no longer tentative, he then straightened himself out and took in everything around him.\\n\\nThe security team, watching him in trepidation.\\n\\nThe woman\\u2019s body, still in death but by no means peaceful.\\n\\nAnd finally himself, his uniform soaked in blood.\\n\\nBut none of that could compare. Not to the realization of horror that dawned across La Forge\\u2019s face, manifesting itself in a slow, deliberate turn toward the doorway. Costa followed that gaze, as did the others, to find them all trapped\\u2014blocked by a figure more shadow than substance, but unquestionably real in its intentions. It appeared humanoid, but Costa knew better. This was the devil of which La Forge spoke, revealing itself in full.\\n\\nAnd pulled the trigger while he still could.\", \"author\": \"Marc Giller\", \"url\": \"https://noqreport.com/2020/01/27/star-trek-shadow-prime-book-i-chapter-11/\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 15:00:42 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580155242, \"collection_utc\": 1580172402}",News,1580155242

If you\\u2019ve ever wondered what Star Trek would be like as a modern, Tom Clancy-esque techno-thriller, you\\u2019ve come to the right place. Just in case you\\u2019ve missed the previous installments, you can find them here:\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, if you like this book and want to see it in print, ping Simon & Schuster and Pocket Books on social media and let them know!\\n\\nThe small patch of real estate carved out of the south side of the metroplex had been set aside by the Bezzeret as the Federation\\u2019s operational zone (called OZ on the official maps), but to the small community of scientists and support personnel who lived there it was known as Skid Row\\u2014a modest collection of modular buildings, each one indistinguishable from the others, deposited there by the Starfleet Corps of Engineers when they cobbled the facilities together eight years ago. In that time they had not aged well, taking on the characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood\\u2014a rather seedy part of town as those things went in this day and age, populated by the lower-caste types that always seemed to exist at the fringes of an industrial society, doing the menial jobs that the upper caste would just as soon forget. Flanked by distribution hubs and warehouses, the place didn\\u2019t have much going for it\\u2014just a few shops that sold cheap knock-off goods to offworlders and a dive bar that passed itself off as an exotic cabaret; but the Bezzeret allowed the Federation to conduct itself there more or less autonomously, and the locals\\u2014grateful for the influx of business\\u2014rarely made trouble for their guests.\\n\\nWill Riker sensed it even before he materialized inside the zone, like a heat wave of raw emotion spilling over the border that marked the edge of friendly territory. So did Bev Crusher, who tensed the moment she came out of the matter stream, both of them taking in their surroundings to pinpoint the source. It wasn\\u2019t hard to find. An angry native crowd, milling about outside the compound, bristled at the sight of them\\u2014two more invaders to complement the dozens of others who had beamed down ahead of them as part of the advance team.\\n\\n\\u201cWarm welcome,\\u201d Bev Crusher remarked, having dropped in next to him. \\u201cThink they\\u2019ll ask us to stay for dinner?\\u201d\\n\\nRiker looked the crowd over, searching for signs of real danger. The gathering was hardly what he would have called a riot, but he could see the hate in their eyes nonetheless.\\n\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t plan on being here that long,\\u201d he replied. \\u201cCome on.\\u201d\\n\\nThe two of them made their way through a flurry of activity, toward the center of the compound where most of the action was taking place. Uniformed crewmen from Enterprise pitched in with the resident civilian researchers, taking down what was left of the complex. They loaded everything they could into the large transport containers that Riker had sent down, battering most of the equipment in their haste\\u2014not that the commander took issue. His orders on the matter had been very clear: Get in, get out, do it fast. All other considerations secondary. The only exception were the Level 5 biologicals, which Beverly was here to handle. Bad as things were, an accident involving some nasty pathogen would only make things worse\\u2014and the captain had been quite specific about not making things worse.\\n\\nHe and Beverly turned in the direction of a harried but booming voice, belonging to what could have been the fattest man Riker had ever seen. He bounded toward them faster than what should have been possible, so epic in girth that it seemed he couldn\\u2019t be human; but as he finally arrived, the man revealed himself to be just that\\u2014genteel and with a good humor that made Riker take an instant liking to him.\\n\\n\\u201cWelcome to Skid Row,\\u201d the man huffed, his face beet red but managing to squeeze out a smile between rivulets of sweat. \\u201cOr at least what\\u2019s left of it. Your people came ready to party, I\\u2019ll hand you that.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe aim to please,\\u201d Riker said, shaking his hand. \\u201cAre you Dr. Morton?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cResident xenosociologist,\\u201d Morton replied, \\u201cwhich is a fancy way of saying I don\\u2019t work for a living. Please call me Alex.\\u201d He then turned to Beverly. \\u201cNow I know what you\\u2019re thinking, Dr. Crusher\\u2014so before you whip out that tricorder, I\\u2019ll have you know that I\\u2019ve actually lost over twenty kilos since getting marooned on this rock. Check my file if you don\\u2019t believe me.\\u201d\\n\\nBeverly laughed. \\u201cThe food here must be terrible.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOne of the many things I won\\u2019t miss,\\u201d he affirmed, motioning toward their growing audience outside the compound. \\u201cYou get a chance to meet the neighbors? They\\u2019ve been a bit frisky as of late.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey\\u2019re mostly good people,\\u201d Morton continued, \\u201cbut with a few professional agitators thrown in the mix. The government likes to keep things stirred up, if you know what I mean. Makes it easier to blame outsiders for all their problems.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSo we\\u2019ve seen,\\u201d Beverly said, zipping up her jacket to ward off the early morning desert chill\\u2014but not before Morton noticed the Type II phaser holstered underneath. He didn\\u2019t appear surprised, just mildly amused.\\n\\n\\u201cSure your last name ain\\u2019t Holliday?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYou ought to see the rest of her kit,\\u201d Riker said drily. \\u201cAre any of your people armed?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAgainst the law,\\u201d Morton replied, \\u201ceven for citizens. The government also likes to keep everyone on a short leash.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cStill, it might be a good idea,\\u201d Riker decided. \\u201cI\\u2019d feel a lot better knowing we had an edge, especially if things get out of hand.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe local constabulary might take issue with that.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cFrag \\u2018em. The Bezzeret don\\u2019t get to make all the rules.\\u201d\\n\\nMorton grinned. \\u201cGlad to have you on our side, commander.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cLikewise\\u2014\\u201d Riker began, but got cut off by a piercing shriek that stabbed across the grounds. He reacted instantly, turning in the direction of the sound\\u2014knowing on an instinctive level that it wasn\\u2019t human, but recognizing the rage contained within just the same. Beverly did the same, hand dropping to her weapon as she looked back toward the entrance of the compound, where they saw a throng of Bezzeret protestors now pouring through. Riker had no idea what set them off, but at least as many Federation personnel surged in to meet them. With the two waves fast converging, God only knew what would happen when they hit.\\n\\n\\u201cDammit,\\u201d Riker seethed, heading straight into the fracas with Beverly on his six. Morton did his best to keep up, but quickly fell behind in the swell of bodies as the two officers pushed their way through. \\u201cMake a hole!\\u201d Riker shouted, barely able to hear himself over the crowd, which only grew louder and more rambunctious the deeper he went. By now, everyone was itching for a fight\\u2014himself included, even though he didn\\u2019t quite know why.\\n\\nThen he reached the center of the storm, and saw for himself.\\n\\nThere, in the no man\\u2019s land between the two opposing factions, one of Morton\\u2019s people \\u2014a woman, no less\\u2014faced off against a Bezzeret. The two circled each other, already dusted up and bloodied from more than a few traded blows. Morton\\u2019s girl held her own, though, getting some jabs in as her much taller opponent swung at her.\\n\\n\\u201cCome on, you stringy bastard,\\u201d she taunted. \\u201cThat the best you got?\\u201d\\n\\nThe Bezzeret bared his teeth, emitting a low growl\\u2014the same bestial tone Riker had heard before. The sound of it made his blood run cold, almost as much as the dull glow behind the Bezzeret\\u2019s eyes.\\n\\nAnd Riker knew: He\\u2019ll kill her if he gets the chance.\\n\\nThe woman, agile as she was, didn\\u2019t fully realize the danger. Dropping her guard only for a second, she gave the Bezzeret the opening he needed. He lunged, moving unbelievably fast, fingers hooked into claws and reaching for her neck. Somehow the woman saw it coming, and pivoted her body to the left to avoid what would have been a fatal strike. But her shoulder took the brunt instead, the impact spinning her around and stuffing her face-first into the ground. She pushed herself up, scrambling to get clear, but the Bezzeret grabbed her by the sides of the head\\u2014his powerful hands squeezing her skull, determined to crush it.\\n\\nBoth men went flying, a tangle of limbs thrashing against one another. Riker held the advantage, though, rolling away and jumping up before the dazed Bezzeret knew what was happening. He then crouched, ready to go on offense again as the Bezzeret clambered back to his feet. This time the alien hissed, an altogether demonic sound, and Riker saw the hell fire behind those eyes directed at him. Clearly, this wasn\\u2019t going to end until one of them was dead\\u2014and the crowd, now worked to an absolute frenzy, expected nothing less.\\n\\nUntil the scream of a phaser silenced them.\\n\\nThe beam struck the Bezzeret squarely in the chest, so hard that it knocked him back several meters. He crumpled to the ground a twitching mass, his body racked by stray electrical impulses, though his moans left no doubt that he was still alive. The phaser had only been set to stun\\u2014but jacked to a high enough level to hurt. Riker had to admire the shooter\\u2019s style.\\n\\nThe crowd parting, he saw Beverly level her weapon at the other protesters.\\n\\nSomething in her tone made the Bezzeret take heed. They retreated a few steps, helping their comrade up, but then regained enough courage to stand their ground. That was when Morton arrived, even more winded than before, and sized up the situation in that canny way of his. Kneeling down to assist the woman from his team, he looked up at Beverly and then towards Riker.\\n\\n\\u201cIs this what you meant by out of hand?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\nThe Bezzeret also waited on Riker\\u2019s answer. He could tell that they were on the edge, and that the slightest push could nudge them either way. He thought about drawing his own phaser, matching Beverly\\u2019s show of force, but instinct made him reconsider. This was a brawl, not a battle\\u2014and he had already seized the initiative with his fists.\\n\\n\\u201cI will have order!\\u201d he shouted, in a voice that would have made his drill instructor at the Academy proud. \\u201cYou people will disperse immediately so we can finish our work. Anybody who interferes,\\u201d he trailed off, leveling an acid scowl at the stunned Bezzeret. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve already seen what happens.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Bezzeret chattered amongst themselves, still uncertain.\\n\\n\\u201cMake it hard on us,\\u201d Riker prodded, \\u201cwe\\u2019ll make it even harder on you.\\u201d\\n\\nThey exchanged a few glances, searching for a leader. None arose.\\n\\n\\u201cSo what\\u2019s it going to be?\\u201d\\n\\nThe heat that fed the Bezzeret frenzy settled into a slow burn. Gradually, they began to disperse\\u2014including the one Beverly shot, who hobbled away with the aid of his friends, his pride wounded more than anything else. He spat at Riker\\u2019s feet as he went past, muttering something in his native language that cast a ripple of assent among the others.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\\u201d Riker asked.\\n\\n\\u201cHumans go home,\\u201d Morton translated, dusting off his knees as he and Beverly came over. They watched the Bezzeret retreat, which extended back to the compound\\u2019s perimeter, but went no farther. There they remained, like a storm hanging just off shore, replenishing their fury for next time. \\u201cIf it\\u2019s all the same to you, I\\u2019d like like to grant their wish. The best view of this place will be in the rear view mirror\\u2014preferably with a beer in hand.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI heard that,\\u201d Riker agreed, and started to walk with Beverly and Morton toward the operations shack. Enterprise had already started beaming cargo up, the large carriers dematerializing in the courtyard as they went by. \\u201cWe got the manifest for all your gear, but I\\u2019m thinking we ought to prioritize. As long as we get the vital stuff first, we can leave the rest of it behind if things deteriorate any more than they already have.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey can bill me,\\u201d the commander retorted, turning to Beverly. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s our time frame for securing the biologicals?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThree hours,\\u201d she answered. \\u201cTwo if we really push it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTwo hours,\\u201d Riker grumbled. \\u201cNot even enough time for a poker game.\\u201d It was, however, a lot more time than he wanted to spend here, with all those Bezzeret eyes watching. And the protestors outside the grounds were only the beginning. There might well be even more of them, staring down from the ramshackle buildings of Skid Row, waiting for some signal to attack. Plenty of places to hide in there, Riker thought, feeling more vulnerable than ever before. If it came down to actually defending this place, he had no idea how the hell to do it.\\n\\n\\u201cMove like you got a purpose,\\u201d he ordered.\\n\\nThe volume of computer activity that takes place on board starship is considerable. In fact, the burden placed on its computer cores are of such magnitude and importance that the use of conventional processing elements is impossible\\u2014they are simply too slow. To answer these demands, a network which makes use of optical transtator clusters made up of thousands of faster than light nanoprocessor units was developed to become the \\u201cnervous system\\u201d of a starship. In essence, the same theory which made warp drive a working reality was applied to generating a subspace field within this network, thus allowing the ship\\u2019s computer to process information at faster than light speeds. Not only did this arrangement free the designers from the confines of real space processing, it also saved a lot of headaches by eliminating the need to support the almost absolute-zero temperatures required by conventional superconductors.\\n\\nThe principle was efficient, stable and had been in use for nearly 200 years. From an engineering standpoint, there was virtually no downside\\u2014except for one possibility that nearly everyone had overlooked.\\n\\nWhen the subject of catastrophic failure came up at the original project meetings, only one scientist\\u2014a multidimensional physicist named David Zeen\\u2014pointed out that there indeed was an Achilles Heel hidden within the system. A theoretician with an obsessive-compulsive streak, Zeen worried about everything\\u2014including the possibility that a subspace pulse of a certain magnitude could wreak havoc with the isolinear processors that were central to the core\\u2019s design. If the pulse were especially strong, it could effectively wipe them clean, like an eraser being dragged across a chalkboard.\\n\\nBy this time, of course, a great deal of time and money had already been spent on the original design. Implementing safeguards against the kind of event Zeen postulated would have set the project back by several months, if not a year or more. Further undermining his argument was the simple fact that freak subspace pulses were almost unheard of in nature, outside of a supernova or the event horizon of a black hole\\u2014and if a starship ever got close enough to one of those, a computer failure would be the least of its problems. Accordingly, in true bureaucratic fashion, Zeen\\u2019s opinion was carefully noted and summarily discarded. Work proceeded on schedule and everyone went their separate ways.\\n\\nExcept that somewhere along the line, word trickled back to Starfleet Tactical. The rocket boys there had already been working on ways to screw with an enemy vessel\\u2019s warp drive by subjecting it to intense subspace fields, an effort that had yielded mixed results at best. The revelation that they could apply the same techniques more effectively to screwing with an enemy vessel\\u2019s computer\\u2014well, that seemed like the next best thing. And seeing as the department had already budgeted for the research, they didn\\u2019t need to go to the Federation for additional funding. Not only was this cost-conscious, it also allowed the admiral in charge to keep any new weapons that resulted off the books.\\n\\nSo began the development of what would become the Localized Conductive Subspace Interference Generator\\u2014LoConSIG for short, a rather clunky acronym that no one would ever use. In more vicious circles (and there were many), it was known as the Starship Killer. Euphemistically, it was called the Black Box\\u2014an overtly descriptive name, but like Pandora\\u2019s Box, one that gave no clue as to the deadly contents inside.\\n\\nIt is not a bomb, though it could be categorized as a weapon of mass destruction. A small, rectangular object, it measures 50cm by 30cm with no visible controls aside from a small programming pad on the topmost surface. The components are divided into two sub-systems: one is capable of rerouting computer systems and executing commands, while the other is a tiny but lethal static subspace field generator capable of delivering a whopping burst of 4500 millocochranes. In real time, the length of this burst is less than one-thousandth of a second\\u2014but it is enough to inflict fatal damage on a faster-than-light computer system.\\n\\nWhat David Zeen had envisioned as his worst nightmare, Tactical had made a working reality. Frightening as it was, though, the Black Box ultimately didn\\u2019t find much of a place for itself among the arsenal of more conventional weapons. Commonplace as they were, phasers and photon torpedoes could be used at a distance\\u2014you simply aimed at fired. Using the Black Box was a bit more complex, because it worked from the inside out. It had to be tied directly to a ship\\u2019s core interface, which meant someone had to beam aboard an enemy vessel to deploy it\\u2014and that, as they say, is easier said than done under combat conditions.\\n\\nWhat the Black Box could do effectively, however, was destroy a ship without leaving a trace of itself. With all of its other limitations, that left the weapon but with one real use: sabotage. Given the state of affairs in the Federation, though, and the Council\\u2019s general reluctance to authorize covert actions, that meant in all likelihood that the Black Box would spend its life gathering dust in some vault\\u2014an interesting proof of concept, but little more.\\n\\nStill, there were those who thought it wasn\\u2019t a bad thing to have around. Terrence Blake was such a man. From the moment he first saw the Black Box, he understood its potential. In fact, he had been so impressed with the device that he arranged to have several of them deployed in the field, each one in the hands of a trusted ally. It was a proactive move on his part\\u2014highly illegal, given the lack of Starfleet sanction, but a wise one nonetheless. Blake hadn\\u2019t risen up the chain of command by being caught unprepared, and the Black Box gave him an edge that nobody else had.\\n\\nBecause you never knew when you would have to destroy a ship in secret.\\n\\nEspecially one of your own.\\n\\nSteven Quintax felt strange, staring down into his empty hands. Only moments before, he had held the Black Box in them, pondering the sheer power and naked potential contained in such an innocuous package. Stranger still, he had handed it off without any hesitation at all\\u2014a transaction, more or less, like contraband between pirates, conducted in the secrecy of his quarters. Only now, left alone with his thoughts, did he begin to realize the magnitude of what he had set into motion.\\n\\nThe admiral would have done the same thing, Quintax kept telling himself. He always made the tough decisions. When he gets wind of this, he\\u2019ll know I did the right thing.\\n\\nSo why did his hands shake so badly?\\n\\nHe balled them into fists, trying to quell his angst, rocking back and forth but finding no peace in repetition. His conscience would simply not allow it\\u2014a conscience that had been notably absent in the presence of the Ponsak, who had taken the box from him and disappeared. Quintax knew where the creature was by now, though he could never fathom how; it was one of those things he chose not to question, for fear of where the answer might lead. He only knew that what he had started could not be stopped.\\n\\nAnd he would most certainly be damned for it.\\n\\nQuintax rocked some more, that thought actually giving him some measure of comfort. Perhaps hell wouldn\\u2019t be such a bad place after all\\u2014and there was a certain solace in knowing that it was his final destination. Still, Quintax couldn\\u2019t shake the image of Blake looking down at him, in pitiful disappointment: Zeus, with his all to familiar contempt for the weakness of mere mortals. Enterprise would make a fine enough burnt offering, wouldn\\u2019t she?\\n\\nQuintax, praying to his jealous god, begged for the strength to see it through.\\n\\n\\u201cThy will be done,\\u201d he whispered. \\u201cThy will be done.\\u201d\\n\\nThere was once a philosopher, not from Earth, who speculated that the nature of evil is not so much that which opposes good, but a void in which good cannot exist. Only within such a space is there room for evil, which itself is a vacuum. That which is nothingness appears from nothingness, and can thus become anything it wants to be\\u2014imparting to evil a remarkable flexibility, because it can assume any form that it wants. Good suffers from pretensions; evil does not. Accordingly, it is easy for evil to slip on past, unnoticed by human eyes, in willful blindness.\\n\\nSo it was from nothingness that the creature appeared\\u2014the same one that would haunt Steven Quintax in the few dreams that he had left, like a nightmare fringe that leaves no trace of itself in the morning, save a tingling, barely palpable sense of fear; the same creature which, because of its nature, was the perfect warrior\\u2014a thing with no name and no face and no identity, only a singularity of purpose. Like a distillation of evil, it held no pretense. And like an incarnation of evil, it walked the vessel\\u2019s corridors at the border between reality and terror, where no eye could see nor any sensor detect.\\n\\nIt heard the voices and felt the heartbeats of those it passed, taking in a brief taste of life with every encounter, watching them with a curiosity that wasn\\u2019t so much alive as it was existent. It brushed by a few of them, some even close enough to touch, perhaps stirring a detached sort of dread easily dismissed as nerves or fatigue, before moving on to its objective. Because nothing would keep it from its objective.\\n\\nThe creature was Ponsak, and this was its duty.\\n\\nThe information systems architecture of a Galaxy-class starship consists of three computer cores, two of which are located on the port and starboard sides of the primary hull, while the third resides deep within the secondary. Each provides load balancing and redundancy for its counterparts, the split arrangement also allowing the two hulls to operate independently of one another during separated flight. Although largely automated, the cores are constantly monitored by specialists posted in an adjoining substation known as Subspace Field System Access\\u2014or SFSA\\u2014which is designated as a vaulted area because of its critical importance to shipboard operations. Aside from the captain and the XO, only those assigned to SFSA are permitted to enter.\\n\\nDuty there isn\\u2019t considered the worst on board, but it comes close. The gray walls, dark lighting, mazes of isolinear chips, and the sparse interfaces don\\u2019t present a warm and welcome sight (someone once observed that the designers had hired the same interior decorator as the Borg). Coupled with the constant, semi-sentient hum radiating from the core chamber, the atmosphere seems to actively loathe any living thing that enters it. This effect is, of course, entirely psychological, but it manifests itself consistently enough so that shifts are rotated out every four hours\\u2014the shortest duration of any on board. Because of this, the rest of the crew tends to view SFSA specialists as a little squirrel y, better at talking to machines than to other human beings. The specialists, for their part, think even less of outsiders in return\\u2014but they know how to keep things running, so they rarely get asked any questions.\\n\\nUnder non-combat conditions, the job of monitoring the cores is the responsibility of a two-person team. The lead position is held by a commissioned officer, typically a lieutenant junior-grade, assisted by a petty officer second-class. Their routine is a simple one, consisting primarily of fine tuning, maintenance and watching a diagnostic feed\\u2014monkey work, as the hardcore systems jockeys liked to call it, but demanded under regulations. The rest of the time, the team functions as a backstop against any possible contingency. That\\u2019s a fancy way of saying they sit around waiting for something to go wrong\\u2014and even then, they\\u2019re a superfluous component at best. If one of the cores goes down, the others kick in automatically to take up the slack; and beyond that, if the unthinkable happened, a system of dedicated subprocessors could take over minimal operations in the event of a multiple core failure. In essence, the emergency would have occurred, been isolated, and addressed before the crew could even hit the alert button.\\n\\nBut protocol was protocol, and if it was anything that Jean-Luc Picard impressed upon his people it was the human factor involved in all phases of ship\\u2019s operations. No matter how well the engineers had designed her, Enterprise was not perfect, and it was up to her crew to remain sharp when the vessel herself couldn\\u2019t. Sure, it was a platitude\\u2014but it was an effective one, and kept people from going going batshit when it seemed like duty consisted solely of staring at a screen of endless figures and waiting for the chimes to ring so you could go up to Ten Forward and be glad that it was someone else\\u2019s turn.\\n\\nSometimes, though, it wore thin. With the skipper acting beyond strange and a general pall of tension hanging over the ship, it was easy to glance up at the clock and think an hour had passed and find that it had only been five minutes. Specialist Divers had seen more than his share of that lately, with the in-betweens stretching out so long that he had started giving serious thought to another line of work. For most crewmen, that wouldn\\u2019t have been such a big deal; griping was practically a job requirement for the enlisted man, and Divers was no exception. But he was also a console cowboy through and through, having spent his entire life immersed in the obscure digital rhythms of every computer system he could get his hands on. Hell, the reason he had joined Starfleet in the first place was to get up close and personal with heavy tech. If that particular thrill was gone then there wasn\\u2019t a hell of a lot left for him, and more than one woman on board lived in fear of where his attentions might turn next.\\n\\nLieutenant Marksen wasn\\u2019t one of them, though. A stint in security meant she knew how to put the hurt on him, so Divers knew better than to mess with her. He barely even acknowledged Marksen as she climbed up a ladder from the lower decks and slid into the chair next to him, his eyes never leaving the bank of virtual screens that hovered over his station.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re early,\\u201d she said, firing up her own set of screens.\\n\\n\\u201cGot tired of the movie they were running in the mess club.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cCouldn\\u2019t tell.

Request identity confirmation.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI do so confirm,\\u201d Divers said.\\n\\n\\u201cThank God for that,\\u201d Marksen said, closing out the entry. \\u201cFor a second there, I thought I might have to shoot you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnything to break up the routine.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNumber three just completed a self-diagnostic,\\u201d Divers told her, his hands a blur as they moved across his console. \\u201cChip alpha-tango-seven-niner in array fourteen reports an impending fail and will need replacing. Oh, and there was a minor interference pattern that briefly triggered a breach mode before the core figured out what was going on and corrected itself.\\u201d\\n\\nMarksen called up the event on her console and studied the figures for a moment.\\n\\n\\u201cWere you able to pinpoint the exact source?\\u201d she asked.\\n\\n\\u201cClose enough to make it an easy call. It\\u2019s probably just a feedback surge coming off the pings from our own substation. Back at tech we used to call it a curly ghost. We\\u2019d see them pop off from time to time.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHmm,\\u201d Marksen mused. She didn\\u2019t really sound concerned\\u2014just bored and like she was looking for any kind of relief. \\u201cWhat was the duration of the breach?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAround 1.2257853 nanoseconds\\u2014or thereabouts.\\u201d He smiled a bit, amused at the mountain she was building out of this molehill. \\u201cIt really was no big deal, lieutenant. We flood the system with maintenance traffic all the time. Some of it just came back on us and got mistaken for an outside incursion, that\\u2019s all.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019d still feel better if one of us checked it out,\\u201d she said, hopping out of her chair. \\u201cI\\u2019ll take a tricorder with me just to make sure it isn\\u2019t something that could turn into a persistent leak. Could be we\\u2019ve got some bad shielding down there.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t worry about it too much,\\u201d Divers pointed out. \\u201cThe kind of surge we\\u2019re talking about doesn\\u2019t pack enough juice to cook popcorn.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen humor me,\\u201d Marksen ordered, heading for the hatch. It opened with a little hiss as the self-contained atmosphere depressurized with the rest of the cabin. \\u201cBesides, it\\u2019s not like we have anything better to do.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSince you\\u2019re going down there anyway, should I alert engineering so that you guys can replace that faulty chip?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMight as well,\\u201d Marksen agreed. \\u201cWhy should we have all the fun?\\u201d\\n\\nAnd with a friendly salute, the lieutenant was on her way. Divers shook his head, but consoled himself knowing that at least the exercise wasn\\u2019t a complete waste of time. He rang up engineering, expecting to hear some tool pusher on the other end. Instead he got Commander La Forge, who apparently had the nasty habit of answering his own calls. Divers gave him a rundown of the situation, which actually intrigued the chief engineer\\u2014although God only knew why. La Forge got so worked up he even volunteered to meet Marksen in SFSA himself. After all, it wasn\\u2019t every day he got to play detective with a curly ghost.\\n\\nClosing out, Divers sank bank into his chair and sighed.\\n\\nOfficers, he lamented. What can you do?\\n\\nBut he had no idea of the chain of events he had just set into motion.\\n\\nThe Ponsak swam in the liquid darkness that enveloped the computer core. In complete isolation, possessing a singularity of purpose, the creature might have felt completely alone in the universe\\u2014supposing that it had the capacity to feel anything. As it was, the Ponsak merely existed as a force without reason: action and reaction, driven by pure instinct, its directives hard-coded in its DNA. It never even occurred to the creature that its appearance might have created an infinitesimal distortion in the subspace field generated by the core, or that such a disturbance could have been detected. It merely proceeded, like a virus attacking its host, aware of nothing that didn\\u2019t immediately stand in its way.\\n\\nThe core itself was mammoth, rising a full two decks from base to apex. The Ponsak circled around the cylindrical face until it found a hard-link access panel, precisely where the starship\\u2019s schematics said it would be. Opening a compartment in its body armor, the Ponsak then retrieved the small device given to it by Captain Quintax. The creature had only a rudimentary understanding of how the Black Box worked, but had memorized every detail of its deployment. As the Ponsak affixed the device to the access panel, a tiny control pad appeared on its face. With a single touch, it engaged\\u2014and began the delicate process of inserting itself through the optical interface, the very gateway into the wider network.\\n\\nThe Ponsak, for its part, waited.\\n\\nA progress indicator ticked away the seconds, rising steadily until it completed the interface. The Ponsak then drilled down through the almost endless layers of information manipulated by the core, finally locating the controls for the ship\\u2019s orbital maneuvering system. Using a preprogrammed routine, it tied the box into those controls. All that remained was to lock everything down with a complex code series\\u2014\\n\\nThe Ponsak stopped, its movements frozen to absolute zero. Senses deviating from its immediate task, the creature expanded its sphere of awareness outward in circles until it detected the source of this new threat.\\n\\nIt waited to see if the human would go past, but calculated the odds as being unlikely. This area of the ship was restricted, and those who entered had a specific reason to be here. True to logic, the human stopped outside the access hatch and dialed in a key code. The hatch then popped open with a soft hiss\\u2014but the sound may as well have been a bullet, for all the potential violence it summoned.\\n\\nRetreating farther into the shadows, the Ponsak made like a hole in the dark.\\n\\nAnd prepared its butcher\\u2019s tools for work.\\n\\nMarksen watched the hatch slide open, light spilling into the core from behind her.\\n\\nHer own shadow fell across the floor, the shape of her body elongating to ghastly proportions as it mirrored her movements\\u2014a disconcerting effect that set her nerves on edge, though she couldn\\u2019t quite fathom why. Marksen had been here dozens of times and never paid it much mind, but all of a sudden she realized how isolated this place was. A person could scream and there wouldn\\u2019t be another soul to hear it\\u2014only the stark, imposing face of the core itself, which neither understood or cared. A person could die down here, and nobody would know it for hours or even days.\\n\\nMarksen chided herself for even thinking it, but still had to suppress a shudder before she could even walk inside. The atmosphere was frigid and dry, like nighttime in the desert, except for the utter sterility of the elements therein. They seemed to draw the life from her as she breathed them in, the core responding with quickening pulses of pseudolight that coursed through its stacks of isolinear chips. The sight of it filled Marksen with a vague dread of being watched, even beckoned, while her instincts pleaded with her to go the other way.\\n\\nGet a hold of yourself.\\n\\nOnly then did Marksen realize that she had been standing by the open doorway, no more than two steps in, steadying herself against the closest bulkhead. The droning of the ship filled her ears, giving her a handle on reality, and Marksen allowed it to clear her head. Reminding herself why she was here, she then reached for the tricorder she had picked up on her way down, peeling it off her belt and feeling the weight of it in her hands. It felt good and solid\\u2014a simple piece of tech, which answered with an affirmative tone as she flipped open the cover.\\n\\nJust get it done, she thought, and started scanning.\\n\\nThe tiny screen bathed her face in a pale green glow, the readings that appeared there strangely comforting. They didn\\u2019t show her much that she didn\\u2019t already know: the strong, proximal curve of a subspace field, modulations of energy states that propagated data along FTL routes\\u2014but all of it was neatly contained, with not a stray impulse to be found. Not a single sign of the \\u201ccurly ghost\\u201d Divers had described.\\n\\nThe voice jolted Marksen so hard she nearly dropped the tricorder. Clutching the device to her chest, she abruptly turned to see Commander La Forge approaching from the outside corridor. He ran to her side and took her by the arm, the concern on his face apparent even behind the VISOR that covered his eyes.\\n\\n\\u201cTake it easy there,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou okay?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d she blurted, still catching her breath. \\u201cSorry about that, commander. I must be a little jumpy today.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI have that affect on people.\\u201d\\n\\nMarksen laughed. Aside from Divers, Geordi La Forge was probably the least threatening man she knew\\u2014a fact only underscored by the warm smile he showed her. \\u201cTalk about weird,\\u201d she said, her fear dissipating to a tingle now that she was no longer alone. \\u201cYou ever walk into a room and just get the creeps?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou are ghost hunting,\\u201d La Forge told her, putting down a tool box that he had brought with him. \\u201cAnd let\\u2019s just say that I\\u2019ve seen a few corners of this ship that would make a great spot for a Halloween party.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cCount me in on the next one.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJust don\\u2019t tell the captain,\\u201d he joked. \\u201cSo did you find anything?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNot a whole a lot,\\u201d Marksen replied, handing him the tricorder. \\u201cShielding looks good, though we might be getting sporadic leaks off that faulty chip.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGood an explanation as any,\\u201d the chief engineer agreed, handing the device back. \\u201cStill, the tricorder can miss readings at the extreme ends of the subspace spectrum.\\u201d He tapped the side of his VISOR. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why I like to eyeball it.\\u201d\\n\\nMarksen smiled, and watched curiously as La Forge did his own scan of the area around the core. Methodically, he turned his gaze from one end to the other, moving in sweeps so that he could take it all in. \\u201cSo far so good,\\u201d he observed. \\u201cWhich array was giving you a problem?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s topside,\\u201d La Forge said, craning to get a look near the ceiling. \\u201cIf that is the source, then it should stand out pretty clear against the conventional EM\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nThe pause was unnatural. It filled the space between them with a mounting silence, building on an exponential curve. Marksen felt a stab of terror, sudden and irresistible\\u2014but not from within. This time it was real, and coming from the direction of La Forge\\u2019s stare.\\n\\nThe engineer frowned. \\u201cWhat the hell is that?\\u201d\\n\\nAnd with blinding speed, the terror fell upon them.\\n\\nLa Forge heard himself shout a warning out to Marksen, right before something savage clawed at him from out of the dark. The impact struck him squarely in the side of the head, reanimating his optic nerves with a bloom of stars and pain as it ripped his VISOR loose. He felt his forehead opening up like a seam, blood pouring into his useless eyes, his hands going up in front of his face in a useless attempt to protect himself. By, then, however, his attacker had moved on to other targets. Two quick jabs to his abdomen made him double over, gasping for breath, before another blow knocked his legs out from under him. La Forge crumpled, crashing into the deck so hard he could hear his bones rattle.\\n\\nThe most amazing force clamped down on the sides of his head. La Forge felt fingers digging into his skull, though it seemed impossible that anyone could be that strong. Fresh pain seeped into his brain like a hot flood, the rest of his body trivial by comparison. Unable to think, he reacted on instinct, tearing at the hands that held him\\u2014but then recoiled against them, so violently that he gagged. The touch was so monstrous, so reptilian, it branded him as unclean even as it squeezed the life out of him.\\n\\noh god oh dear god this thing\\u2019s not alive\\n\\nthis thing holding me touching me is not alive it\\u2019s dead\\n\\nA woman\\u2019s voice: \\u201cDivers! Emergency! We have an intruder\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nThe hands let go, dropping him to the floor.\\n\\nLa Forge heaved, spitting out blood as he rolled onto his side. Conscious thought pierced his mind like a hot lance, matching the agony that his body felt. Why hadn\\u2019t his attacker killed him? It would have been so easy, and La Forge would have welcomed it.\\n\\nThen he heard Marksen screaming, and the reason because crystal.\\n\\nHe groped for the device in a clumsy stupor, fingers dragging across the deck and tearing out his nails. La Forge paid it no heed. The only thing worse than facing the walking dead was facing it in blindness\\u2014and knowing that it had dispensed with him only to go after Marksen. The nightmare of having to sit and listen while that thing did to her what it did to him swelled up in his imagination like a tsunami rolling into shore, because in his mind\\u2019s eye he wouldn\\u2019t be blind at all. Because in his mind\\u2019s eye his imagination would see everything\\u2014\\n\\nThen a slow, gurgling sound. The snapping of wet twigs.\\n\\nLa Forge froze. The silence of the grave descended upon him.\\n\\n\\u201cLieutenant?\\u201d he called, reaching a hand out into the void.\\n\\nA blast of warm, viscous droplets sprayed La Forge in the face. He didn\\u2019t need to see it or taste it to know what it was. The sound of Marksen\\u2019s body, collapsing in a heap next to him, only confirmed that this blood was not his own.\\n\\nBut it would be soon enough. The walking dead would see to that.\\n\\nLa Forge opened up his soul and screamed.\\n\\nSecurity got the call from a frantic crewman. The ship\\u2019s computer routed it to the nearest standby team, where a master chief by the name of Costa answered. He listened closely, trying hard just to make out the crewman\\u2019s name\\u2014Danvers or something like that\\u2014but the voice on the other end was terrified beyond comprehension, babbling so fast that the chief barely understood. He only managed to pick out bits and pieces, fragmented by the sound of a battering ram against a steel door\\u2014until a loud screech burst in, and the voice shouted for the last time.\\n\\nThen the channel cut out. Static and then silence.\\n\\nCosta jumped onto a nearby console, tracing the call to its point of origin. His display highlighted a small area on Deck 31, identifying the section: Subspace Field Systems Access. He tried to raise the crewman again, but nobody answered. That was all Costa needed to know.\\n\\nAlerting the squad on duty, he went over to the armory and punched an access code into the electronic lock. The door slid open as his people arrived, all ten of them filing in one at a time and outfitting themselves with the required equipment: Type II handheld phasers for everyone, with a Type I for use as a backup. Costa did the same, strapping the weapons to his belt and heading out after them\\u2014but then stopped when something else caught his eye.\\n\\nThere, bolted to the wall, was a heavy phaser rifle. The chief thought about it for a moment, remembering the sheer terror he heard in that voice.\\n\\n\\u201cScrew it,\\u201d he said, and grabbed the rifle.\\n\\nAs Costa walked back into the security station, the others noticed the firepower he had slung over his shoulder. They all exchanged the same look, and knew it was bad.\\n\\n\\u201cTime to earn that paycheck,\\u201d the chief said, and led them out to fight.\\n\\nThe Ponsak ran like the devil, no longer concerned with remaining invisible. Anyone it encountered now would be killed\\u2014the equation was as simple as that. Its first priority had been to neutralize the crewman in SFSA. The woman in the core had managed to warn him before the Ponsak disposed of her, creating the very real danger that the core would be taken offline before the Black Box could be fully activated. With SFSA secured, that was no longer a possibility. But there was still the matter of the Box itself, which was not yet ready. With security on the way, the Ponsak had only minutes to complete its mission. After that, it had only to defend its position\\u2014which it would do to the death.\\n\\nIt slipped back into the confines of the core, bypassing the human who still lived. The Ponsak had quickly decided that the human was a minimal threat at this point, and that even the scant few seconds required to finish him off was too much of a delay. Instead, it bounded up the side of the wall like a gigantic insect, once more up toward the ceiling where the Black Box waited. Only a few more keystrokes and its very existence would be complete.\\n\\nAnd it would have all the time in the world to kill.\\n\\nLieutenant Worf routed an Enterprise schematic to the bridge\\u2019s main viewscreen, which showed the engineering core flashing in red. Immediately around it, section dividers also flashed yellow, showing the areas being secured by approaching forces. The Klingon had wasted no time assigning full complements\\u2014not after hearing the distress call. Captain Picard, for his part, hadn\\u2019t argued with him.\\n\\n\\u201cAll security teams reporting in,\\u201d Worf said, reading off his panel. \\u201cDecks 30 through 37 have been evacuated to within five sections of the computer core.\\u201d\\n\\nPicard walked up the ramp that led to the rear of the bridge, joining Worf at the tactical station. The captain watched as moving green dots, which represented each member of the teams, approached the core from both fore and aft on all seven decks. They formed a perimeter around the evacuated sections and then stopped.\\n\\n\\u201cYes. Specialist David Divers, the one who made the call to security\\u2014and Lieutenant Sharon Marksen, who was also on the core duty roster.\\u201d Worf paused for a long moment, and then finally added, \\u201cEngineering reports that Lieutenant Commander La Forge went there ten minutes ago. He is not responding to calls.\\u201d\\n\\nMy God, Picard thought, but kept it to himself. He ran over the scenarios, none of them good. Sensors were useless around the core because the shielding there was too thick, so there was no way to tell if any of them were alive; and even if they were, beaming them out of there was out of the question for the very same reason. Picard shuddered at the thought of what he had to do next\\u2014but as captain, he knew there was no other way to protect the safety of his ship.\\n\\nAt least until we know what the hell is going on.\\n\\n\\u201cEngage the emergency doors,\\u201d he ordered. \\u201cSeal off all sections within the evacuation perimeter. Nobody but the security teams goes in or out.\\u201d\\n\\nCosta read the words stenciled into the bulkhead, the stark, bold lettering that he had seen a hundred times before now conveying the malevolence of the unknown. He signaled for his people to stop, then leveled the sights of his phaser rifle down the short distance that remained between him and SFSA. Tight sweeps on the infra-red detected nothing but empty space, the motion sensor keyed to his spyglass totally still. Even so, the sensor on the back of Costa\\u2019s neck tingled\\u2014and he trusted that a hell of a lot more than any electronic gear. Something was out there, taunting him and daring him to enter.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s right. I can see you but you can\\u2019t see me.\\n\\nHe took a step forward, clinging as close as he could to the wall. Out in front of him, the corridor bent to the left, cutting off his line of sight just short of the hatch that marked his objective.\\n\\nI could be anywhere. Maybe right next to you.\\n\\n\\u201cDammit,\\u201d Costa swore under his breath. He repositioned himself, rifle trained on the kill zone in front of him, but there was no way of seeing without sticking his head out. After that, it was all or nothing.\\n\\nIf you make it that far. If I don\\u2019t take your head off first\\u2026\\n\\nThe chief blinked the sweat from his eyes. Behind him, spaced about two meters apart, the other members of his team took cover behind the archways that led back toward the turbolift. All of them stood at the ready, their bodies like tight coils poised to strike, phasers leveled to give maximum protection to the man walking point. Costa trusted them with his life, and knew they would take down any threat before it could get close to him\\u2014but still, this felt like something else. This felt like something different.\\n\\nThe team stood by, waiting for Costa to make a decision.\\n\\nSteeling his will, the chief thrust himself out in the open. He already had a heavy pull on his rifle\\u2019s trigger, imagining the hell of phaser fire he would unleash on the first thing that twitched\\u2014but when nothing materialized, he gave the rest of the team the signal to go in. Moving in two-by-two formations, they quickly followed Costa\\u2019s lead and closed the last few meters to SFSA. There, they formed a tight cordon, weapons leveled at the entrance.\\n\\nCosta didn\\u2019t even need to look back at his team to know they were ready.\\n\\nOne step at a time, he inched over to the hatch\\u2014or what was left of it. Once a heavy, pressurized door, it had been dented inwards by some incredible force. Costa couldn\\u2019t spot any blast marks, which meant someone had gone in the hard way. He tried not to think about what could cause that kind of damage, though even his rifle now seemed like a piss poor defense against whatever it was. More than that, it would be a goddamn miracle if they could keep this thing contained.\\n\\nHolding his breath, Costa reached out and gave the door a push.\\n\\nIt swung in, giving some resistance on the other side. He tried again, harder this time, but it still wouldn\\u2019t give way. Motioning to the others, Costa positioned two of them on both sides of the entryway. Then, stepping back with his weapon at the ready, he had one of them give the door a pull. It opened slowly with a long, mournful groan\\u2014a sound like the rusted hinges of a mausoleum, with the smell of death closely behind it.\\n\\nAnd a body spilled out into the corridor.\\n\\nCosta jumped back, as the corpse\\u2019s arm flopped down near his boots. It was the only part that still looked remotely human. The rest looked like it had gone through a shredder, the remains of its uniform sliced to ribbons along with the flesh beneath. What remained of the face was even less recognizable, having been pried off and leaving behind a mostly empty skull\\u2014as if some savage hand had simply reached in and scooped it out. Worse that that, however, was the utter lack of blood. All of the wounds had been neatly cauterized, adding an insane sterility to the unspeakable violence.\\n\\nStepping over the body, the chief jammed the business end of his rifle into the confined space beyond the door. In less than two seconds, he confirmed that SFSA was secure. Whatever had carved up the poor bastard had moved on. He then went back and plucked the comm badge off the dead man\\u2019s chest, reading the name embossed on the device.\\n\\n\\u201cDivers,\\u201d Costa said. \\u201cMust be the guy who phoned it in.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGot us a bad one,\\u201d someone else added. \\u201cWhat is this thing, chief?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m more worried about where it is.\\u201d Costa tried sensors again, picking up signatures on every member of his team, but beyond that only noise. Giving up on that line, he tuned his own senses to the air: electricity infused with fear, the kind of thing that made his hairs stand on end. It was still around\\u2014of that he was certain.\\n\\nCosta also knew he had to draw it out.\\n\\nUnless I draw you out first.\\n\\nAnd then, from a short distance away, something else.\\n\\nEveryone tensed. Everyone heard it\\u2014but the words had been so weak, so ephemeral, that belief came hard. Only dead silence could coax that sound back from the deep, and when they heard it again there was no room for doubt.\\n\\nCosta shot a glance down the corridor, in the direction of that plea. There was only one possible place from which it could have come.\\n\\n\\u201cThe core,\\u201d he told the others, and ran toward it.\\n\\nAlert lights flashed above the entrance to the computer core, conspiring with the darkness inside to create a hellish red glow. Costa detected the smell of charred flesh as the team approached, a smoky haze still hanging heavy over the entirety of the section. Costa went in first, crouching in a defensive position while the others poured in behind him. And there, as his eyes adjusted to the gloom, he took in the full scale of what had happened.\\n\\nThe core was a veritable chamber of horrors.\\n\\nUnlike the comparatively clean kill back in SFSA, this place had been rendered in an orgy of blood. Spatter was everywhere, forming helter-skelter patterns on the walls and chip arrays, more blood than seemed possible in a dozen human bodies. Costa swallowed his own gag reflex, trying to stay sharp as he swept the much larger space for signs of movement. He stopped suddenly on one area of the bulkhead, thinking he saw the outline of a person\\u2014until he realized with sickening clarity that the shape had been blasted there in an outline of gore and loose tissue. Beneath that, he found the source: two more corpses, laying in a viscous, spreading pool that appeared more black than red.\\n\\nExcept that one of them stirred.\\n\\nThe chief moved in. He checked the body that didn\\u2019t move\\u2014a woman laying face down on the deck\\u2014and quickly determined that she was dead. He then went to the other one\\u2014a man with an engineering insignia, the pins on his collar indicating a rank of lieutenant commander. Only when Costa turned him over did he see the milky white of the man\\u2019s eyes, his features bruised but unmistakable.\\n\\n\\u201cCommander La Forge,\\u201d Costa told him. \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay. We\\u2019ve got you.\\u201d\\n\\nLa Forge\\u2019s useless eyes fluttered, his head lolling back and forth.\\n\\n\\u201cNo, no, no,\\u201d the chief engineer babbled, half delirious. \\u201cNo, it can\\u2019t be. This can\\u2019t be happening. Lieutenant Marksen\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re here to help,\\u201d Costa said, trying to calm him down. \\u201cBut we need to get you out of here first.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd Costa had to know.\\n\\nLa Forge slumped back, and spoke in a voice that was not his own.\\n\\nThe chief felt La Forge\\u2019s shock drain into him. From there it filled the entire core, like tentacles wrapping around each member of his team, the living only one heartbeat removed from the dead. Somehow, one of them found the commander\\u2019s VISOR and handed it to Costa. Turning the thing over in his hands, Costa could only imagine the horrors it had drilled into La Forge\\u2019s brain before coming off.\\n\\nBut La Forge wanted it back. He reached for it, knowing it was there.\\n\\nCosta gave the VISOR to him. La Forge snapped it into place, and a moment rose to his own two feet. He refused help, instead steadying himself against the bulkhead until he regained some of his strength. No longer blind, no longer tentative, he then straightened himself out and took in everything around him.\\n\\nThe security team, watching him in trepidation.\\n\\nThe woman\\u2019s body, still in death but by no means peaceful.\\n\\nAnd finally himself, his uniform soaked in blood.\\n\\nBut none of that could compare. Not to the realization of horror that dawned across La Forge\\u2019s face, manifesting itself in a slow, deliberate turn toward the doorway. Costa followed that gaze, as did the others, to find them all trapped\\u2014blocked by a figure more shadow than substance, but unquestionably real in its intentions. It appeared humanoid, but Costa knew better.

If you\\u2019ve ever wondered what Star Trek would be like as a modern, Tom Clancy-esque techno-thriller, you\\u2019ve come to the right place. Just in case you\\u2019ve missed the previous installments, you can find them here:\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, if you like this book and want to see it in print, ping Simon & Schuster and Pocket Books on social media and let them know!\\n\\nThe small patch of real estate carved out of the south side of the metroplex had been set aside by the Bezzeret as the Federation\\u2019s operational zone (called OZ on the official maps), but to the small community of scientists and support personnel who lived there it was known as Skid Row\\u2014a modest collection of modular buildings, each one indistinguishable from the others, deposited there by the Starfleet Corps of Engineers when they cobbled the facilities together eight years ago. In that time they had not aged well, taking on the characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood\\u2014a rather seedy part of town as those things went in this day and age, populated by the lower-caste types that always seemed to exist at the fringes of an industrial society, doing the menial jobs that the upper caste would just as soon forget. Flanked by distribution hubs and warehouses, the place didn\\u2019t have much going for it\\u2014just a few shops that sold cheap knock-off goods to offworlders and a dive bar that passed itself off as an exotic cabaret; but the Bezzeret allowed the Federation to conduct itself there more or less autonomously, and the locals\\u2014grateful for the influx of business\\u2014rarely made trouble for their guests.\\n\\nWill Riker sensed it even before he materialized inside the zone, like a heat wave of raw emotion spilling over the border that marked the edge of friendly territory. So did Bev Crusher, who tensed the moment she came out of the matter stream, both of them taking in their surroundings to pinpoint the source. It wasn\\u2019t hard to find. An angry native crowd, milling about outside the compound, bristled at the sight of them\\u2014two more invaders to complement the dozens of others who had beamed down ahead of them as part of the advance team.\\n\\n\\u201cWarm welcome,\\u201d Bev Crusher remarked, having dropped in next to him. \\u201cThink they\\u2019ll ask us to stay for dinner?\\u201d\\n\\nRiker looked the crowd over, searching for signs of real danger. The gathering was hardly what he would have called a riot, but he could see the hate in their eyes nonetheless.\\n\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t plan on being here that long,\\u201d he replied. \\u201cCome on.\\u201d\\n\\nThe two of them made their way through a flurry of activity, toward the center of the compound where most of the action was taking place. Uniformed crewmen from Enterprise pitched in with the resident civilian researchers, taking down what was left of the complex. They loaded everything they could into the large transport containers that Riker had sent down, battering most of the equipment in their haste\\u2014not that the commander took issue. His orders on the matter had been very clear: Get in, get out, do it fast. All other considerations secondary. The only exception were the Level 5 biologicals, which Beverly was here to handle. Bad as things were, an accident involving some nasty pathogen would only make things worse\\u2014and the captain had been quite specific about not making things worse.\\n\\nHe and Beverly turned in the direction of a harried but booming voice, belonging to what could have been the fattest man Riker had ever seen. He bounded toward them faster than what should have been possible, so epic in girth that it seemed he couldn\\u2019t be human; but as he finally arrived, the man revealed himself to be just that\\u2014genteel and with a good humor that made Riker take an instant liking to him.\\n\\n\\u201cWelcome to Skid Row,\\u201d the man huffed, his face beet red but managing to squeeze out a smile between rivulets of sweat. \\u201cOr at least what\\u2019s left of it. Your people came ready to party, I\\u2019ll hand you that.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe aim to please,\\u201d Riker said, shaking his hand. \\u201cAre you Dr. Morton?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cResident xenosociologist,\\u201d Morton replied, \\u201cwhich is a fancy way of saying I don\\u2019t work for a living. Please call me Alex.\\u201d He then turned to Beverly. \\u201cNow I know what you\\u2019re thinking, Dr. Crusher\\u2014so before you whip out that tricorder, I\\u2019ll have you know that I\\u2019ve actually lost over twenty kilos since getting marooned on this rock. Check my file if you don\\u2019t believe me.\\u201d\\n\\nBeverly laughed. \\u201cThe food here must be terrible.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOne of the many things I won\\u2019t miss,\\u201d he affirmed, motioning toward their growing audience outside the compound. \\u201cYou get a chance to meet the neighbors? They\\u2019ve been a bit frisky as of late.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey\\u2019re mostly good people,\\u201d Morton continued, \\u201cbut with a few professional agitators thrown in the mix. The government likes to keep things stirred up, if you know what I mean. Makes it easier to blame outsiders for all their problems.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSo we\\u2019ve seen,\\u201d Beverly said, zipping up her jacket to ward off the early morning desert chill\\u2014but not before Morton noticed the Type II phaser holstered underneath. He didn\\u2019t appear surprised, just mildly amused.\\n\\n\\u201cSure your last name ain\\u2019t Holliday?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYou ought to see the rest of her kit,\\u201d Riker said drily. \\u201cAre any of your people armed?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAgainst the law,\\u201d Morton replied, \\u201ceven for citizens. The government also likes to keep everyone on a short leash.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cStill, it might be a good idea,\\u201d Riker decided. \\u201cI\\u2019d feel a lot better knowing we had an edge, especially if things get out of hand.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe local constabulary might take issue with that.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cFrag \\u2018em. The Bezzeret don\\u2019t get to make all the rules.\\u201d\\n\\nMorton grinned. \\u201cGlad to have you on our side, commander.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cLikewise\\u2014\\u201d Riker began, but got cut off by a piercing shriek that stabbed across the grounds. He reacted instantly, turning in the direction of the sound\\u2014knowing on an instinctive level that it wasn\\u2019t human, but recognizing the rage contained within just the same. Beverly did the same, hand dropping to her weapon as she looked back toward the entrance of the compound, where they saw a throng of Bezzeret protestors now pouring through. Riker had no idea what set them off, but at least as many Federation personnel surged in to meet them. With the two waves fast converging, God only knew what would happen when they hit.\\n\\n\\u201cDammit,\\u201d Riker seethed, heading straight into the fracas with Beverly on his six. Morton did his best to keep up, but quickly fell behind in the swell of bodies as the two officers pushed their way through. \\u201cMake a hole!\\u201d Riker shouted, barely able to hear himself over the crowd, which only grew louder and more rambunctious the deeper he went. By now, everyone was itching for a fight\\u2014himself included, even though he didn\\u2019t quite know why.\\n\\nThen he reached the center of the storm, and saw for himself.\\n\\nThere, in the no man\\u2019s land between the two opposing factions, one of Morton\\u2019s people \\u2014a woman, no less\\u2014faced off against a Bezzeret. The two circled each other, already dusted up and bloodied from more than a few traded blows. Morton\\u2019s girl held her own, though, getting some jabs in as her much taller opponent swung at her.\\n\\n\\u201cCome on, you stringy bastard,\\u201d she taunted. \\u201cThat the best you got?\\u201d\\n\\nThe Bezzeret bared his teeth, emitting a low growl\\u2014the same bestial tone Riker had heard before. The sound of it made his blood run cold, almost as much as the dull glow behind the Bezzeret\\u2019s eyes.\\n\\nAnd Riker knew: He\\u2019ll kill her if he gets the chance.\\n\\nThe woman, agile as she was, didn\\u2019t fully realize the danger. Dropping her guard only for a second, she gave the Bezzeret the opening he needed. He lunged, moving unbelievably fast, fingers hooked into claws and reaching for her neck. Somehow the woman saw it coming, and pivoted her body to the left to avoid what would have been a fatal strike. But her shoulder took the brunt instead, the impact spinning her around and stuffing her face-first into the ground. She pushed herself up, scrambling to get clear, but the Bezzeret grabbed her by the sides of the head\\u2014his powerful hands squeezing her skull, determined to crush it.\\n\\nBoth men went flying, a tangle of limbs thrashing against one another. Riker held the advantage, though, rolling away and jumping up before the dazed Bezzeret knew what was happening. He then crouched, ready to go on offense again as the Bezzeret clambered back to his feet. This time the alien hissed, an altogether demonic sound, and Riker saw the hell fire behind those eyes directed at him. Clearly, this wasn\\u2019t going to end until one of them was dead\\u2014and the crowd, now worked to an absolute frenzy, expected nothing less.\\n\\nUntil the scream of a phaser silenced them.\\n\\nThe beam struck the Bezzeret squarely in the chest, so hard that it knocked him back several meters. He crumpled to the ground a twitching mass, his body racked by stray electrical impulses, though his moans left no doubt that he was still alive. The phaser had only been set to stun\\u2014but jacked to a high enough level to hurt. Riker had to admire the shooter\\u2019s style.\\n\\nThe crowd parting, he saw Beverly level her weapon at the other protesters.\\n\\nSomething in her tone made the Bezzeret take heed. They retreated a few steps, helping their comrade up, but then regained enough courage to stand their ground. That was when Morton arrived, even more winded than before, and sized up the situation in that canny way of his. Kneeling down to assist the woman from his team, he looked up at Beverly and then towards Riker.\\n\\n\\u201cIs this what you meant by out of hand?\\u201d he asked.\\n\\nThe Bezzeret also waited on Riker\\u2019s answer. He could tell that they were on the edge, and that the slightest push could nudge them either way. He thought about drawing his own phaser, matching Beverly\\u2019s show of force, but instinct made him reconsider. This was a brawl, not a battle\\u2014and he had already seized the initiative with his fists.\\n\\n\\u201cI will have order!\\u201d he shouted, in a voice that would have made his drill instructor at the Academy proud. \\u201cYou people will disperse immediately so we can finish our work. Anybody who interferes,\\u201d he trailed off, leveling an acid scowl at the stunned Bezzeret. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve already seen what happens.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Bezzeret chattered amongst themselves, still uncertain.\\n\\n\\u201cMake it hard on us,\\u201d Riker prodded, \\u201cwe\\u2019ll make it even harder on you.\\u201d\\n\\nThey exchanged a few glances, searching for a leader. None arose.\\n\\n\\u201cSo what\\u2019s it going to be?\\u201d\\n\\nThe heat that fed the Bezzeret frenzy settled into a slow burn. Gradually, they began to disperse\\u2014including the one Beverly shot, who hobbled away with the aid of his friends, his pride wounded more than anything else. He spat at Riker\\u2019s feet as he went past, muttering something in his native language that cast a ripple of assent among the others.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\\u201d Riker asked.\\n\\n\\u201cHumans go home,\\u201d Morton translated, dusting off his knees as he and Beverly came over. They watched the Bezzeret retreat, which extended back to the compound\\u2019s perimeter, but went no farther. There they remained, like a storm hanging just off shore, replenishing their fury for next time. \\u201cIf it\\u2019s all the same to you, I\\u2019d like like to grant their wish. The best view of this place will be in the rear view mirror\\u2014preferably with a beer in hand.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI heard that,\\u201d Riker agreed, and started to walk with Beverly and Morton toward the operations shack. Enterprise had already started beaming cargo up, the large carriers dematerializing in the courtyard as they went by. \\u201cWe got the manifest for all your gear, but I\\u2019m thinking we ought to prioritize. As long as we get the vital stuff first, we can leave the rest of it behind if things deteriorate any more than they already have.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey can bill me,\\u201d the commander retorted, turning to Beverly. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s our time frame for securing the biologicals?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThree hours,\\u201d she answered. \\u201cTwo if we really push it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTwo hours,\\u201d Riker grumbled. \\u201cNot even enough time for a poker game.\\u201d It was, however, a lot more time than he wanted to spend here, with all those Bezzeret eyes watching. And the protestors outside the grounds were only the beginning. There might well be even more of them, staring down from the ramshackle buildings of Skid Row, waiting for some signal to attack. Plenty of places to hide in there, Riker thought, feeling more vulnerable than ever before. If it came down to actually defending this place, he had no idea how the hell to do it.\\n\\n\\u201cMove like you got a purpose,\\u201d he ordered.\\n\\nThe volume of computer activity that takes place on board starship is considerable. In fact, the burden placed on its computer cores are of such magnitude and importance that the use of conventional processing elements is impossible\\u2014they are simply too slow. To answer these demands, a network which makes use of optical transtator clusters made up of thousands of faster than light nanoprocessor units was developed to become the \\u201cnervous system\\u201d of a starship. In essence, the same theory which made warp drive a working reality was applied to generating a subspace field within this network, thus allowing the ship\\u2019s computer to process information at faster than light speeds. Not only did this arrangement free the designers from the confines of real space processing, it also saved a lot of headaches by eliminating the need to support the almost absolute-zero temperatures required by conventional superconductors.\\n\\nThe principle was efficient, stable and had been in use for nearly 200 years. From an engineering standpoint, there was virtually no downside\\u2014except for one possibility that nearly everyone had overlooked.\\n\\nWhen the subject of catastrophic failure came up at the original project meetings, only one scientist\\u2014a multidimensional physicist named David Zeen\\u2014pointed out that there indeed was an Achilles Heel hidden within the system. A theoretician with an obsessive-compulsive streak, Zeen worried about everything\\u2014including the possibility that a subspace pulse of a certain magnitude could wreak havoc with the isolinear processors that were central to the core\\u2019s design. If the pulse were especially strong, it could effectively wipe them clean, like an eraser being dragged across a chalkboard.\\n\\nBy this time, of course, a great deal of time and money had already been spent on the original design. Implementing safeguards against the kind of event Zeen postulated would have set the project back by several months, if not a year or more. Further undermining his argument was the simple fact that freak subspace pulses were almost unheard of in nature, outside of a supernova or the event horizon of a black hole\\u2014and if a starship ever got close enough to one of those, a computer failure would be the least of its problems. Accordingly, in true bureaucratic fashion, Zeen\\u2019s opinion was carefully noted and summarily discarded. Work proceeded on schedule and everyone went their separate ways.\\n\\nExcept that somewhere along the line, word trickled back to Starfleet Tactical. The rocket boys there had already been working on ways to screw with an enemy vessel\\u2019s warp drive by subjecting it to intense subspace fields, an effort that had yielded mixed results at best. The revelation that they could apply the same techniques more effectively to screwing with an enemy vessel\\u2019s computer\\u2014well, that seemed like the next best thing. And seeing as the department had already budgeted for the research, they didn\\u2019t need to go to the Federation for additional funding. Not only was this cost-conscious, it also allowed the admiral in charge to keep any new weapons that resulted off the books.\\n\\nSo began the development of what would become the Localized Conductive Subspace Interference Generator\\u2014LoConSIG for short, a rather clunky acronym that no one would ever use. In more vicious circles (and there were many), it was known as the Starship Killer. Euphemistically, it was called the Black Box\\u2014an overtly descriptive name, but like Pandora\\u2019s Box, one that gave no clue as to the deadly contents inside.\\n\\nIt is not a bomb, though it could be categorized as a weapon of mass destruction. A small, rectangular object, it measures 50cm by 30cm with no visible controls aside from a small programming pad on the topmost surface. The components are divided into two sub-systems: one is capable of rerouting computer systems and executing commands, while the other is a tiny but lethal static subspace field generator capable of delivering a whopping burst of 4500 millocochranes. In real time, the length of this burst is less than one-thousandth of a second\\u2014but it is enough to inflict fatal damage on a faster-than-light computer system.\\n\\nWhat David Zeen had envisioned as his worst nightmare, Tactical had made a working reality. Frightening as it was, though, the Black Box ultimately didn\\u2019t find much of a place for itself among the arsenal of more conventional weapons. Commonplace as they were, phasers and photon torpedoes could be used at a distance\\u2014you simply aimed at fired. Using the Black Box was a bit more complex, because it worked from the inside out. It had to be tied directly to a ship\\u2019s core interface, which meant someone had to beam aboard an enemy vessel to deploy it\\u2014and that, as they say, is easier said than done under combat conditions.\\n\\nWhat the Black Box could do effectively, however, was destroy a ship without leaving a trace of itself. With all of its other limitations, that left the weapon but with one real use: sabotage. Given the state of affairs in the Federation, though, and the Council\\u2019s general reluctance to authorize covert actions, that meant in all likelihood that the Black Box would spend its life gathering dust in some vault\\u2014an interesting proof of concept, but little more.\\n\\nStill, there were those who thought it wasn\\u2019t a bad thing to have around. Terrence Blake was such a man. From the moment he first saw the Black Box, he understood its potential. In fact, he had been so impressed with the device that he arranged to have several of them deployed in the field, each one in the hands of a trusted ally. It was a proactive move on his part\\u2014highly illegal, given the lack of Starfleet sanction, but a wise one nonetheless. Blake hadn\\u2019t risen up the chain of command by being caught unprepared, and the Black Box gave him an edge that nobody else had.\\n\\nBecause you never knew when you would have to destroy a ship in secret.\\n\\nEspecially one of your own.\\n\\nSteven Quintax felt strange, staring down into his empty hands. Only moments before, he had held the Black Box in them, pondering the sheer power and naked potential contained in such an innocuous package. Stranger still, he had handed it off without any hesitation at all\\u2014a transaction, more or less, like contraband between pirates, conducted in the secrecy of his quarters. Only now, left alone with his thoughts, did he begin to realize the magnitude of what he had set into motion.\\n\\nThe admiral would have done the same thing, Quintax kept telling himself. He always made the tough decisions. When he gets wind of this, he\\u2019ll know I did the right thing.\\n\\nSo why did his hands shake so badly?\\n\\nHe balled them into fists, trying to quell his angst, rocking back and forth but finding no peace in repetition. His conscience would simply not allow it\\u2014a conscience that had been notably absent in the presence of the Ponsak, who had taken the box from him and disappeared. Quintax knew where the creature was by now, though he could never fathom how; it was one of those things he chose not to question, for fear of where the answer might lead. He only knew that what he had started could not be stopped.\\n\\nAnd he would most certainly be damned for it.\\n\\nQuintax rocked some more, that thought actually giving him some measure of comfort. Perhaps hell wouldn\\u2019t be such a bad place after all\\u2014and there was a certain solace in knowing that it was his final destination. Still, Quintax couldn\\u2019t shake the image of Blake looking down at him, in pitiful disappointment: Zeus, with his all to familiar contempt for the weakness of mere mortals. Enterprise would make a fine enough burnt offering, wouldn\\u2019t she?\\n\\nQuintax, praying to his jealous god, begged for the strength to see it through.\\n\\n\\u201cThy will be done,\\u201d he whispered. \\u201cThy will be done.\\u201d\\n\\nThere was once a philosopher, not from Earth, who speculated that the nature of evil is not so much that which opposes good, but a void in which good cannot exist. Only within such a space is there room for evil, which itself is a vacuum. That which is nothingness appears from nothingness, and can thus become anything it wants to be\\u2014imparting to evil a remarkable flexibility, because it can assume any form that it wants. Good suffers from pretensions; evil does not. Accordingly, it is easy for evil to slip on past, unnoticed by human eyes, in willful blindness.\\n\\nSo it was from nothingness that the creature appeared\\u2014the same one that would haunt Steven Quintax in the few dreams that he had left, like a nightmare fringe that leaves no trace of itself in the morning, save a tingling, barely palpable sense of fear; the same creature which, because of its nature, was the perfect warrior\\u2014a thing with no name and no face and no identity, only a singularity of purpose. Like a distillation of evil, it held no pretense. And like an incarnation of evil, it walked the vessel\\u2019s corridors at the border between reality and terror, where no eye could see nor any sensor detect.\\n\\nIt heard the voices and felt the heartbeats of those it passed, taking in a brief taste of life with every encounter, watching them with a curiosity that wasn\\u2019t so much alive as it was existent. It brushed by a few of them, some even close enough to touch, perhaps stirring a detached sort of dread easily dismissed as nerves or fatigue, before moving on to its objective. Because nothing would keep it from its objective.\\n\\nThe creature was Ponsak, and this was its duty.\\n\\nThe information systems architecture of a Galaxy-class starship consists of three computer cores, two of which are located on the port and starboard sides of the primary hull, while the third resides deep within the secondary. Each provides load balancing and redundancy for its counterparts, the split arrangement also allowing the two hulls to operate independently of one another during separated flight. Although largely automated, the cores are constantly monitored by specialists posted in an adjoining substation known as Subspace Field System Access\\u2014or SFSA\\u2014which is designated as a vaulted area because of its critical importance to shipboard operations. Aside from the captain and the XO, only those assigned to SFSA are permitted to enter.\\n\\nDuty there isn\\u2019t considered the worst on board, but it comes close. The gray walls, dark lighting, mazes of isolinear chips, and the sparse interfaces don\\u2019t present a warm and welcome sight (someone once observed that the designers had hired the same interior decorator as the Borg). Coupled with the constant, semi-sentient hum radiating from the core chamber, the atmosphere seems to actively loathe any living thing that enters it. This effect is, of course, entirely psychological, but it manifests itself consistently enough so that shifts are rotated out every four hours\\u2014the shortest duration of any on board. Because of this, the rest of the crew tends to view SFSA specialists as a little squirrel y, better at talking to machines than to other human beings. The specialists, for their part, think even less of outsiders in return\\u2014but they know how to keep things running, so they rarely get asked any questions.\\n\\nUnder non-combat conditions, the job of monitoring the cores is the responsibility of a two-person team. The lead position is held by a commissioned officer, typically a lieutenant junior-grade, assisted by a petty officer second-class. Their routine is a simple one, consisting primarily of fine tuning, maintenance and watching a diagnostic feed\\u2014monkey work, as the hardcore systems jockeys liked to call it, but demanded under regulations. The rest of the time, the team functions as a backstop against any possible contingency. That\\u2019s a fancy way of saying they sit around waiting for something to go wrong\\u2014and even then, they\\u2019re a superfluous component at best. If one of the cores goes down, the others kick in automatically to take up the slack; and beyond that, if the unthinkable happened, a system of dedicated subprocessors could take over minimal operations in the event of a multiple core failure. In essence, the emergency would have occurred, been isolated, and addressed before the crew could even hit the alert button.\\n\\nBut protocol was protocol, and if it was anything that Jean-Luc Picard impressed upon his people it was the human factor involved in all phases of ship\\u2019s operations. No matter how well the engineers had designed her, Enterprise was not perfect, and it was up to her crew to remain sharp when the vessel herself couldn\\u2019t. Sure, it was a platitude\\u2014but it was an effective one, and kept people from going going batshit when it seemed like duty consisted solely of staring at a screen of endless figures and waiting for the chimes to ring so you could go up to Ten Forward and be glad that it was someone else\\u2019s turn.\\n\\nSometimes, though, it wore thin. With the skipper acting beyond strange and a general pall of tension hanging over the ship, it was easy to glance up at the clock and think an hour had passed and find that it had only been five minutes. Specialist Divers had seen more than his share of that lately, with the in-betweens stretching out so long that he had started giving serious thought to another line of work. For most crewmen, that wouldn\\u2019t have been such a big deal; griping was practically a job requirement for the enlisted man, and Divers was no exception. But he was also a console cowboy through and through, having spent his entire life immersed in the obscure digital rhythms of every computer system he could get his hands on. Hell, the reason he had joined Starfleet in the first place was to get up close and personal with heavy tech. If that particular thrill was gone then there wasn\\u2019t a hell of a lot left for him, and more than one woman on board lived in fear of where his attentions might turn next.\\n\\nLieutenant Marksen wasn\\u2019t one of them, though. A stint in security meant she knew how to put the hurt on him, so Divers knew better than to mess with her. He barely even acknowledged Marksen as she climbed up a ladder from the lower decks and slid into the chair next to him, his eyes never leaving the bank of virtual screens that hovered over his station.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re early,\\u201d she said, firing up her own set of screens.\\n\\n\\u201cGot tired of the movie they were running in the mess club.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cCouldn\\u2019t tell. They all kind of look the same.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSailor\\u2019s lament,\\u201d she sighed, hitting a button to record for the log. \\u201cMarksen, Karen J. Assuming watch, 1200 hours. Divers, Bryan T. attending. Request identity confirmation.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI do so confirm,\\u201d Divers said.\\n\\n\\u201cThank God for that,\\u201d Marksen said, closing out the entry. \\u201cFor a second there, I thought I might have to shoot you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnything to break up the routine.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNumber three just completed a self-diagnostic,\\u201d Divers told her, his hands a blur as they moved across his console. \\u201cChip alpha-tango-seven-niner in array fourteen reports an impending fail and will need replacing. Oh, and there was a minor interference pattern that briefly triggered a breach mode before the core figured out what was going on and corrected itself.\\u201d\\n\\nMarksen called up the event on her console and studied the figures for a moment.\\n\\n\\u201cWere you able to pinpoint the exact source?\\u201d she asked.\\n\\n\\u201cClose enough to make it an easy call. It\\u2019s probably just a feedback surge coming off the pings from our own substation. Back at tech we used to call it a curly ghost. We\\u2019d see them pop off from time to time.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHmm,\\u201d Marksen mused. She didn\\u2019t really sound concerned\\u2014just bored and like she was looking for any kind of relief. \\u201cWhat was the duration of the breach?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAround 1.2257853 nanoseconds\\u2014or thereabouts.\\u201d He smiled a bit, amused at the mountain she was building out of this molehill. \\u201cIt really was no big deal, lieutenant. We flood the system with maintenance traffic all the time. Some of it just came back on us and got mistaken for an outside incursion, that\\u2019s all.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019d still feel better if one of us checked it out,\\u201d she said, hopping out of her chair. \\u201cI\\u2019ll take a tricorder with me just to make sure it isn\\u2019t something that could turn into a persistent leak. Could be we\\u2019ve got some bad shielding down there.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t worry about it too much,\\u201d Divers pointed out. \\u201cThe kind of surge we\\u2019re talking about doesn\\u2019t pack enough juice to cook popcorn.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen humor me,\\u201d Marksen ordered, heading for the hatch. It opened with a little hiss as the self-contained atmosphere depressurized with the rest of the cabin. \\u201cBesides, it\\u2019s not like we have anything better to do.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSince you\\u2019re going down there anyway, should I alert engineering so that you guys can replace that faulty chip?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cMight as well,\\u201d Marksen agreed. \\u201cWhy should we have all the fun?\\u201d\\n\\nAnd with a friendly salute, the lieutenant was on her way. Divers shook his head, but consoled himself knowing that at least the exercise wasn\\u2019t a complete waste of time. He rang up engineering, expecting to hear some tool pusher on the other end. Instead he got Commander La Forge, who apparently had the nasty habit of answering his own calls. Divers gave him a rundown of the situation, which actually intrigued the chief engineer\\u2014although God only knew why. La Forge got so worked up he even volunteered to meet Marksen in SFSA himself. After all, it wasn\\u2019t every day he got to play detective with a curly ghost.\\n\\nClosing out, Divers sank bank into his chair and sighed.\\n\\nOfficers, he lamented. What can you do?\\n\\nBut he had no idea of the chain of events he had just set into motion.\\n\\nThe Ponsak swam in the liquid darkness that enveloped the computer core. In complete isolation, possessing a singularity of purpose, the creature might have felt completely alone in the universe\\u2014supposing that it had the capacity to feel anything. As it was, the Ponsak merely existed as a force without reason: action and reaction, driven by pure instinct, its directives hard-coded in its DNA. It never even occurred to the creature that its appearance might have created an infinitesimal distortion in the subspace field generated by the core, or that such a disturbance could have been detected. It merely proceeded, like a virus attacking its host, aware of nothing that didn\\u2019t immediately stand in its way.\\n\\nThe core itself was mammoth, rising a full two decks from base to apex. The Ponsak circled around the cylindrical face until it found a hard-link access panel, precisely where the starship\\u2019s schematics said it would be. Opening a compartment in its body armor, the Ponsak then retrieved the small device given to it by Captain Quintax. The creature had only a rudimentary understanding of how the Black Box worked, but had memorized every detail of its deployment. As the Ponsak affixed the device to the access panel, a tiny control pad appeared on its face. With a single touch, it engaged\\u2014and began the delicate process of inserting itself through the optical interface, the very gateway into the wider network.\\n\\nThe Ponsak, for its part, waited.\\n\\nA progress indicator ticked away the seconds, rising steadily until it completed the interface. The Ponsak then drilled down through the almost endless layers of information manipulated by the core, finally locating the controls for the ship\\u2019s orbital maneuvering system. Using a preprogrammed routine, it tied the box into those controls. All that remained was to lock everything down with a complex code series\\u2014\\n\\nThe Ponsak stopped, its movements frozen to absolute zero. Senses deviating from its immediate task, the creature expanded its sphere of awareness outward in circles until it detected the source of this new threat.\\n\\nIt waited to see if the human would go past, but calculated the odds as being unlikely. This area of the ship was restricted, and those who entered had a specific reason to be here. True to logic, the human stopped outside the access hatch and dialed in a key code. The hatch then popped open with a soft hiss\\u2014but the sound may as well have been a bullet, for all the potential violence it summoned.\\n\\nRetreating farther into the shadows, the Ponsak made like a hole in the dark.\\n\\nAnd prepared its butcher\\u2019s tools for work.\\n\\nMarksen watched the hatch slide open, light spilling into the core from behind her.\\n\\nHer own shadow fell across the floor, the shape of her body elongating to ghastly proportions as it mirrored her movements\\u2014a disconcerting effect that set her nerves on edge, though she couldn\\u2019t quite fathom why. Marksen had been here dozens of times and never paid it much mind, but all of a sudden she realized how isolated this place was. A person could scream and there wouldn\\u2019t be another soul to hear it\\u2014only the stark, imposing face of the core itself, which neither understood or cared. A person could die down here, and nobody would know it for hours or even days.\\n\\nMarksen chided herself for even thinking it, but still had to suppress a shudder before she could even walk inside. The atmosphere was frigid and dry, like nighttime in the desert, except for the utter sterility of the elements therein. They seemed to draw the life from her as she breathed them in, the core responding with quickening pulses of pseudolight that coursed through its stacks of isolinear chips. The sight of it filled Marksen with a vague dread of being watched, even beckoned, while her instincts pleaded with her to go the other way.\\n\\nGet a hold of yourself.\\n\\nOnly then did Marksen realize that she had been standing by the open doorway, no more than two steps in, steadying herself against the closest bulkhead. The droning of the ship filled her ears, giving her a handle on reality, and Marksen allowed it to clear her head. Reminding herself why she was here, she then reached for the tricorder she had picked up on her way down, peeling it off her belt and feeling the weight of it in her hands. It felt good and solid\\u2014a simple piece of tech, which answered with an affirmative tone as she flipped open the cover.\\n\\nJust get it done, she thought, and started scanning.\\n\\nThe tiny screen bathed her face in a pale green glow, the readings that appeared there strangely comforting. They didn\\u2019t show her much that she didn\\u2019t already know: the strong, proximal curve of a subspace field, modulations of energy states that propagated data along FTL routes\\u2014but all of it was neatly contained, with not a stray impulse to be found. Not a single sign of the \\u201ccurly ghost\\u201d Divers had described.\\n\\nThe voice jolted Marksen so hard she nearly dropped the tricorder. Clutching the device to her chest, she abruptly turned to see Commander La Forge approaching from the outside corridor. He ran to her side and took her by the arm, the concern on his face apparent even behind the VISOR that covered his eyes.\\n\\n\\u201cTake it easy there,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou okay?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d she blurted, still catching her breath. \\u201cSorry about that, commander. I must be a little jumpy today.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI have that affect on people.\\u201d\\n\\nMarksen laughed. Aside from Divers, Geordi La Forge was probably the least threatening man she knew\\u2014a fact only underscored by the warm smile he showed her. \\u201cTalk about weird,\\u201d she said, her fear dissipating to a tingle now that she was no longer alone. \\u201cYou ever walk into a room and just get the creeps?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou are ghost hunting,\\u201d La Forge told her, putting down a tool box that he had brought with him. \\u201cAnd let\\u2019s just say that I\\u2019ve seen a few corners of this ship that would make a great spot for a Halloween party.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cCount me in on the next one.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJust don\\u2019t tell the captain,\\u201d he joked. \\u201cSo did you find anything?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNot a whole a lot,\\u201d Marksen replied, handing him the tricorder. \\u201cShielding looks good, though we might be getting sporadic leaks off that faulty chip.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGood an explanation as any,\\u201d the chief engineer agreed, handing the device back. \\u201cStill, the tricorder can miss readings at the extreme ends of the subspace spectrum.\\u201d He tapped the side of his VISOR. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why I like to eyeball it.\\u201d\\n\\nMarksen smiled, and watched curiously as La Forge did his own scan of the area around the core. Methodically, he turned his gaze from one end to the other, moving in sweeps so that he could take it all in. \\u201cSo far so good,\\u201d he observed. \\u201cWhich array was giving you a problem?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s topside,\\u201d La Forge said, craning to get a look near the ceiling. \\u201cIf that is the source, then it should stand out pretty clear against the conventional EM\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nThe pause was unnatural. It filled the space between them with a mounting silence, building on an exponential curve. Marksen felt a stab of terror, sudden and irresistible\\u2014but not from within. This time it was real, and coming from the direction of La Forge\\u2019s stare.\\n\\nThe engineer frowned. \\u201cWhat the hell is that?\\u201d\\n\\nAnd with blinding speed, the terror fell upon them.\\n\\nLa Forge heard himself shout a warning out to Marksen, right before something savage clawed at him from out of the dark. The impact struck him squarely in the side of the head, reanimating his optic nerves with a bloom of stars and pain as it ripped his VISOR loose. He felt his forehead opening up like a seam, blood pouring into his useless eyes, his hands going up in front of his face in a useless attempt to protect himself. By, then, however, his attacker had moved on to other targets. Two quick jabs to his abdomen made him double over, gasping for breath, before another blow knocked his legs out from under him. La Forge crumpled, crashing into the deck so hard he could hear his bones rattle.\\n\\nThe most amazing force clamped down on the sides of his head. La Forge felt fingers digging into his skull, though it seemed impossible that anyone could be that strong. Fresh pain seeped into his brain like a hot flood, the rest of his body trivial by comparison. Unable to think, he reacted on instinct, tearing at the hands that held him\\u2014but then recoiled against them, so violently that he gagged. The touch was so monstrous, so reptilian, it branded him as unclean even as it squeezed the life out of him.\\n\\noh god oh dear god this thing\\u2019s not alive\\n\\nthis thing holding me touching me is not alive it\\u2019s dead\\n\\nA woman\\u2019s voice: \\u201cDivers! Emergency! We have an intruder\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nThe hands let go, dropping him to the floor.\\n\\nLa Forge heaved, spitting out blood as he rolled onto his side. Conscious thought pierced his mind like a hot lance, matching the agony that his body felt. Why hadn\\u2019t his attacker killed him? It would have been so easy, and La Forge would have welcomed it.\\n\\nThen he heard Marksen screaming, and the reason because crystal.\\n\\nHe groped for the device in a clumsy stupor, fingers dragging across the deck and tearing out his nails. La Forge paid it no heed. The only thing worse than facing the walking dead was facing it in blindness\\u2014and knowing that it had dispensed with him only to go after Marksen. The nightmare of having to sit and listen while that thing did to her what it did to him swelled up in his imagination like a tsunami rolling into shore, because in his mind\\u2019s eye he wouldn\\u2019t be blind at all. Because in his mind\\u2019s eye his imagination would see everything\\u2014\\n\\nThen a slow, gurgling sound. The snapping of wet twigs.\\n\\nLa Forge froze. The silence of the grave descended upon him.\\n\\n\\u201cLieutenant?\\u201d he called, reaching a hand out into the void.\\n\\nA blast of warm, viscous droplets sprayed La Forge in the face. He didn\\u2019t need to see it or taste it to know what it was. The sound of Marksen\\u2019s body, collapsing in a heap next to him, only confirmed that this blood was not his own.\\n\\nBut it would be soon enough. The walking dead would see to that.\\n\\nLa Forge opened up his soul and screamed.\\n\\nSecurity got the call from a frantic crewman. The ship\\u2019s computer routed it to the nearest standby team, where a master chief by the name of Costa answered. He listened closely, trying hard just to make out the crewman\\u2019s name\\u2014Danvers or something like that\\u2014but the voice on the other end was terrified beyond comprehension, babbling so fast that the chief barely understood. He only managed to pick out bits and pieces, fragmented by the sound of a battering ram against a steel door\\u2014until a loud screech burst in, and the voice shouted for the last time.\\n\\nThen the channel cut out. Static and then silence.\\n\\nCosta jumped onto a nearby console, tracing the call to its point of origin. His display highlighted a small area on Deck 31, identifying the section: Subspace Field Systems Access. He tried to raise the crewman again, but nobody answered. That was all Costa needed to know.\\n\\nAlerting the squad on duty, he went over to the armory and punched an access code into the electronic lock. The door slid open as his people arrived, all ten of them filing in one at a time and outfitting themselves with the required equipment: Type II handheld phasers for everyone, with a Type I for use as a backup. Costa did the same, strapping the weapons to his belt and heading out after them\\u2014but then stopped when something else caught his eye.\\n\\nThere, bolted to the wall, was a heavy phaser rifle. The chief thought about it for a moment, remembering the sheer terror he heard in that voice.\\n\\n\\u201cScrew it,\\u201d he said, and grabbed the rifle.\\n\\nAs Costa walked back into the security station, the others noticed the firepower he had slung over his shoulder. They all exchanged the same look, and knew it was bad.\\n\\n\\u201cTime to earn that paycheck,\\u201d the chief said, and led them out to fight.\\n\\nThe Ponsak ran like the devil, no longer concerned with remaining invisible. Anyone it encountered now would be killed\\u2014the equation was as simple as that. Its first priority had been to neutralize the crewman in SFSA. The woman in the core had managed to warn him before the Ponsak disposed of her, creating the very real danger that the core would be taken offline before the Black Box could be fully activated. With SFSA secured, that was no longer a possibility. But there was still the matter of the Box itself, which was not yet ready. With security on the way, the Ponsak had only minutes to complete its mission. After that, it had only to defend its position\\u2014which it would do to the death.\\n\\nIt slipped back into the confines of the core, bypassing the human who still lived. The Ponsak had quickly decided that the human was a minimal threat at this point, and that even the scant few seconds required to finish him off was too much of a delay. Instead, it bounded up the side of the wall like a gigantic insect, once more up toward the ceiling where the Black Box waited. Only a few more keystrokes and its very existence would be complete.\\n\\nAnd it would have all the time in the world to kill.\\n\\nLieutenant Worf routed an Enterprise schematic to the bridge\\u2019s main viewscreen, which showed the engineering core flashing in red. Immediately around it, section dividers also flashed yellow, showing the areas being secured by approaching forces. The Klingon had wasted no time assigning full complements\\u2014not after hearing the distress call. Captain Picard, for his part, hadn\\u2019t argued with him.\\n\\n\\u201cAll security teams reporting in,\\u201d Worf said, reading off his panel. \\u201cDecks 30 through 37 have been evacuated to within five sections of the computer core.\\u201d\\n\\nPicard walked up the ramp that led to the rear of the bridge, joining Worf at the tactical station. The captain watched as moving green dots, which represented each member of the teams, approached the core from both fore and aft on all seven decks. They formed a perimeter around the evacuated sections and then stopped.\\n\\n\\u201cYes. Specialist David Divers, the one who made the call to security\\u2014and Lieutenant Sharon Marksen, who was also on the core duty roster.\\u201d Worf paused for a long moment, and then finally added, \\u201cEngineering reports that Lieutenant Commander La Forge went there ten minutes ago. He is not responding to calls.\\u201d\\n\\nMy God, Picard thought, but kept it to himself. He ran over the scenarios, none of them good. Sensors were useless around the core because the shielding there was too thick, so there was no way to tell if any of them were alive; and even if they were, beaming them out of there was out of the question for the very same reason. Picard shuddered at the thought of what he had to do next\\u2014but as captain, he knew there was no other way to protect the safety of his ship.\\n\\nAt least until we know what the hell is going on.\\n\\n\\u201cEngage the emergency doors,\\u201d he ordered. \\u201cSeal off all sections within the evacuation perimeter. Nobody but the security teams goes in or out.\\u201d\\n\\nCosta read the words stenciled into the bulkhead, the stark, bold lettering that he had seen a hundred times before now conveying the malevolence of the unknown. He signaled for his people to stop, then leveled the sights of his phaser rifle down the short distance that remained between him and SFSA. Tight sweeps on the infra-red detected nothing but empty space, the motion sensor keyed to his spyglass totally still. Even so, the sensor on the back of Costa\\u2019s neck tingled\\u2014and he trusted that a hell of a lot more than any electronic gear. Something was out there, taunting him and daring him to enter.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s right. I can see you but you can\\u2019t see me.\\n\\nHe took a step forward, clinging as close as he could to the wall. Out in front of him, the corridor bent to the left, cutting off his line of sight just short of the hatch that marked his objective.\\n\\nI could be anywhere. Maybe right next to you.\\n\\n\\u201cDammit,\\u201d Costa swore under his breath. He repositioned himself, rifle trained on the kill zone in front of him, but there was no way of seeing without sticking his head out. After that, it was all or nothing.\\n\\nIf you make it that far. If I don\\u2019t take your head off first\\u2026\\n\\nThe chief blinked the sweat from his eyes. Behind him, spaced about two meters apart, the other members of his team took cover behind the archways that led back toward the turbolift. All of them stood at the ready, their bodies like tight coils poised to strike, phasers leveled to give maximum protection to the man walking point. Costa trusted them with his life, and knew they would take down any threat before it could get close to him\\u2014but still, this felt like something else. This felt like something different.\\n\\nThe team stood by, waiting for Costa to make a decision.\\n\\nSteeling his will, the chief thrust himself out in the open. He already had a heavy pull on his rifle\\u2019s trigger, imagining the hell of phaser fire he would unleash on the first thing that twitched\\u2014but when nothing materialized, he gave the rest of the team the signal to go in. Moving in two-by-two formations, they quickly followed Costa\\u2019s lead and closed the last few meters to SFSA. There, they formed a tight cordon, weapons leveled at the entrance.\\n\\nCosta didn\\u2019t even need to look back at his team to know they were ready.\\n\\nOne step at a time, he inched over to the hatch\\u2014or what was left of it. Once a heavy, pressurized door, it had been dented inwards by some incredible force. Costa couldn\\u2019t spot any blast marks, which meant someone had gone in the hard way. He tried not to think about what could cause that kind of damage, though even his rifle now seemed like a piss poor defense against whatever it was. More than that, it would be a goddamn miracle if they could keep this thing contained.\\n\\nHolding his breath, Costa reached out and gave the door a push.\\n\\nIt swung in, giving some resistance on the other side. He tried again, harder this time, but it still wouldn\\u2019t give way. Motioning to the others, Costa positioned two of them on both sides of the entryway. Then, stepping back with his weapon at the ready, he had one of them give the door a pull. It opened slowly with a long, mournful groan\\u2014a sound like the rusted hinges of a mausoleum, with the smell of death closely behind it.\\n\\nAnd a body spilled out into the corridor.\\n\\nCosta jumped back, as the corpse\\u2019s arm flopped down near his boots. It was the only part that still looked remotely human. The rest looked like it had gone through a shredder, the remains of its uniform sliced to ribbons along with the flesh beneath. What remained of the face was even less recognizable, having been pried off and leaving behind a mostly empty skull\\u2014as if some savage hand had simply reached in and scooped it out. Worse that that, however, was the utter lack of blood. All of the wounds had been neatly cauterized, adding an insane sterility to the unspeakable violence.\\n\\nStepping over the body, the chief jammed the business end of his rifle into the confined space beyond the door. In less than two seconds, he confirmed that SFSA was secure. Whatever had carved up the poor bastard had moved on. He then went back and plucked the comm badge off the dead man\\u2019s chest, reading the name embossed on the device.\\n\\n\\u201cDivers,\\u201d Costa said. \\u201cMust be the guy who phoned it in.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGot us a bad one,\\u201d someone else added. \\u201cWhat is this thing, chief?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m more worried about where it is.\\u201d Costa tried sensors again, picking up signatures on every member of his team, but beyond that only noise. Giving up on that line, he tuned his own senses to the air: electricity infused with fear, the kind of thing that made his hairs stand on end. It was still around\\u2014of that he was certain.\\n\\nCosta also knew he had to draw it out.\\n\\nUnless I draw you out first.\\n\\nAnd then, from a short distance away, something else.\\n\\nEveryone tensed. Everyone heard it\\u2014but the words had been so weak, so ephemeral, that belief came hard. Only dead silence could coax that sound back from the deep, and when they heard it again there was no room for doubt.\\n\\nCosta shot a glance down the corridor, in the direction of that plea. There was only one possible place from which it could have come.\\n\\n\\u201cThe core,\\u201d he told the others, and ran toward it.\\n\\nAlert lights flashed above the entrance to the computer core, conspiring with the darkness inside to create a hellish red glow. Costa detected the smell of charred flesh as the team approached, a smoky haze still hanging heavy over the entirety of the section. Costa went in first, crouching in a defensive position while the others poured in behind him. And there, as his eyes adjusted to the gloom, he took in the full scale of what had happened.\\n\\nThe core was a veritable chamber of horrors.\\n\\nUnlike the comparatively clean kill back in SFSA, this place had been rendered in an orgy of blood. Spatter was everywhere, forming helter-skelter patterns on the walls and chip arrays, more blood than seemed possible in a dozen human bodies. Costa swallowed his own gag reflex, trying to stay sharp as he swept the much larger space for signs of movement. He stopped suddenly on one area of the bulkhead, thinking he saw the outline of a person\\u2014until he realized with sickening clarity that the shape had been blasted there in an outline of gore and loose tissue. Beneath that, he found the source: two more corpses, laying in a viscous, spreading pool that appeared more black than red.\\n\\nExcept that one of them stirred.\\n\\nThe chief moved in. He checked the body that didn\\u2019t move\\u2014a woman laying face down on the deck\\u2014and quickly determined that she was dead. He then went to the other one\\u2014a man with an engineering insignia, the pins on his collar indicating a rank of lieutenant commander. Only when Costa turned him over did he see the milky white of the man\\u2019s eyes, his features bruised but unmistakable.\\n\\n\\u201cCommander La Forge,\\u201d Costa told him. \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay. We\\u2019ve got you.\\u201d\\n\\nLa Forge\\u2019s useless eyes fluttered, his head lolling back and forth.\\n\\n\\u201cNo, no, no,\\u201d the chief engineer babbled, half delirious. \\u201cNo, it can\\u2019t be. This can\\u2019t be happening. Lieutenant Marksen\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re here to help,\\u201d Costa said, trying to calm him down. \\u201cBut we need to get you out of here first.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd Costa had to know.\\n\\nLa Forge slumped back, and spoke in a voice that was not his own.\\n\\nThe chief felt La Forge\\u2019s shock drain into him. From there it filled the entire core, like tentacles wrapping around each member of his team, the living only one heartbeat removed from the dead. Somehow, one of them found the commander\\u2019s VISOR and handed it to Costa. Turning the thing over in his hands, Costa could only imagine the horrors it had drilled into La Forge\\u2019s brain before coming off.\\n\\nBut La Forge wanted it back. He reached for it, knowing it was there.\\n\\nCosta gave the VISOR to him. La Forge snapped it into place, and a moment rose to his own two feet. He refused help, instead steadying himself against the bulkhead until he regained some of his strength. No longer blind, no longer tentative, he then straightened himself out and took in everything around him.\\n\\nThe security team, watching him in trepidation.\\n\\nThe woman\\u2019s body, still in death but by no means peaceful.\\n\\nAnd finally himself, his uniform soaked in blood.\\n\\nBut none of that could compare. Not to the realization of horror that dawned across La Forge\\u2019s face, manifesting itself in a slow, deliberate turn toward the doorway. Costa followed that gaze, as did the others, to find them all trapped\\u2014blocked by a figure more shadow than substance, but unquestionably real in its intentions. It appeared humanoid, but Costa knew better. This was the devil of which La Forge spoke, revealing itself in full.\\n\\nAnd pulled the trigger while he still could.\", \"author\": \"Marc Giller\", \"url\": \"https://noqreport.com/2020/01/27/star-trek-shadow-prime-book-i-chapter-11/\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 15:00:42 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580155242, \"collection_utc\": 1580172402}",News,1580155242

This got them praise for many reasons, but it also made many skeptics point out the fact that all of these cops would still arrest you for a bump stock, fully automatic weapon, or any other number of gun bans enforced on a national level. It was essentially little more than a dog and pony show politicized into a circus. Now, we are seeing a similar refusal take place in Austin, Texas this week. In this case, however, instead of refusing not to arrest people, the Austin police department is promising to keep arresting people\\u2014despite the city council voting to increase freedom by halting marijuana arrests.\\n\\nJust one day after Austin City Council approved a resolution to stop kidnapping, caging, and extorting people over marijuana, the chief of police fired back, proudly exclaiming that he would refuse to uphold the new law and will still conduct arrests and tickets of those dangerous marijuana smokers.\\n\\n\\u201c[Marijuana] is still illegal, and we will still enforce marijuana law if we come across people smoking in the community,\\u201d Chief Brian Manley said during a news conference Friday afternoon.\\n\\nManley said that his cops will continue to either issue tickets under the city\\u2019s \\u201ccite-and-release\\u201d policy or arrest people if officers \\u201ccome across it.\\u201d\\n\\nEssentially, Manley and his team of badged enforcers inside Austin PD say they will continue to violate the rights of innocent people because the devil\\u2019s lettuce is still illegal at the state level. However, Manley\\u2019s promise to disobey Austin\\u2019s new resolution is futile for many reasons, especially considering the fact that the city plans on doing nothing with the citations and letting go everyone the police arrest without charges.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat has changed since yesterday is that enforcement, almost in virtually all cases, is now handing someone a piece of paper with no penalty or no court date,\\u201d Casar said.\\n\\nNevertheless, innocent people will still be kidnapped by Austin cops refusing to obey their democratically elected leaders, and this is little more then insubordinate tyranny.\\n\\nThis change in Austin\\u2019s law comes after hemp was legalized at a federal level. Because cops on the street can\\u2019t tell the difference between federally legal hemp and its psychoactive counterpart, Austin city council came up with the logical decision to stop all enforcement. This is the opposite of what other states like Louisiana are doing. In Louisiana, despite the state legalizing the growing of hemp, possessing the non-psychoactive flower or attempting to smoke it, can and will land you in a cage.\\n\\nManley is apparently just like the cops in Louisiana and is too addicted to going after this plant that\\u2019s never killed anyone, so he and his Austin police department will continue to arrest people for it.\\n\\nDoubling down on his tyrannical act, Manley then claimed at the press conference that the Austin police department is above any petty city ordinance. \\u201cA City Council does not have the authority to tell a police department not to enforce a state law,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nSadly, the Austin police department is representative of many other departments across the country who are so addicted to the war on drugs that they are willing to openly disobey the democratic process that tells them to stop enforcing it. This is not only a boon for the prison industrial complex, but it\\u2019s also a gift to violent criminals who get to act in the background as cops go after weed.\\n\\nAs TFTP has reported, when cops stop going after people for possessing substances deemed illegal by the state, real crimes are actually solved.\\n\\nIn fact, a study out of Boston showed exactly that. The study indicated that the Boston Police Department has drastically increased the number of homicides they solved since they stopped making arrests for marijuana. The homicide clearance rate increase by 10% following the decriminalization of marijuana in the area.\\n\\n\\u201cThe BPD homicide unit increased the yearly Boston homicide clearance rate by nearly 10 percent [\\u2026] and by more than 18 percent when the clearance rate definition was extended to include those cases awaiting grand jury decisions,\\u201d the study said.\\n\\nCivil asset forfeiture pays. Busting low-level drug dealers by the dozen and confiscating their drugs, guns, cars, houses, and money pays. Writing tickets for victimless crime pays. Pulling you over for window tint, seat belts, arbitrary traveling speeds, and expired license plates; these are the things that pay \\u2014 solving murders does not pay.\\n\\nSadly, many cops in Austin are perpetuating actual crime by continuing this war on weed. Hopefully they wake up to this reality soon enough so they end up on the right side of history.\\n\\nMatt Agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the USMC and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the NSA.

The wooden dock and at least 35 vessels went up in flames and an aluminum roof that covered many of the boats melted and collapsed, cutting off escape routes and raining debris over the area as boaters leaped into the river.\\n\\nJones said he was aboard his 35-foot cabin cruiser when someone came banging on the boat after midnight saying, \\u201cMan, the marina is on fire.\\u201d The flames were racing out to the far end of the dock where Jones' boat was tied.\\n\\nJones said he and several other men cut some boats free and sent them drifting out into the water. When a man placed his wife and children into a small boat, they cut that boat free too. Finally, Jones said, he jumped into the water and swam for shore, 200 yards away. He believes his brother Yancey Roper, who lived aboard another boat, swam in a different direction. Officials later told him that his brother had drowned.\\n\\nAs Jones was swimming for shore in water with a temperature in the mid-50s, he said, \\u201cI looked back and that other boat with the wife and the children on it was all engulfed in flames.\\u201d\\n\\nAt least seven people were sent to hospitals suffering from exposure to the flames or the frigid water.\\n\\n\\u201cIt was scary. The worst thing for me is you could hear people screaming for help, and there was nothing we could do. Nobody could do anything to get to them,\\\" said Julie Jackson, who lives with her husband and son in a houseboat on another dock that did not burn.\\n\\nNecklaus said some of the burning boats sank at the dock and others floated away before going under. He said divers need to locate each one and search them individually before they can be sure there were no other victims.\\n\\n\\\"We woke up hearing screams and popping noises,\\\" Mandy Durham, who was with her boyfriend in a nearby boat, told The Associated Press. \\u201cWhen we woke up, we could see red through the window.\\u201d\\n\\n\\\"Within 15 to 20 minutes, the whole dock was in flames,\\\" she added. \\\"All these boats have propane tanks and gas tanks, and that\\u2019s a lot of fire.\\u201d\\n\\nThe blaze destroyed the B dock, about 50 yards (46 meters) from the A dock where the boat of Durham's boyfriend was moored.\\n\\n\\\"There were numerous people rescued from the water who had escaped by going into the water,\\\" Jackson County Chief Sheriff's Deputy Rocky Harnen told the AP shortly after dawn. \\u201cWe're trying to get divers down here to search for possible victims.\\u201d\\n\\nPeople were jumping onto a boat at the end of the dock because fire had consumed the middle portion and that was their only escape. But then the flames spread to that boat, leaving water as their only way out, Durham said.\\n\\n\\\"Water was the only place they had to go,\\\" Durham said. \\u201cIts just extremely sad. It's horrible.\\u201d\\n\\nGeorgia resident Michael Watson said his aunt lived with her husband and five children on one of the boats that burned. He said his aunt was confirmed among the dead and authorities are still looking for the other six family members. Officials have not released the names of any of those killed or missing.\\n\\nHours after sunrise, smoke was still rising from the remains of a wooden dock, and pieces of metal that once formed the roof were partially submerged. Police and fire boats with flashing lights were positioned near the charred remains, and a yellow floating boom was being deployed around the marina to contain spilled fuel.\\n\\nMost of the boats that were destroyed had people living on them permanently, but some mainly spent weekends on them, Durham said. The park includes a boat ramp, a dock and a restaurant, and offers boat rentals, according to Jackson County's government website.\\n\\n\\\"Everybody is just hoping to find the ones they knew on that dock. There were families there. It's devastating,\\\" Durham said.\\n\\nAssociated Press Writer Jeff Martin in Atlanta contributed to this story.\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/fire-chief-hospitalized-missing-alabama-dock-fire-68559267\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 16:30:34 -0500\", \"published_utc\": 1580160634, \"collection_utc\": 1580169990}",News,1580160634

After such shelling in January 2015, local residents were left without heat, electricity, and water supplies for weeks.\\n\\nAt the beginning of 2016, battles for the industrial zone near Avdiyivka have intensified. Control over this \\\"gray zone\\\" allowed ensuring safety to the locals and gaining control of the Donetsk-Luhansk and Debaltseve-Horlivka motorways. Confrontation climaxed in the fall of that year and lasted until the spring of 2017. The enemy heavily engaged Ukrainian troops with weapons proscribed by the Minsk agreements. Several times the militants stormed the industrial zone, but their offensive efforts were repulsed, while Ukrainian forces advanced and gained better positions.\\n\\nIn those battles, the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade played a really important role, holding ground in Avdiyivka for 375 days and nights. Six fighters were awarded Bohdan Khmelnytsky orders (including one posthumously). The order of courage was awarded to 20 fighters (seven posthumously). Lieutenant Vasyl Tarasiuk and Captain Andriy Kizilo (posthumously) were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine.\\n\\nOleksandr Vdovichenko (call sign \\\"Slavian\\\"), a former battalion commander and now chief of staff with the 28th Brigade, told UNIAN how his fighters forced the militant grouping led by an infamous warlord Givi (who was later assassinated in Donetsk) to retreat, repelled the attacks of the \\\"elite\\\" DPR troops, and prevented an attack using photos of their tanks as a decoy, survived, and complied with their commander's order: \\\"Don't die!\\\"\\n\\nTell us about the first days at Avdiyivka's industrial zone.\\n\\nWe deployed in the Avdiyivka industrial zone in October 2016, and on the very first day, we came under enemy fire. Before that, we had not been involved in the ATO for six months, working with NATO instructors at a training ground, then we were held in reserve, based in the rear of Donetsk region. And my first thought in Avdiyivka was: \\\"I guess I'm going to die here.\\\"\\n\\nIt was really scary. First, we came under mortar fire. Everyone rushed into the basement and just waited. As we were moving along our positions, we came under machine gunfire. We ducked and lay there with our chief of recon, and after a few minutes I said to him: \\\"Actually, it's not scary anymore.\\\" And he went: \\u201cit's alright, you'll get used to it.\\\"\\n\\nAt that time, shelling never stopped. While artillery could be silent during daytime, automatic \\\"chatter\\\" did not subside, it was constant. When the first frost hit, the leaves fell from the trees and we were at the enemy's plain sight. There were no trenches at all. There were perhaps just two of them throughout the industrial zone. So we began to dig in order to survive.\\n\\nI will say that we were pretty well supplied at that time already. What we lacked was camouflage nets, thermal imagers, and generators ... But volunteers would bring this, too.\\n\\nWhen did the militants go for an offensive?\\n\\nThree days later, we changed positions and the airborne assault unit came in, and that's when I took command of the area and that very evening we got intercepted enemy communications. \\\"Sparrow\\\", the commander of the reconnaissance platoon of the Somali battalion, wrote to Givi: \\\"Man, we are in position, ready for the assault.\\\" The response was: \\\"Wait, let the artillery work a bit more.\\\" We could not understand where exactly they would strike ... But time passed, and from the forefront, our \\u201cRomeo\\u201d and \\u201cDragon\\u201d report: the enemy is around them. The enemy started to try and penetrate so we repelled their offensive with grenades.\\n\\nThen we had three of our men wounded. The enemy also suffered losses, but they were ready for this and did not retreat. In intercepted comms we heard Givi commands: \\\"Take them alive.\\\"\\n\\nI sent in a reserve group, but their artillery worked so hard that we could not approach those positions, we could not even get out of our command post. I just didn't know what to do. And then for the first time I gave the command to open fire at the enemy, practically next to our positions.There were basements, I drove everyone there and wrote to the commander of our mortar battery: \\\"Eugene, please, don\\u2019t hit our men\\u2026 \\\"And he dropped about forty mines on those bastards.\\n\\nThank God, we suffered no losses, while they had seven or eight KIAs. But Givi was only pumped up by those losses. He deployed the reserve and began to prepare for a new assault. And only after our artillery hit his command post and he was injured, he ordered to retreat.\\n\\nWe asked the JCCC (Joint Center for Monitoring and Coordinating Ceasefire and Stabilization of the Contact Line) to evacuate the wounded but they didn\\u2019t hear us...\\n\\nAnd how did further battles unfold?\\n\\nThe next day we reviewed the defense system and strengthened it. We planted more MON-50s (anti-personnel mines), stocked up on grenades and all we had at disposal. We realized that there is only one way out: it's either we or they. It became clear that if we didn't open fire, we would be dead. So we hit them with everything we had \\u2013 mortars, tanks, IFVs... The order to open fire was: \\\"Death to Novorossiya.\\\"\\n\\nDay after day, the industrial zone was practically bleeding, but we managed to stabilize the frontline in an incredible effort. At first we were in a semi-encirclement, but gradually we advanced along the flanks and deployed a \\u201chorseshoe\\u201d towards the enemy. Givi realized that he was finished so he retreated to be replaced by the \\\"Vostok Battalion\\\".\\n\\nWe survived. And we had no losses for a long time... But in three weeks we had one of our men killed.\\n\\nI tell everyone that I was in command of the best people. They could do everything. All of the \\u201cDPR\\u201d and the Russian Federation were against us. In February 2017, battles were ongoing from morning to night hours. Artillery fire never stopped. We once had no sleep in five days. It was freezing, but there was no trace of snow \\u2013 everything was black at our positions. Some say: \\\"The shell will not hit the same spot twice.\\\" Not true. It does, two, three, and four times. Everything was plowed. Everything was drenched in blood. And no one was originally going to fight like that for this piece of land. But after our guys were killed, it became a matter of principle.\\n\\nIt was like in those movies about Stalingrad. We would bring 16 men to the positions in the morning only to take them back out during the day. Volunteers also went to the positions: cooks, artillerymen, tankers. There was a doctor in the second company, callsign \\\"Seagull\\\", a nice, positive guy. Shelling began at the Almaz position, and at some point, he took over command and managed things no worse than some officer. The whole team was fighting for this piece of land, the position later renamed in honor of my late deputy Andriy Kizilo callsign \\\"Eagle\\\".\\n\\nBut the militants weren't giving up. They shelled Avdiyivka with \\\"Grad\\\" missiles and used heavy artillery. There was a time when the evacuation began, our forces were getting ready to retreat from the city ... But we put two tanks at the \\\"nines\\\" (nine-story buildings on the outskirts of the city), where journalists could take pictures of them. And so came news reports: \\\"Ukraine Army is ready for an offensive. There is no ceasefire deal.\\\" And the enemy abandoned their offensive plans. That's how we tricked them. We survived.\\n\\nWhat was the hardest moment for you back then?\\n\\nOnce I was called to the headquarters to get awards for my men. I took several dozen orders in Kyiv to take to the battalion. I called my chief of staff: \\\"Tomorrow I\\u2019m going to greet my men, so tell me who's where.\\\" I come to him next morning and several boxes with rewards are still on his table. I exploded: \\\"What the hell? Why didn\\u2019t you complete the task?\\\" He said, \\\"There is nobody to reward ... \\\" It turned out that some of them was killed and the rest were injured. At that moment I wish I were dead...\\n\\nThen a tough truce began. In the spring, three of our men were killed in mortar shelling. Then a direct hit to a dugout \\u2013 and another two KIAs. I almost lost it. I gave the order: \\\"Don't die\\\" and told them to make sure everyone heard that order...\\n\\nYou know what was my biggest reward? At the Eagle position we once came under mortar fire. A soldier was injured when he covered me from a fragment hit with his body. I yelled at him: \\\"What are you doing?\\\" He said, \\\"If you're killed, then we're all finished.\\\" Two times my soldiers covered me. I think there can be no better reward. All who participated in those fierce battles are heroes. Legends were born there that are now defending the country. I had the honor of commanding the best people.\\n\\nDid you talk with POWs then? And what did the militants say about you?\\n\\nThey [militants] loathed and feared us.\\n\\nWe were so bad we could launch 40 mines in response to a single gun burst in our direction. They were just waiting for us to go for a rotation. And when we were leaving, they didn't fire a single shot at us.\\n\\nI talked with prisoners in 2014-2017, and every year their faith in victory was becoming stronger and stronger. This is not the case with us. The war divided our country into two parts. The ATO or JFO is interesting to those who are in the ATO and to a small part of the country. The rest are weary. And in the news we hear all the time: \\\"A veteran killed someone\\\", \\\"A veteran is a suspect\\\", \\\" A grenade was found\\\", crap like that... And no one cares where you fought, how you fought, and if you have a PTSD\\u2026 Nobody tells anyone how we fought and how we survived. Right now we have a truce, but day after day there are new losses. It seems as if there are no battles but another sniper shot and there goes another \\\"200\\\" (KIA, killed in action).\\n\\nI wrote a book about how we fought, to let people know about the heroes\\u2026 I don't want to talk about what is happening now in the Army, I am an officer with the Armed Forces, my task is to defend the country and follow orders. But who is Lieutenant Colonel Vdovichenko now? One of the hundreds of lieutenant colonels. But who was battalion commander, lieutenant colonel Vdovichenko back then? A man followed by hundreds of best fighters, without hesitation, into fiercest battles. Something like this...\\n\\nMany times in Avdiyivka I wanted to die, I was looking for that death, but it never came by... But I reconsidered my life. A year ago, my wife gave me a son, my little Sasha! Now I want to live as long as possible. I have drawn conclusions. There are things that we can't change, we can only change our attitude towards them. I learned to let go of situations and people.

After such shelling in January 2015, local residents were left without heat, electricity, and water supplies for weeks.\\n\\nAt the beginning of 2016, battles for the industrial zone near Avdiyivka have intensified. Control over this \\\"gray zone\\\" allowed ensuring safety to the locals and gaining control of the Donetsk-Luhansk and Debaltseve-Horlivka motorways. Confrontation climaxed in the fall of that year and lasted until the spring of 2017. The enemy heavily engaged Ukrainian troops with weapons proscribed by the Minsk agreements. Several times the militants stormed the industrial zone, but their offensive efforts were repulsed, while Ukrainian forces advanced and gained better positions.\\n\\nIn those battles, the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade played a really important role, holding ground in Avdiyivka for 375 days and nights. Six fighters were awarded Bohdan Khmelnytsky orders (including one posthumously). The order of courage was awarded to 20 fighters (seven posthumously). Lieutenant Vasyl Tarasiuk and Captain Andriy Kizilo (posthumously) were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine.\\n\\nOleksandr Vdovichenko (call sign \\\"Slavian\\\"), a former battalion commander and now chief of staff with the 28th Brigade, told UNIAN how his fighters forced the militant grouping led by an infamous warlord Givi (who was later assassinated in Donetsk) to retreat, repelled the attacks of the \\\"elite\\\" DPR troops, and prevented an attack using photos of their tanks as a decoy, survived, and complied with their commander's order: \\\"Don't die!\\\"\\n\\nTell us about the first days at Avdiyivka's industrial zone.\\n\\nWe deployed in the Avdiyivka industrial zone in October 2016, and on the very first day, we came under enemy fire. Before that, we had not been involved in the ATO for six months, working with NATO instructors at a training ground, then we were held in reserve, based in the rear of Donetsk region. And my first thought in Avdiyivka was: \\\"I guess I'm going to die here.\\\"\\n\\nIt was really scary. First, we came under mortar fire. Everyone rushed into the basement and just waited. As we were moving along our positions, we came under machine gunfire. We ducked and lay there with our chief of recon, and after a few minutes I said to him: \\\"Actually, it's not scary anymore.\\\" And he went: \\u201cit's alright, you'll get used to it.\\\"\\n\\nAt that time, shelling never stopped. While artillery could be silent during daytime, automatic \\\"chatter\\\" did not subside, it was constant. When the first frost hit, the leaves fell from the trees and we were at the enemy's plain sight. There were no trenches at all. There were perhaps just two of them throughout the industrial zone. So we began to dig in order to survive.\\n\\nI will say that we were pretty well supplied at that time already. What we lacked was camouflage nets, thermal imagers, and generators ... But volunteers would bring this, too.\\n\\nWhen did the militants go for an offensive?\\n\\nThree days later, we changed positions and the airborne assault unit came in, and that's when I took command of the area and that very evening we got intercepted enemy communications. \\\"Sparrow\\\", the commander of the reconnaissance platoon of the Somali battalion, wrote to Givi: \\\"Man, we are in position, ready for the assault.\\\" The response was: \\\"Wait, let the artillery work a bit more.\\\" We could not understand where exactly they would strike ... But time passed, and from the forefront, our \\u201cRomeo\\u201d and \\u201cDragon\\u201d report: the enemy is around them. The enemy started to try and penetrate so we repelled their offensive with grenades.\\n\\nThen we had three of our men wounded. The enemy also suffered losses, but they were ready for this and did not retreat. In intercepted comms we heard Givi commands: \\\"Take them alive.\\\"\\n\\nI sent in a reserve group, but their artillery worked so hard that we could not approach those positions, we could not even get out of our command post. I just didn't know what to do. And then for the first time I gave the command to open fire at the enemy, practically next to our positions.There were basements, I drove everyone there and wrote to the commander of our mortar battery: \\\"Eugene, please, don\\u2019t hit our men\\u2026 \\\"And he dropped about forty mines on those bastards.\\n\\nThank God, we suffered no losses, while they had seven or eight KIAs. But Givi was only pumped up by those losses. He deployed the reserve and began to prepare for a new assault. And only after our artillery hit his command post and he was injured, he ordered to retreat.\\n\\nWe asked the JCCC (Joint Center for Monitoring and Coordinating Ceasefire and Stabilization of the Contact Line) to evacuate the wounded but they didn\\u2019t hear us...\\n\\nAnd how did further battles unfold?\\n\\nThe next day we reviewed the defense system and strengthened it. We planted more MON-50s (anti-personnel mines), stocked up on grenades and all we had at disposal. We realized that there is only one way out: it's either we or they. It became clear that if we didn't open fire, we would be dead. So we hit them with everything we had \\u2013 mortars, tanks, IFVs... The order to open fire was: \\\"Death to Novorossiya.\\\"\\n\\nDay after day, the industrial zone was practically bleeding, but we managed to stabilize the frontline in an incredible effort. At first we were in a semi-encirclement, but gradually we advanced along the flanks and deployed a \\u201chorseshoe\\u201d towards the enemy. Givi realized that he was finished so he retreated to be replaced by the \\\"Vostok Battalion\\\".\\n\\nWe survived. And we had no losses for a long time... But in three weeks we had one of our men killed.\\n\\nI tell everyone that I was in command of the best people. They could do everything. All of the \\u201cDPR\\u201d and the Russian Federation were against us. In February 2017, battles were ongoing from morning to night hours. Artillery fire never stopped. We once had no sleep in five days. It was freezing, but there was no trace of snow \\u2013 everything was black at our positions. Some say: \\\"The shell will not hit the same spot twice.\\\" Not true. It does, two, three, and four times. Everything was plowed. Everything was drenched in blood. And no one was originally going to fight like that for this piece of land. But after our guys were killed, it became a matter of principle.\\n\\nIt was like in those movies about Stalingrad. We would bring 16 men to the positions in the morning only to take them back out during the day. Volunteers also went to the positions: cooks, artillerymen, tankers. There was a doctor in the second company, callsign \\\"Seagull\\\", a nice, positive guy. Shelling began at the Almaz position, and at some point, he took over command and managed things no worse than some officer. The whole team was fighting for this piece of land, the position later renamed in honor of my late deputy Andriy Kizilo callsign \\\"Eagle\\\".\\n\\nBut the militants weren't giving up. They shelled Avdiyivka with \\\"Grad\\\" missiles and used heavy artillery. There was a time when the evacuation began, our forces were getting ready to retreat from the city ... But we put two tanks at the \\\"nines\\\" (nine-story buildings on the outskirts of the city), where journalists could take pictures of them. And so came news reports: \\\"Ukraine Army is ready for an offensive. There is no ceasefire deal.\\\" And the enemy abandoned their offensive plans. That's how we tricked them. We survived.\\n\\nWhat was the hardest moment for you back then?\\n\\nOnce I was called to the headquarters to get awards for my men. I took several dozen orders in Kyiv to take to the battalion.

Lieutenant Vasyl Tarasiuk and Captain Andriy Kizilo (posthumously) were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine.\\n\\nOleksandr Vdovichenko (call sign \\\"Slavian\\\"), a former battalion commander and now chief of staff with the 28th Brigade, told UNIAN how his fighters forced the militant grouping led by an infamous warlord Givi (who was later assassinated in Donetsk) to retreat, repelled the attacks of the \\\"elite\\\" DPR troops, and prevented an attack using photos of their tanks as a decoy, survived, and complied with their commander's order: \\\"Don't die!\\\"\\n\\nTell us about the first days at Avdiyivka's industrial zone.\\n\\nWe deployed in the Avdiyivka industrial zone in October 2016, and on the very first day, we came under enemy fire. Before that, we had not been involved in the ATO for six months, working with NATO instructors at a training ground, then we were held in reserve, based in the rear of Donetsk region. And my first thought in Avdiyivka was: \\\"I guess I'm going to die here.\\\"\\n\\nIt was really scary. First, we came under mortar fire. Everyone rushed into the basement and just waited. As we were moving along our positions, we came under machine gunfire. We ducked and lay there with our chief of recon, and after a few minutes I said to him: \\\"Actually, it's not scary anymore.\\\" And he went: \\u201cit's alright, you'll get used to it.\\\"\\n\\nAt that time, shelling never stopped. While artillery could be silent during daytime, automatic \\\"chatter\\\" did not subside, it was constant. When the first frost hit, the leaves fell from the trees and we were at the enemy's plain sight. There were no trenches at all. There were perhaps just two of them throughout the industrial zone. So we began to dig in order to survive.\\n\\nI will say that we were pretty well supplied at that time already. What we lacked was camouflage nets, thermal imagers, and generators ... But volunteers would bring this, too.\\n\\nWhen did the militants go for an offensive?\\n\\nThree days later, we changed positions and the airborne assault unit came in, and that's when I took command of the area and that very evening we got intercepted enemy communications. \\\"Sparrow\\\", the commander of the reconnaissance platoon of the Somali battalion, wrote to Givi: \\\"Man, we are in position, ready for the assault.\\\" The response was: \\\"Wait, let the artillery work a bit more.\\\" We could not understand where exactly they would strike ... But time passed, and from the forefront, our \\u201cRomeo\\u201d and \\u201cDragon\\u201d report: the enemy is around them. The enemy started to try and penetrate so we repelled their offensive with grenades.\\n\\nThen we had three of our men wounded. The enemy also suffered losses, but they were ready for this and did not retreat. In intercepted comms we heard Givi commands: \\\"Take them alive.\\\"\\n\\nI sent in a reserve group, but their artillery worked so hard that we could not approach those positions, we could not even get out of our command post. I just didn't know what to do. And then for the first time I gave the command to open fire at the enemy, practically next to our positions.There were basements, I drove everyone there and wrote to the commander of our mortar battery: \\\"Eugene, please, don\\u2019t hit our men\\u2026 \\\"And he dropped about forty mines on those bastards.\\n\\nThank God, we suffered no losses, while they had seven or eight KIAs. But Givi was only pumped up by those losses. He deployed the reserve and began to prepare for a new assault. And only after our artillery hit his command post and he was injured, he ordered to retreat.\\n\\nWe asked the JCCC (Joint Center for Monitoring and Coordinating Ceasefire and Stabilization of the Contact Line) to evacuate the wounded but they didn\\u2019t hear us...\\n\\nAnd how did further battles unfold?\\n\\nThe next day we reviewed the defense system and strengthened it. We planted more MON-50s (anti-personnel mines), stocked up on grenades and all we had at disposal. We realized that there is only one way out: it's either we or they. It became clear that if we didn't open fire, we would be dead. So we hit them with everything we had \\u2013 mortars, tanks, IFVs... The order to open fire was: \\\"Death to Novorossiya.\\\"\\n\\nDay after day, the industrial zone was practically bleeding, but we managed to stabilize the frontline in an incredible effort. At first we were in a semi-encirclement, but gradually we advanced along the flanks and deployed a \\u201chorseshoe\\u201d towards the enemy. Givi realized that he was finished so he retreated to be replaced by the \\\"Vostok Battalion\\\".\\n\\nWe survived. And we had no losses for a long time... But in three weeks we had one of our men killed.\\n\\nI tell everyone that I was in command of the best people. They could do everything. All of the \\u201cDPR\\u201d and the Russian Federation were against us. In February 2017, battles were ongoing from morning to night hours. Artillery fire never stopped. We once had no sleep in five days. It was freezing, but there was no trace of snow \\u2013 everything was black at our positions. Some say: \\\"The shell will not hit the same spot twice.\\\" Not true. It does, two, three, and four times. Everything was plowed. Everything was drenched in blood. And no one was originally going to fight like that for this piece of land. But after our guys were killed, it became a matter of principle.\\n\\nIt was like in those movies about Stalingrad. We would bring 16 men to the positions in the morning only to take them back out during the day. Volunteers also went to the positions: cooks, artillerymen, tankers. There was a doctor in the second company, callsign \\\"Seagull\\\", a nice, positive guy. Shelling began at the Almaz position, and at some point, he took over command and managed things no worse than some officer. The whole team was fighting for this piece of land, the position later renamed in honor of my late deputy Andriy Kizilo callsign \\\"Eagle\\\".\\n\\nBut the militants weren't giving up. They shelled Avdiyivka with \\\"Grad\\\" missiles and used heavy artillery. There was a time when the evacuation began, our forces were getting ready to retreat from the city ... But we put two tanks at the \\\"nines\\\" (nine-story buildings on the outskirts of the city), where journalists could take pictures of them. And so came news reports: \\\"Ukraine Army is ready for an offensive. There is no ceasefire deal.\\\" And the enemy abandoned their offensive plans. That's how we tricked them. We survived.\\n\\nWhat was the hardest moment for you back then?\\n\\nOnce I was called to the headquarters to get awards for my men. I took several dozen orders in Kyiv to take to the battalion. I called my chief of staff: \\\"Tomorrow I\\u2019m going to greet my men, so tell me who's where.\\\" I come to him next morning and several boxes with rewards are still on his table. I exploded: \\\"What the hell? Why didn\\u2019t you complete the task?\\\" He said, \\\"There is nobody to reward ... \\\" It turned out that some of them was killed and the rest were injured. At that moment I wish I were dead...\\n\\nThen a tough truce began. In the spring, three of our men were killed in mortar shelling. Then a direct hit to a dugout \\u2013 and another two KIAs. I almost lost it. I gave the order: \\\"Don't die\\\" and told them to make sure everyone heard that order...\\n\\nYou know what was my biggest reward? At the Eagle position we once came under mortar fire. A soldier was injured when he covered me from a fragment hit with his body. I yelled at him: \\\"What are you doing?\\\" He said, \\\"If you're killed, then we're all finished.\\\" Two times my soldiers covered me. I think there can be no better reward. All who participated in those fierce battles are heroes. Legends were born there that are now defending the country. I had the honor of commanding the best people.\\n\\nDid you talk with POWs then? And what did the militants say about you?\\n\\nThey [militants] loathed and feared us.\\n\\nWe were so bad we could launch 40 mines in response to a single gun burst in our direction. They were just waiting for us to go for a rotation. And when we were leaving, they didn't fire a single shot at us.\\n\\nI talked with prisoners in 2014-2017, and every year their faith in victory was becoming stronger and stronger. This is not the case with us. The war divided our country into two parts. The ATO or JFO is interesting to those who are in the ATO and to a small part of the country. The rest are weary. And in the news we hear all the time: \\\"A veteran killed someone\\\", \\\"A veteran is a suspect\\\", \\\" A grenade was found\\\", crap like that... And no one cares where you fought, how you fought, and if you have a PTSD\\u2026 Nobody tells anyone how we fought and how we survived. Right now we have a truce, but day after day there are new losses. It seems as if there are no battles but another sniper shot and there goes another \\\"200\\\" (KIA, killed in action).\\n\\nI wrote a book about how we fought, to let people know about the heroes\\u2026 I don't want to talk about what is happening now in the Army, I am an officer with the Armed Forces, my task is to defend the country and follow orders. But who is Lieutenant Colonel Vdovichenko now? One of the hundreds of lieutenant colonels. But who was battalion commander, lieutenant colonel Vdovichenko back then? A man followed by hundreds of best fighters, without hesitation, into fiercest battles. Something like this...\\n\\nMany times in Avdiyivka I wanted to die, I was looking for that death, but it never came by... But I reconsidered my life. A year ago, my wife gave me a son, my little Sasha! Now I want to live as long as possible. I have drawn conclusions. There are things that we can't change, we can only change our attitude towards them. I learned to let go of situations and people. Whoever's with me I'm glad to have them around, and whoever's not \\u2013 I'm not trying to change anyone and I don\\u2019t want to understand anyone. In one film, I heard: \\\"Everything always ends well. If it ends badly, that's not the end yet.\\\"\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.unian.info/war/10847180-former-battalion-commander-with-72nd-brigade-oleksandr-vdovichenko-my-first-thought-in-avdiyivka-was-i-guess-i-m-going-to-die-here.html\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 17:50:00 +0200\", \"published_utc\": 1580165400, \"collection_utc\": 1580171680}",News,1580165400

They shelled Avdiyivka with \\\"Grad\\\" missiles and used heavy artillery. There was a time when the evacuation began, our forces were getting ready to retreat from the city ... But we put two tanks at the \\\"nines\\\" (nine-story buildings on the outskirts of the city), where journalists could take pictures of them.

We survived.\\n\\nWhat was the hardest moment for you back then?\\n\\nOnce I was called to the headquarters to get awards for my men. I took several dozen orders in Kyiv to take to the battalion. I called my chief of staff: \\\"Tomorrow I\\u2019m going to greet my men, so tell me who's where.\\\" I come to him next morning and several boxes with rewards are still on his table. I exploded: \\\"What the hell? Why didn\\u2019t you complete the task?\\\" He said, \\\"There is nobody to reward ... \\\" It turned out that some of them was killed and the rest were injured. At that moment I wish I were dead...\\n\\nThen a tough truce began. In the spring, three of our men were killed in mortar shelling. Then a direct hit to a dugout \\u2013 and another two KIAs. I almost lost it. I gave the order: \\\"Don't die\\\" and told them to make sure everyone heard that order...\\n\\nYou know what was my biggest reward? At the Eagle position we once came under mortar fire. A soldier was injured when he covered me from a fragment hit with his body. I yelled at him: \\\"What are you doing?\\\" He said, \\\"If you're killed, then we're all finished.\\\" Two times my soldiers covered me. I think there can be no better reward.

After such shelling in January 2015, local residents were left without heat, electricity, and water supplies for weeks.\\n\\nAt the beginning of 2016, battles for the industrial zone near Avdiyivka have intensified. Control over this \\\"gray zone\\\" allowed ensuring safety to the locals and gaining control of the Donetsk-Luhansk and Debaltseve-Horlivka motorways. Confrontation climaxed in the fall of that year and lasted until the spring of 2017. The enemy heavily engaged Ukrainian troops with weapons proscribed by the Minsk agreements. Several times the militants stormed the industrial zone, but their offensive efforts were repulsed, while Ukrainian forces advanced and gained better positions.\\n\\nIn those battles, the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade played a really important role, holding ground in Avdiyivka for 375 days and nights. Six fighters were awarded Bohdan Khmelnytsky orders (including one posthumously). The order of courage was awarded to 20 fighters (seven posthumously). Lieutenant Vasyl Tarasiuk and Captain Andriy Kizilo (posthumously) were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine.\\n\\nOleksandr Vdovichenko (call sign \\\"Slavian\\\"), a former battalion commander and now chief of staff with the 28th Brigade, told UNIAN how his fighters forced the militant grouping led by an infamous warlord Givi (who was later assassinated in Donetsk) to retreat, repelled the attacks of the \\\"elite\\\" DPR troops, and prevented an attack using photos of their tanks as a decoy, survived, and complied with their commander's order: \\\"Don't die!\\\"\\n\\nTell us about the first days at Avdiyivka's industrial zone.\\n\\nWe deployed in the Avdiyivka industrial zone in October 2016, and on the very first day, we came under enemy fire. Before that, we had not been involved in the ATO for six months, working with NATO instructors at a training ground, then we were held in reserve, based in the rear of Donetsk region. And my first thought in Avdiyivka was: \\\"I guess I'm going to die here.\\\"\\n\\nIt was really scary. First, we came under mortar fire. Everyone rushed into the basement and just waited. As we were moving along our positions, we came under machine gunfire. We ducked and lay there with our chief of recon, and after a few minutes I said to him: \\\"Actually, it's not scary anymore.\\\" And he went: \\u201cit's alright, you'll get used to it.\\\"\\n\\nAt that time, shelling never stopped. While artillery could be silent during daytime, automatic \\\"chatter\\\" did not subside, it was constant. When the first frost hit, the leaves fell from the trees and we were at the enemy's plain sight. There were no trenches at all. There were perhaps just two of them throughout the industrial zone. So we began to dig in order to survive.\\n\\nI will say that we were pretty well supplied at that time already. What we lacked was camouflage nets, thermal imagers, and generators ... But volunteers would bring this, too.\\n\\nWhen did the militants go for an offensive?\\n\\nThree days later, we changed positions and the airborne assault unit came in, and that's when I took command of the area and that very evening we got intercepted enemy communications. \\\"Sparrow\\\", the commander of the reconnaissance platoon of the Somali battalion, wrote to Givi: \\\"Man, we are in position, ready for the assault.\\\" The response was: \\\"Wait, let the artillery work a bit more.\\\" We could not understand where exactly they would strike ... But time passed, and from the forefront, our \\u201cRomeo\\u201d and \\u201cDragon\\u201d report: the enemy is around them. The enemy started to try and penetrate so we repelled their offensive with grenades.\\n\\nThen we had three of our men wounded. The enemy also suffered losses, but they were ready for this and did not retreat. In intercepted comms we heard Givi commands: \\\"Take them alive.\\\"\\n\\nI sent in a reserve group, but their artillery worked so hard that we could not approach those positions, we could not even get out of our command post. I just didn't know what to do. And then for the first time I gave the command to open fire at the enemy, practically next to our positions.There were basements, I drove everyone there and wrote to the commander of our mortar battery: \\\"Eugene, please, don\\u2019t hit our men\\u2026 \\\"And he dropped about forty mines on those bastards.\\n\\nThank God, we suffered no losses, while they had seven or eight KIAs. But Givi was only pumped up by those losses. He deployed the reserve and began to prepare for a new assault. And only after our artillery hit his command post and he was injured, he ordered to retreat.\\n\\nWe asked the JCCC (Joint Center for Monitoring and Coordinating Ceasefire and Stabilization of the Contact Line) to evacuate the wounded but they didn\\u2019t hear us...\\n\\nAnd how did further battles unfold?\\n\\nThe next day we reviewed the defense system and strengthened it. We planted more MON-50s (anti-personnel mines), stocked up on grenades and all we had at disposal. We realized that there is only one way out: it's either we or they. It became clear that if we didn't open fire, we would be dead. So we hit them with everything we had \\u2013 mortars, tanks, IFVs... The order to open fire was: \\\"Death to Novorossiya.\\\"\\n\\nDay after day, the industrial zone was practically bleeding, but we managed to stabilize the frontline in an incredible effort. At first we were in a semi-encirclement, but gradually we advanced along the flanks and deployed a \\u201chorseshoe\\u201d towards the enemy. Givi realized that he was finished so he retreated to be replaced by the \\\"Vostok Battalion\\\".\\n\\nWe survived. And we had no losses for a long time... But in three weeks we had one of our men killed.\\n\\nI tell everyone that I was in command of the best people. They could do everything. All of the \\u201cDPR\\u201d and the Russian Federation were against us. In February 2017, battles were ongoing from morning to night hours. Artillery fire never stopped. We once had no sleep in five days. It was freezing, but there was no trace of snow \\u2013 everything was black at our positions. Some say: \\\"The shell will not hit the same spot twice.\\\" Not true. It does, two, three, and four times. Everything was plowed. Everything was drenched in blood. And no one was originally going to fight like that for this piece of land. But after our guys were killed, it became a matter of principle.\\n\\nIt was like in those movies about Stalingrad. We would bring 16 men to the positions in the morning only to take them back out during the day. Volunteers also went to the positions: cooks, artillerymen, tankers. There was a doctor in the second company, callsign \\\"Seagull\\\", a nice, positive guy. Shelling began at the Almaz position, and at some point, he took over command and managed things no worse than some officer. The whole team was fighting for this piece of land, the position later renamed in honor of my late deputy Andriy Kizilo callsign \\\"Eagle\\\".\\n\\nBut the militants weren't giving up.

I called my chief of staff: \\\"Tomorrow I\\u2019m going to greet my men, so tell me who's where.\\\" I come to him next morning and several boxes with rewards are still on his table. I exploded: \\\"What the hell? Why didn\\u2019t you complete the task?\\\" He said, \\\"There is nobody to reward ... \\\" It turned out that some of them was killed and the rest were injured.

Confrontation climaxed in the fall of that year and lasted until the spring of 2017. The enemy heavily engaged Ukrainian troops with weapons proscribed by the Minsk agreements. Several times the militants stormed the industrial zone, but their offensive efforts were repulsed, while Ukrainian forces advanced and gained better positions.\\n\\nIn those battles, the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade played a really important role, holding ground in Avdiyivka for 375 days and nights. Six fighters were awarded Bohdan Khmelnytsky orders (including one posthumously). The order of courage was awarded to 20 fighters (seven posthumously). Lieutenant Vasyl Tarasiuk and Captain Andriy Kizilo (posthumously) were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine.\\n\\nOleksandr Vdovichenko (call sign \\\"Slavian\\\"), a former battalion commander and now chief of staff with the 28th Brigade, told UNIAN how his fighters forced the militant grouping led by an infamous warlord Givi (who was later assassinated in Donetsk) to retreat, repelled the attacks of the \\\"elite\\\" DPR troops, and prevented an attack using photos of their tanks as a decoy, survived, and complied with their commander's order: \\\"Don't die!\\\"\\n\\nTell us about the first days at Avdiyivka's industrial zone.\\n\\nWe deployed in the Avdiyivka industrial zone in October 2016, and on the very first day, we came under enemy fire. Before that, we had not been involved in the ATO for six months, working with NATO instructors at a training ground, then we were held in reserve, based in the rear of Donetsk region. And my first thought in Avdiyivka was: \\\"I guess I'm going to die here.\\\"\\n\\nIt was really scary. First, we came under mortar fire. Everyone rushed into the basement and just waited. As we were moving along our positions, we came under machine gunfire. We ducked and lay there with our chief of recon, and after a few minutes I said to him: \\\"Actually, it's not scary anymore.\\\" And he went: \\u201cit's alright, you'll get used to it.\\\"\\n\\nAt that time, shelling never stopped. While artillery could be silent during daytime, automatic \\\"chatter\\\" did not subside, it was constant. When the first frost hit, the leaves fell from the trees and we were at the enemy's plain sight. There were no trenches at all. There were perhaps just two of them throughout the industrial zone. So we began to dig in order to survive.\\n\\nI will say that we were pretty well supplied at that time already. What we lacked was camouflage nets, thermal imagers, and generators ... But volunteers would bring this, too.\\n\\nWhen did the militants go for an offensive?\\n\\nThree days later, we changed positions and the airborne assault unit came in, and that's when I took command of the area and that very evening we got intercepted enemy communications. \\\"Sparrow\\\", the commander of the reconnaissance platoon of the Somali battalion, wrote to Givi: \\\"Man, we are in position, ready for the assault.\\\" The response was: \\\"Wait, let the artillery work a bit more.\\\" We could not understand where exactly they would strike ... But time passed, and from the forefront, our \\u201cRomeo\\u201d and \\u201cDragon\\u201d report: the enemy is around them. The enemy started to try and penetrate so we repelled their offensive with grenades.\\n\\nThen we had three of our men wounded. The enemy also suffered losses, but they were ready for this and did not retreat. In intercepted comms we heard Givi commands: \\\"Take them alive.\\\"\\n\\nI sent in a reserve group, but their artillery worked so hard that we could not approach those positions, we could not even get out of our command post. I just didn't know what to do. And then for the first time I gave the command to open fire at the enemy, practically next to our positions.There were basements, I drove everyone there and wrote to the commander of our mortar battery: \\\"Eugene, please, don\\u2019t hit our men\\u2026 \\\"And he dropped about forty mines on those bastards.\\n\\nThank God, we suffered no losses, while they had seven or eight KIAs. But Givi was only pumped up by those losses. He deployed the reserve and began to prepare for a new assault. And only after our artillery hit his command post and he was injured, he ordered to retreat.\\n\\nWe asked the JCCC (Joint Center for Monitoring and Coordinating Ceasefire and Stabilization of the Contact Line) to evacuate the wounded but they didn\\u2019t hear us...\\n\\nAnd how did further battles unfold?\\n\\nThe next day we reviewed the defense system and strengthened it. We planted more MON-50s (anti-personnel mines), stocked up on grenades and all we had at disposal. We realized that there is only one way out: it's either we or they. It became clear that if we didn't open fire, we would be dead. So we hit them with everything we had \\u2013 mortars, tanks, IFVs... The order to open fire was: \\\"Death to Novorossiya.\\\"\\n\\nDay after day, the industrial zone was practically bleeding, but we managed to stabilize the frontline in an incredible effort. At first we were in a semi-encirclement, but gradually we advanced along the flanks and deployed a \\u201chorseshoe\\u201d towards the enemy. Givi realized that he was finished so he retreated to be replaced by the \\\"Vostok Battalion\\\".\\n\\nWe survived. And we had no losses for a long time... But in three weeks we had one of our men killed.\\n\\nI tell everyone that I was in command of the best people. They could do everything. All of the \\u201cDPR\\u201d and the Russian Federation were against us. In February 2017, battles were ongoing from morning to night hours. Artillery fire never stopped. We once had no sleep in five days. It was freezing, but there was no trace of snow \\u2013 everything was black at our positions. Some say: \\\"The shell will not hit the same spot twice.\\\" Not true. It does, two, three, and four times. Everything was plowed. Everything was drenched in blood. And no one was originally going to fight like that for this piece of land. But after our guys were killed, it became a matter of principle.\\n\\nIt was like in those movies about Stalingrad. We would bring 16 men to the positions in the morning only to take them back out during the day. Volunteers also went to the positions: cooks, artillerymen, tankers. There was a doctor in the second company, callsign \\\"Seagull\\\", a nice, positive guy. Shelling began at the Almaz position, and at some point, he took over command and managed things no worse than some officer. The whole team was fighting for this piece of land, the position later renamed in honor of my late deputy Andriy Kizilo callsign \\\"Eagle\\\".\\n\\nBut the militants weren't giving up. They shelled Avdiyivka with \\\"Grad\\\" missiles and used heavy artillery. There was a time when the evacuation began, our forces were getting ready to retreat from the city ... But we put two tanks at the \\\"nines\\\" (nine-story buildings on the outskirts of the city), where journalists could take pictures of them. And so came news reports: \\\"Ukraine Army is ready for an offensive. There is no ceasefire deal.\\\" And the enemy abandoned their offensive plans. That's how we tricked them. We survived.\\n\\nWhat was the hardest moment for you back then?\\n\\nOnce I was called to the headquarters to get awards for my men. I took several dozen orders in Kyiv to take to the battalion. I called my chief of staff: \\\"Tomorrow I\\u2019m going to greet my men, so tell me who's where.\\\" I come to him next morning and several boxes with rewards are still on his table. I exploded: \\\"What the hell? Why didn\\u2019t you complete the task?\\\" He said, \\\"There is nobody to reward ... \\\" It turned out that some of them was killed and the rest were injured. At that moment I wish I were dead...\\n\\nThen a tough truce began. In the spring, three of our men were killed in mortar shelling. Then a direct hit to a dugout \\u2013 and another two KIAs. I almost lost it. I gave the order: \\\"Don't die\\\" and told them to make sure everyone heard that order...\\n\\nYou know what was my biggest reward? At the Eagle position we once came under mortar fire. A soldier was injured when he covered me from a fragment hit with his body. I yelled at him: \\\"What are you doing?\\\" He said, \\\"If you're killed, then we're all finished.\\\" Two times my soldiers covered me. I think there can be no better reward. All who participated in those fierce battles are heroes. Legends were born there that are now defending the country. I had the honor of commanding the best people.\\n\\nDid you talk with POWs then? And what did the militants say about you?\\n\\nThey [militants] loathed and feared us.\\n\\nWe were so bad we could launch 40 mines in response to a single gun burst in our direction. They were just waiting for us to go for a rotation. And when we were leaving, they didn't fire a single shot at us.\\n\\nI talked with prisoners in 2014-2017, and every year their faith in victory was becoming stronger and stronger. This is not the case with us. The war divided our country into two parts. The ATO or JFO is interesting to those who are in the ATO and to a small part of the country. The rest are weary. And in the news we hear all the time: \\\"A veteran killed someone\\\", \\\"A veteran is a suspect\\\", \\\" A grenade was found\\\", crap like that... And no one cares where you fought, how you fought, and if you have a PTSD\\u2026 Nobody tells anyone how we fought and how we survived. Right now we have a truce, but day after day there are new losses. It seems as if there are no battles but another sniper shot and there goes another \\\"200\\\" (KIA, killed in action).\\n\\nI wrote a book about how we fought, to let people know about the heroes\\u2026 I don't want to talk about what is happening now in the Army, I am an officer with the Armed Forces, my task is to defend the country and follow orders. But who is Lieutenant Colonel Vdovichenko now? One of the hundreds of lieutenant colonels. But who was battalion commander, lieutenant colonel Vdovichenko back then? A man followed by hundreds of best fighters, without hesitation, into fiercest battles. Something like this...\\n\\nMany times in Avdiyivka I wanted to die, I was looking for that death, but it never came by... But I reconsidered my life. A year ago, my wife gave me a son, my little Sasha! Now I want to live as long as possible. I have drawn conclusions. There are things that we can't change, we can only change our attitude towards them. I learned to let go of situations and people. Whoever's with me I'm glad to have them around, and whoever's not \\u2013 I'm not trying to change anyone and I don\\u2019t want to understand anyone. In one film, I heard: \\\"Everything always ends well.

There was a doctor in the second company, callsign \\\"Seagull\\\", a nice, positive guy. Shelling began at the Almaz position, and at some point, he took over command and managed things no worse than some officer. The whole team was fighting for this piece of land, the position later renamed in honor of my late deputy Andriy Kizilo callsign \\\"Eagle\\\".\\n\\nBut the militants weren't giving up. They shelled Avdiyivka with \\\"Grad\\\" missiles and used heavy artillery. There was a time when the evacuation began, our forces were getting ready to retreat from the city ... But we put two tanks at the \\\"nines\\\" (nine-story buildings on the outskirts of the city), where journalists could take pictures of them. And so came news reports: \\\"Ukraine Army is ready for an offensive. There is no ceasefire deal.\\\" And the enemy abandoned their offensive plans. That's how we tricked them. We survived.\\n\\nWhat was the hardest moment for you back then?\\n\\nOnce I was called to the headquarters to get awards for my men. I took several dozen orders in Kyiv to take to the battalion. I called my chief of staff: \\\"Tomorrow I\\u2019m going to greet my men, so tell me who's where.\\\" I come to him next morning and several boxes with rewards are still on his table. I exploded: \\\"What the hell? Why didn\\u2019t you complete the task?\\\" He said, \\\"There is nobody to reward ... \\\" It turned out that some of them was killed and the rest were injured. At that moment I wish I were dead...\\n\\nThen a tough truce began. In the spring, three of our men were killed in mortar shelling. Then a direct hit to a dugout \\u2013 and another two KIAs. I almost lost it. I gave the order: \\\"Don't die\\\" and told them to make sure everyone heard that order...\\n\\nYou know what was my biggest reward? At the Eagle position we once came under mortar fire. A soldier was injured when he covered me from a fragment hit with his body.

After such shelling in January 2015, local residents were left without heat, electricity, and water supplies for weeks.\\n\\nAt the beginning of 2016, battles for the industrial zone near Avdiyivka have intensified. Control over this \\\"gray zone\\\" allowed ensuring safety to the locals and gaining control of the Donetsk-Luhansk and Debaltseve-Horlivka motorways. Confrontation climaxed in the fall of that year and lasted until the spring of 2017. The enemy heavily engaged Ukrainian troops with weapons proscribed by the Minsk agreements. Several times the militants stormed the industrial zone, but their offensive efforts were repulsed, while Ukrainian forces advanced and gained better positions.\\n\\nIn those battles, the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade played a really important role, holding ground in Avdiyivka for 375 days and nights. Six fighters were awarded Bohdan Khmelnytsky orders (including one posthumously). The order of courage was awarded to 20 fighters (seven posthumously). Lieutenant Vasyl Tarasiuk and Captain Andriy Kizilo (posthumously) were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine.\\n\\nOleksandr Vdovichenko (call sign \\\"Slavian\\\"), a former battalion commander and now chief of staff with the 28th Brigade, told UNIAN how his fighters forced the militant grouping led by an infamous warlord Givi (who was later assassinated in Donetsk) to retreat, repelled the attacks of the \\\"elite\\\" DPR troops, and prevented an attack using photos of their tanks as a decoy, survived, and complied with their commander's order: \\\"Don't die!\\\"\\n\\nTell us about the first days at Avdiyivka's industrial zone.\\n\\nWe deployed in the Avdiyivka industrial zone in October 2016, and on the very first day, we came under enemy fire. Before that, we had not been involved in the ATO for six months, working with NATO instructors at a training ground, then we were held in reserve, based in the rear of Donetsk region. And my first thought in Avdiyivka was: \\\"I guess I'm going to die here.\\\"\\n\\nIt was really scary. First, we came under mortar fire. Everyone rushed into the basement and just waited. As we were moving along our positions, we came under machine gunfire. We ducked and lay there with our chief of recon, and after a few minutes I said to him: \\\"Actually, it's not scary anymore.\\\" And he went: \\u201cit's alright, you'll get used to it.\\\"\\n\\nAt that time, shelling never stopped. While artillery could be silent during daytime, automatic \\\"chatter\\\" did not subside, it was constant. When the first frost hit, the leaves fell from the trees and we were at the enemy's plain sight. There were no trenches at all. There were perhaps just two of them throughout the industrial zone. So we began to dig in order to survive.\\n\\nI will say that we were pretty well supplied at that time already. What we lacked was camouflage nets, thermal imagers, and generators ... But volunteers would bring this, too.\\n\\nWhen did the militants go for an offensive?\\n\\nThree days later, we changed positions and the airborne assault unit came in, and that's when I took command of the area and that very evening we got intercepted enemy communications. \\\"Sparrow\\\", the commander of the reconnaissance platoon of the Somali battalion, wrote to Givi: \\\"Man, we are in position, ready for the assault.\\\" The response was: \\\"Wait, let the artillery work a bit more.\\\" We could not understand where exactly they would strike ... But time passed, and from the forefront, our \\u201cRomeo\\u201d and \\u201cDragon\\u201d report: the enemy is around them. The enemy started to try and penetrate so we repelled their offensive with grenades.\\n\\nThen we had three of our men wounded. The enemy also suffered losses, but they were ready for this and did not retreat. In intercepted comms we heard Givi commands: \\\"Take them alive.\\\"\\n\\nI sent in a reserve group, but their artillery worked so hard that we could not approach those positions, we could not even get out of our command post. I just didn't know what to do. And then for the first time I gave the command to open fire at the enemy, practically next to our positions.There were basements, I drove everyone there and wrote to the commander of our mortar battery: \\\"Eugene, please, don\\u2019t hit our men\\u2026 \\\"And he dropped about forty mines on those bastards.\\n\\nThank God, we suffered no losses, while they had seven or eight KIAs. But Givi was only pumped up by those losses. He deployed the reserve and began to prepare for a new assault. And only after our artillery hit his command post and he was injured, he ordered to retreat.\\n\\nWe asked the JCCC (Joint Center for Monitoring and Coordinating Ceasefire and Stabilization of the Contact Line) to evacuate the wounded but they didn\\u2019t hear us...\\n\\nAnd how did further battles unfold?\\n\\nThe next day we reviewed the defense system and strengthened it. We planted more MON-50s (anti-personnel mines), stocked up on grenades and all we had at disposal. We realized that there is only one way out: it's either we or they. It became clear that if we didn't open fire, we would be dead. So we hit them with everything we had \\u2013 mortars, tanks, IFVs... The order to open fire was: \\\"Death to Novorossiya.\\\"\\n\\nDay after day, the industrial zone was practically bleeding, but we managed to stabilize the frontline in an incredible effort. At first we were in a semi-encirclement, but gradually we advanced along the flanks and deployed a \\u201chorseshoe\\u201d towards the enemy. Givi realized that he was finished so he retreated to be replaced by the \\\"Vostok Battalion\\\".\\n\\nWe survived. And we had no losses for a long time... But in three weeks we had one of our men killed.\\n\\nI tell everyone that I was in command of the best people. They could do everything. All of the \\u201cDPR\\u201d and the Russian Federation were against us. In February 2017, battles were ongoing from morning to night hours. Artillery fire never stopped. We once had no sleep in five days. It was freezing, but there was no trace of snow \\u2013 everything was black at our positions. Some say: \\\"The shell will not hit the same spot twice.\\\" Not true. It does, two, three, and four times. Everything was plowed. Everything was drenched in blood. And no one was originally going to fight like that for this piece of land. But after our guys were killed, it became a matter of principle.\\n\\nIt was like in those movies about Stalingrad. We would bring 16 men to the positions in the morning only to take them back out during the day. Volunteers also went to the positions: cooks, artillerymen, tankers. There was a doctor in the second company, callsign \\\"Seagull\\\", a nice, positive guy. Shelling began at the Almaz position, and at some point, he took over command and managed things no worse than some officer. The whole team was fighting for this piece of land, the position later renamed in honor of my late deputy Andriy Kizilo callsign \\\"Eagle\\\".\\n\\nBut the militants weren't giving up. They shelled Avdiyivka with \\\"Grad\\\" missiles and used heavy artillery. There was a time when the evacuation began, our forces were getting ready to retreat from the city ... But we put two tanks at the \\\"nines\\\" (nine-story buildings on the outskirts of the city), where journalists could take pictures of them. And so came news reports: \\\"Ukraine Army is ready for an offensive. There is no ceasefire deal.\\\" And the enemy abandoned their offensive plans. That's how we tricked them. We survived.\\n\\nWhat was the hardest moment for you back then?\\n\\nOnce I was called to the headquarters to get awards for my men. I took several dozen orders in Kyiv to take to the battalion. I called my chief of staff: \\\"Tomorrow I\\u2019m going to greet my men, so tell me who's where.\\\" I come to him next morning and several boxes with rewards are still on his table. I exploded: \\\"What the hell? Why didn\\u2019t you complete the task?\\\" He said, \\\"There is nobody to reward ... \\\" It turned out that some of them was killed and the rest were injured.

They were just waiting for us to go for a rotation. And when we were leaving, they didn't fire a single shot at us.\\n\\nI talked with prisoners in 2014-2017, and every year their faith in victory was becoming stronger and stronger. This is not the case with us. The war divided our country into two parts. The ATO or JFO is interesting to those who are in the ATO and to a small part of the country. The rest are weary.

After such shelling in January 2015, local residents were left without heat, electricity, and water supplies for weeks.\\n\\nAt the beginning of 2016, battles for the industrial zone near Avdiyivka have intensified. Control over this \\\"gray zone\\\" allowed ensuring safety to the locals and gaining control of the Donetsk-Luhansk and Debaltseve-Horlivka motorways. Confrontation climaxed in the fall of that year and lasted until the spring of 2017. The enemy heavily engaged Ukrainian troops with weapons proscribed by the Minsk agreements. Several times the militants stormed the industrial zone, but their offensive efforts were repulsed, while Ukrainian forces advanced and gained better positions.\\n\\nIn those battles, the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade played a really important role, holding ground in Avdiyivka for 375 days and nights. Six fighters were awarded Bohdan Khmelnytsky orders (including one posthumously). The order of courage was awarded to 20 fighters (seven posthumously). Lieutenant Vasyl Tarasiuk and Captain Andriy Kizilo (posthumously) were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine.\\n\\nOleksandr Vdovichenko (call sign \\\"Slavian\\\"), a former battalion commander and now chief of staff with the 28th Brigade, told UNIAN how his fighters forced the militant grouping led by an infamous warlord Givi (who was later assassinated in Donetsk) to retreat, repelled the attacks of the \\\"elite\\\" DPR troops, and prevented an attack using photos of their tanks as a decoy, survived, and complied with their commander's order: \\\"Don't die!\\\"\\n\\nTell us about the first days at Avdiyivka's industrial zone.\\n\\nWe deployed in the Avdiyivka industrial zone in October 2016, and on the very first day, we came under enemy fire. Before that, we had not been involved in the ATO for six months, working with NATO instructors at a training ground, then we were held in reserve, based in the rear of Donetsk region. And my first thought in Avdiyivka was: \\\"I guess I'm going to die here.\\\"\\n\\nIt was really scary. First, we came under mortar fire. Everyone rushed into the basement and just waited. As we were moving along our positions, we came under machine gunfire. We ducked and lay there with our chief of recon, and after a few minutes I said to him: \\\"Actually, it's not scary anymore.\\\" And he went: \\u201cit's alright, you'll get used to it.\\\"\\n\\nAt that time, shelling never stopped. While artillery could be silent during daytime, automatic \\\"chatter\\\" did not subside, it was constant. When the first frost hit, the leaves fell from the trees and we were at the enemy's plain sight. There were no trenches at all. There were perhaps just two of them throughout the industrial zone. So we began to dig in order to survive.\\n\\nI will say that we were pretty well supplied at that time already. What we lacked was camouflage nets, thermal imagers, and generators ... But volunteers would bring this, too.\\n\\nWhen did the militants go for an offensive?\\n\\nThree days later, we changed positions and the airborne assault unit came in, and that's when I took command of the area and that very evening we got intercepted enemy communications. \\\"Sparrow\\\", the commander of the reconnaissance platoon of the Somali battalion, wrote to Givi: \\\"Man, we are in position, ready for the assault.\\\" The response was: \\\"Wait, let the artillery work a bit more.\\\" We could not understand where exactly they would strike ... But time passed, and from the forefront, our \\u201cRomeo\\u201d and \\u201cDragon\\u201d report: the enemy is around them. The enemy started to try and penetrate so we repelled their offensive with grenades.\\n\\nThen we had three of our men wounded. The enemy also suffered losses, but they were ready for this and did not retreat. In intercepted comms we heard Givi commands: \\\"Take them alive.\\\"\\n\\nI sent in a reserve group, but their artillery worked so hard that we could not approach those positions, we could not even get out of our command post. I just didn't know what to do. And then for the first time I gave the command to open fire at the enemy, practically next to our positions.There were basements, I drove everyone there and wrote to the commander of our mortar battery: \\\"Eugene, please, don\\u2019t hit our men\\u2026 \\\"And he dropped about forty mines on those bastards.\\n\\nThank God, we suffered no losses, while they had seven or eight KIAs. But Givi was only pumped up by those losses. He deployed the reserve and began to prepare for a new assault. And only after our artillery hit his command post and he was injured, he ordered to retreat.\\n\\nWe asked the JCCC (Joint Center for Monitoring and Coordinating Ceasefire and Stabilization of the Contact Line) to evacuate the wounded but they didn\\u2019t hear us...\\n\\nAnd how did further battles unfold?\\n\\nThe next day we reviewed the defense system and strengthened it. We planted more MON-50s (anti-personnel mines), stocked up on grenades and all we had at disposal. We realized that there is only one way out: it's either we or they. It became clear that if we didn't open fire, we would be dead. So we hit them with everything we had \\u2013 mortars, tanks, IFVs... The order to open fire was: \\\"Death to Novorossiya.\\\"\\n\\nDay after day, the industrial zone was practically bleeding, but we managed to stabilize the frontline in an incredible effort. At first we were in a semi-encirclement, but gradually we advanced along the flanks and deployed a \\u201chorseshoe\\u201d towards the enemy. Givi realized that he was finished so he retreated to be replaced by the \\\"Vostok Battalion\\\".\\n\\nWe survived. And we had no losses for a long time... But in three weeks we had one of our men killed.\\n\\nI tell everyone that I was in command of the best people. They could do everything. All of the \\u201cDPR\\u201d and the Russian Federation were against us. In February 2017, battles were ongoing from morning to night hours. Artillery fire never stopped. We once had no sleep in five days. It was freezing, but there was no trace of snow \\u2013 everything was black at our positions. Some say: \\\"The shell will not hit the same spot twice.\\\" Not true. It does, two, three, and four times. Everything was plowed. Everything was drenched in blood. And no one was originally going to fight like that for this piece of land. But after our guys were killed, it became a matter of principle.\\n\\nIt was like in those movies about Stalingrad. We would bring 16 men to the positions in the morning only to take them back out during the day. Volunteers also went to the positions: cooks, artillerymen, tankers. There was a doctor in the second company, callsign \\\"Seagull\\\", a nice, positive guy. Shelling began at the Almaz position, and at some point, he took over command and managed things no worse than some officer. The whole team was fighting for this piece of land, the position later renamed in honor of my late deputy Andriy Kizilo callsign \\\"Eagle\\\".\\n\\nBut the militants weren't giving up. They shelled Avdiyivka with \\\"Grad\\\" missiles and used heavy artillery. There was a time when the evacuation began, our forces were getting ready to retreat from the city ... But we put two tanks at the \\\"nines\\\" (nine-story buildings on the outskirts of the city), where journalists could take pictures of them. And so came news reports: \\\"Ukraine Army is ready for an offensive. There is no ceasefire deal.\\\" And the enemy abandoned their offensive plans. That's how we tricked them. We survived.\\n\\nWhat was the hardest moment for you back then?\\n\\nOnce I was called to the headquarters to get awards for my men. I took several dozen orders in Kyiv to take to the battalion. I called my chief of staff: \\\"Tomorrow I\\u2019m going to greet my men, so tell me who's where.\\\" I come to him next morning and several boxes with rewards are still on his table. I exploded: \\\"What the hell? Why didn\\u2019t you complete the task?\\\" He said, \\\"There is nobody to reward ... \\\" It turned out that some of them was killed and the rest were injured. At that moment I wish I were dead...\\n\\nThen a tough truce began. In the spring, three of our men were killed in mortar shelling. Then a direct hit to a dugout \\u2013 and another two KIAs. I almost lost it. I gave the order: \\\"Don't die\\\" and told them to make sure everyone heard that order...\\n\\nYou know what was my biggest reward? At the Eagle position we once came under mortar fire. A soldier was injured when he covered me from a fragment hit with his body. I yelled at him: \\\"What are you doing?\\\" He said, \\\"If you're killed, then we're all finished.\\\" Two times my soldiers covered me. I think there can be no better reward. All who participated in those fierce battles are heroes. Legends were born there that are now defending the country. I had the honor of commanding the best people.\\n\\nDid you talk with POWs then? And what did the militants say about you?\\n\\nThey [militants] loathed and feared us.\\n\\nWe were so bad we could launch 40 mines in response to a single gun burst in our direction. They were just waiting for us to go for a rotation. And when we were leaving, they didn't fire a single shot at us.\\n\\nI talked with prisoners in 2014-2017, and every year their faith in victory was becoming stronger and stronger. This is not the case with us. The war divided our country into two parts. The ATO or JFO is interesting to those who are in the ATO and to a small part of the country. The rest are weary. And in the news we hear all the time: \\\"A veteran killed someone\\\", \\\"A veteran is a suspect\\\", \\\" A grenade was found\\\", crap like that... And no one cares where you fought, how you fought, and if you have a PTSD\\u2026 Nobody tells anyone how we fought and how we survived. Right now we have a truce, but day after day there are new losses. It seems as if there are no battles but another sniper shot and there goes another \\\"200\\\" (KIA, killed in action).\\n\\nI wrote a book about how we fought, to let people know about the heroes\\u2026 I don't want to talk about what is happening now in the Army, I am an officer with the Armed Forces, my task is to defend the country and follow orders. But who is Lieutenant Colonel Vdovichenko now? One of the hundreds of lieutenant colonels. But who was battalion commander, lieutenant colonel Vdovichenko back then? A man followed by hundreds of best fighters, without hesitation, into fiercest battles. Something like this...\\n\\nMany times in Avdiyivka I wanted to die, I was looking for that death, but it never came by... But I reconsidered my life. A year ago, my wife gave me a son, my little Sasha! Now I want to live as long as possible. I have drawn conclusions. There are things that we can't change, we can only change our attitude towards them. I learned to let go of situations and people. Whoever's with me I'm glad to have them around, and whoever's not \\u2013 I'm not trying to change anyone and I don\\u2019t want to understand anyone. In one film, I heard: \\\"Everything always ends well. If it ends badly, that's not the end yet.\\\"\", \"author\": \"\", \"url\": \"https://www.unian.info/war/10847180-former-battalion-commander-with-72nd-brigade-oleksandr-vdovichenko-my-first-thought-in-avdiyivka-was-i-guess-i-m-going-to-die-here.html\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 17:50:00 +0200\", \"published_utc\": 1580165400, \"collection_utc\": 1580171680}",News,1580165400
CrisisFACTS-010-News-190-0,CrisisFACTS-010,the rise of smart camera networks and why we should ban them that video cameras will use facial recognition software to track our every public move,"{\"id\": \"theintercept--2020-01-27--The Rise of Smart Camera Networks, and Why We Should Ban Them\", \"date\": \"2020-01-27\", \"source\": \"theintercept\", \"title\": \"The Rise of Smart Camera Networks, and Why We Should Ban Them\", \"content\": \"that video cameras will use facial recognition software to track our every public move. Far less remarked upon \\u2014 but every bit as alarming \\u2014 is the exponential expansion of \\u201csmart\\u201d video surveillance networks. Private businesses and homes are starting to plug their cameras into police networks, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence are investing closed-circuit television, or CCTV, networks with the power for total public surveillance. In the not-so-distant future, police forces, stores, and city administrators hope to film your every move \\u2014 and interpret it using video analytics. The rise of all-seeing smart camera networks is an alarming development that threatens civil rights and liberties throughout the world. Law enforcement agencies have a long history of using surveillance against marginalized communities, and studies show surveillance chills freedom of expression \\u2014 ill effects that could spread as camera networks grow larger and more sophisticated. To understand the situation we\\u2019re facing, we have to understand the rise of the video surveillance industrial complex \\u2014 its history, its power players, and its future trajectory. It begins with the proliferation of cameras for police and security, and ends with a powerful new industry imperative: complete visual surveillance of public space. In their first decades of existence, CCTV cameras were low-resolution analog devices that recorded onto tapes. Businesses or city authorities deployed them to film a small area of interest. Few cameras were placed in pubic, and the power to track people was limited: If police wanted to pursue a person of interest, they had to spend hours collecting footage by foot from nearby locations. In the late 1990s, video surveillance became more advanced. A company called Axis Communications invented the first internet-enabled surveillance camera, which converted moving images to digital data. New businesses like Milestone Systems built Video Management Systems, or VMS, to organize video information into databases. VMS providers created new features like motion sensor technology that alerted guards when a person was caught on camera in a restricted area. As time marched on, video surveillance spread. On one account, about 50 years ago, the United Kingdom had somewhere north of 60 permanent CCTV cameras installed nationwide. Today, the U.K. has over 6 million such devices, while the U.S. has tens of millions. According to marketing firm IHS Markit, 1 billion cameras will be watching the world by the end of 2021, with the United States rivaling China\\u2019s per person camera penetration rate. Police can now track people across multiple cameras from a command-and-control center, desktop, or smartphone. While it is possible to link thousands of cameras in a VMS, it is also expensive. To increase the amount of CCTVs available, cities recently came up with a clever hack: encouraging businesses and residents to place privately owned cameras on their police network \\u2014 what I call \\u201cplug-in surveillance networks.\\u201d\\n\\nBy pooling city-owned cameras with privately owned cameras, policing experts say an agency in a typical large city may amass hundreds of thousands of video feeds in just a few years. Detroit has popularized plug-in surveillance networks through its controversial Project Green Light program. With Project Green Light, businesses can purchase CCTV cameras and connect them to police headquarters. They can also place a bright green light next to the cameras to indicate they are part of the police network. The project claims to deter crime by signaling to residents: The police are watching you. Detroit is not alone. Chicago, New Orleans, New York, and Atlanta have also deployed plug-in surveillance networks. In these cities, private businesses and/or homes provide feeds that are integrated into crime centers so that police can access live streams and recorded footage. The police department in New Haven, Connecticut, told me they are looking into plug-in surveillance, and others are likely considering it. The number of cameras on police networks now range from tens of thousands (Chicago) to several hundred (New Orleans). With so many cameras in place, and only a small team of officers to watch them, law enforcement agencies face a new challenge: How do you make sense of all that footage? Around 2006, a young Israeli woman was recording family videos every weekend, but as a student and parent, she didn\\u2019t have time to watch them. A computer scientist at her university, Professor Shmuel Peleg, told me he tried to create a solution for her: He would take a long video and condense the interesting activity into a short video clip. His solution failed: It only worked on stationary cameras, and the student\\u2019s video camera was moving when she filmed her family. Peleg soon found another use case in the surveillance industry, which relies on stationary cameras. His solution became BriefCam, a video analytics firm that can summarize video footage from a scene across time so that investigators can view all relevant footage in a short space of time.\\n\\nUsing a feature called Video Synopsis, BriefCam overlays footage of events happening at different times as if they are appearing simultaneously. For example, if several people walked past a camera at 12:30 p.m., 12:40 p.m., and 12:50 p.m., BriefCam will aggregate their images into a single scene. Investigators can view all footage of interest from a given day in minutes instead of hours. Thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence, summarization is just one feature in BriefCam\\u2019s product line and the rapidly expanding video analytics industry. Behavior recognition includes video analytics capabilities like fight detection, emotion recognition, fall detection, loitering, dog walking, jaywalking, toll fare evasion, and even lie detection. Object recognition can recognize faces, animals, cars, weapons, fires, and other things, as well as human characteristics like gender, age, and hair color. Anomalous or unusual behavior detection works by recording a fixed area for a period of time \\u2014 say, 30 days \\u2014 and determining \\u201cnormal\\u201d behavior for that scene. If the camera sees something unusual \\u2014 say, a person running down a street at 3:00 a.m. \\u2014 it will flag the incident for attention. Video analytics systems can analyze and search across real-time streams or recorded footage. They can also isolate individuals or objects as they traverse a smart camera network. Chicago; New Orleans; Detroit; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Hartford, Connecticut, are some of the cities currently using BriefCam for policing. With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. This provides authorities the power to index and search a vast database of objects, behaviors, and anomalous activity. In Connecticut, police have used video analytics to identify or monitor known or suspected drug dealers. Sergeant Johnmichael O\\u2019Hare, former Director of the Hartford Real-Time Crime Center, recently demonstrated how BriefCam helped Hartford police reveal \\u201cwhere people go the most\\u201d in the space of 24 hours by viewing footage condensed and summarized in just nine minutes. Using a feature called \\u201cpathways,\\u201d he discovered hundreds of people visiting just two houses on the street and secured a search warrant to verify that they were drug houses. Video analytics startup Voxel51 is also adding more sophisticated searching to the mix. Co-founded by Jason Corso, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, the company offers a platform for video processing and understanding. Corso told me his company hopes to offer the first system where people can \\u201csearch based on semantic content about their data, such as, \\u2018I want to find all the video clips that have more than 3-way intersections \\u2026 with at least 20 vehicles during daylight.\\u2019\\u201d Voxel51 \\u201ctries to make that possible\\u201d by taking video footage and \\u201cturning it into structured searchable data across different types of platforms.\\u201d Unlike BriefCam, which analyzes video using nothing but its own software, Voxel51 offers an open platform which allows third parties to add their own analytics models. If the platform succeeds, it will supercharge the ability to search and surveil public spaces. Corso told me his company is working on a pilot project with the Baltimore police for their CitiWatch surveillance program and plans to trial the software with the Houston Police Department. As cities start deploying a wide range of monitoring devices from the so-called internet of things, researchers are also developing a technique known as video analytics and sensor fusion, or VA/SF, for police intelligence. With VA/SF, multiple streams from sensors are combined with video analytics to reduce uncertainties and make inferences about complex situations. As one example, Peleg told me BriefCam is developing in-camera audio analytics that uses microphones to discern actions that may confuse AI systems, such as whether people are fighting or dancing. VMSs also offer smart integration across technologies. Former New Haven Chief of Police Anthony Campbell told me how ShotSpotters, controversial devices that listen for gunshots, integrate with specialized software so when a gun is fired, nearby swivel cameras instantly alter their direction to the location of the weapons discharge. Officers can also use software to lock building doors from a control center, and companies are developing analytics to alert security if one car is being followed by another. Video analytics captures a wide variety of data about the areas covered by smart camera networks. Not surprisingly, the information captured is now being proposed for predictive policing: the use of data to predict and police crime before it happens. In 2002, the dystopian film \\u201cMinority Report\\u201d depicted a society using \\u201cpre-crime\\u201d analytics for police to intervene in lawbreaking before it occurs. In the end, the officers in charge tried to manipulate the system for their own interests. A real-world version of \\u201cMinority Report\\u201d is emerging through real-time crime centers used to analyze crime patterns for police. In these centers, law enforcement agencies ingest information from sources like social media networks, data brokers, public databases, criminal records, and ShotSpotters. Weather data is even included for its impact on crime (because \\u201cbad guys don\\u2019t like to get wet\\u201d). In a 2018 document, the data storage firm Western Digital and the consultancy Accenture predicted mass smart camera networks would be deployed \\u201cacross three tiers of maturity.\\u201d This multi-stage adoption, they contended, would \\u201callow society\\u201d to gradually abandon \\u201cconcerns about privacy\\u201d and instead \\u201caccept and advocate\\u201d for mass police and government surveillance in the interest of \\u201cpublic safety.\\u201d Tier 1 encompasses the present where police use CCTV networks to investigate crimes after-the-fact. By 2025, society will reach Tier 2 as municipalities transform into \\u201csmart\\u201d cities, the document said. Businesses and public institutions, like schools and hospitals, will plug camera feeds into government and law enforcement agencies to inform centralized, AI-enabled analytics systems. Tier 3, the most predictive-oriented surveillance system, will arrive by 2035. Some residents will voluntarily donate their camera feeds, while others will be \\u201cencouraged to do so by tax-break incentives or nominal compensation.\\u201d A \\u201cpublic safety ecosystem\\u201d will centralize data \\u201cpulled from disparate databases such as social media, driver\\u2019s licenses, police databases, and dark data.\\u201d An AI-enabled analytics unit will let police assess \\u201canomalies in real time and interrupt a crime before it is committed.\\u201d That is to say, to catch pre-crime. While CCTV surveillance began as a simple tool for criminal justice, it has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry that covers multiple industry verticals. From policing and smart cities to schools, health care facilities, and retail, society is moving toward near-complete visual surveillance of commercial and urban spaces. Denmark-based Milestone Systems, a top VMS provider with half its revenues in the U.S., had less than 10 employees in 1999. Today they are a major corporation that claims offices in over 20 countries. Axis Communications used to be a network printer outfit. They have since become a leading camera provider pushing over $1 billion in sales per year. BriefCam began as a university project. Now it is among the world\\u2019s top video analytics providers, with clients, it says, spanning over 40 countries. Over the past six years, Canon purchased all three, giving the imaging conglomerate ownership of industry giants in video management software, CCTV cameras, and video analytics. Motorola recently acquired a top VMS provider, Avigilon, for $1 billion. In turn, Avigilon and other large firms have purchased their own companies.\\n\\nFamiliar big tech giants are also in on the action. Lieutenant Patrick O\\u2019Donnell of the Chicago police force told me his department is working on a non-disclosure agreement with Google for a video analytics pilot project to detect people reacting to gunfire, and if they are in the prone position, so the police can receive real-time alerts. (Google did not respond to a request for comment.) Video monitoring networks inevitably entangle and implicate a whole ecosystem of vendors, some of whom have offered, or may yet offer, services specifically targeted at such systems. Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Comcast, Verizon, and Cisco are among those enabling the networks with technologies like cloud services, broadband connectivity, or video surveillance software. In the public sector, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is funding \\u201cpublic analytics\\u201d and communications networks like the First Responder Network Authority, or FirstNet, for real-time video and other surveillance technologies. FirstNet will cost $46.5 billion, and is being built by AT&T. Voxel51 is another NIST-backed venture. The public is thus paying for their own high-tech surveillance three times over: first, through taxes for university research; second, through grant money for the formation of a for-profit startup (Voxel51); and third, through the purchase of Voxel51\\u2019s services by city police departments using public funds. With the private and public sector looking to expand the presence of cameras, video surveillance has become a new cash cow. As Corso put it, \\u201cthere will be something like 45 billion cameras in the world within a few decades. That\\u2019s a lot of (video) pixels. For the most part, most of those pixels go unused.\\u201d Corso\\u2019s estimate mirrors a 2017 forecast from New York venture capital firm LDV, which believes smartphones will evolve to have even more cameras than they do today, contributing to the growth. Companies that began with markets for police and security are now diversifying their offerings to the commercial sector. BriefCam, Milestone, and Axis advertise the use of video analytics for retailers, where they can monitor foot traffic, queue length, shopping patterns, floor layouts, and conduct A/B testing. Voxel51 has an option built for the fashion industry and plans to expand across industry verticals. Motionloft offers analytics for smart cities, retailers, commercial real estate, and entertainment venues. Other examples abound. Public and private sector actors are pressing for a world full of smart video surveillance. Peleg, for example, told me of a use case for smart cities: If you drive into the city, you could \\u201cjust park and go home\\u201d without using a parking meter. The city would send a bill to your house at the end of the month. \\u201cOf course, you lose your privacy,\\u201d he added. \\u201cThe question is, do you really care about Big Brother knows where you are, what you do, etc.? Some people may not like it.\\u201d How to Rein in Smart Surveillance Those who do not like new forms of Big Brother surveillance are presently fixated on facial recognition. Yet they have largely ignored the shift to smart camera networks \\u2014 and the industrial complex driving it. Thousands of cameras are now set to scrutinize our every move, informing city authorities whether we are walking, running, riding a bike, or doing anything \\u201csuspicious.\\u201d With video analytics, artificial intelligence is used to identify our sex, age, and type of clothes, and could potentially be used to categorize us by race or religious attire. Such surveillance could have a severe chilling effect on our freedom of expression and association. Is this the world we want to live in? The capacity to track individuals across smart CCTV networks can be used to target marginalized communities. The detection of \\u201cloitering\\u201d or \\u201cshoplifting\\u201d by cameras concentrated in poor neighborhoods may deepen racial bias in policing practices. This kind of racial discrimination is already happening in South Africa, where \\u201cunusual behavior detection\\u201d has been deployed by smart camera networks for several years. In the United States, smart camera networks are just emerging, and there is little information or transparency about their use. Nevertheless, we know surveillance has been used throughout history to target oppressed groups. In recent years, the New York Police Department secretly spied on Muslims, the FBI used surveillance aircraft to monitor Black Lives Matter protesters, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection began building a high-tech video surveillance \\u201csmart border\\u201d across the Tohono O\\u2019odham reservation in Arizona. Law enforcement agencies claim smart camera networks will reduce crime, but at what cost? If a camera could be put in every room in every house, domestic violence might go down. We could add automated \\u201cfilters\\u201d that only record when a loud noise is detected, or when someone grabs a knife. Should police put smart cameras inside every living room? The commercial sector is likewise rationalizing the advance of surveillance capitalism into the physical domain. Retailers, employers, and investors want to put us all under smart video surveillance so they can manage us with visual \\u201cintelligence.\\u201d When asked about privacy, several major police departments told me they have the right to see and record everything you do as soon as you leave your home. Retailers, in turn, won\\u2019t even approach public disclosure: They are keeping their video analytics practices secret. In the United States, there is generally no \\u201creasonable expectation\\u201d of privacy in public. The Fourth Amendment encompasses the home and a few public areas we \\u201creasonably\\u201d expect to be private, such as a phone booth. Almost everything else \\u2014 our streets, our stores, our schools \\u2014 is fair game. Even if rules are updated to restrict the use of video surveillance, we cannot guarantee those rules will remain in place. With thousands of high-res cameras networked together, a dystopian surveillance state is a mouse click away. By installing cameras everywhere, we are opening a Pandora\\u2019s box. To address the privacy threats of smart camera networks, legislators should ban plug-in surveillance networks and restrict the scope of networked CCTVs beyond the premise of a single site. They should also limit the density of camera and sensor coverage in public. These measures would block the capacity to track people across wide areas and prevent the phenomenon of constantly being watched. The government should also ban video surveillance analytics in publicly accessible spaces, perhaps with exceptions for rare cases such as the detection of bodies on train tracks. Such a ban would disincentivize mass camera deployments because video analytics is needed to analyze large volumes of footage. Courts should urgently reconsider the scope of the Fourth Amendment and expand our right to privacy in public. Police departments, vendors, and researchers need to disclose and publicize their projects, and engage with academics, journalists, and civil society. It is clear we have a crisis in the works. We need to move beyond the limited conversation of facial recognition and address the broader world of video surveillance, before it is too late.\", \"author\": \"Michael Kwet\", \"url\": \"https://theintercept.com/2020/01/27/surveillance-cctv-smart-camera-networks/\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 17:53:01 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580165581, \"collection_utc\": 1580170790}",News,1580165581

Far less remarked upon \\u2014 but every bit as alarming \\u2014 is the exponential expansion of \\u201csmart\\u201d video surveillance networks. Private businesses and homes are starting to plug their cameras into police networks, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence are investing closed-circuit television, or CCTV, networks with the power for total public surveillance. In the not-so-distant future, police forces, stores, and city administrators hope to film your every move \\u2014 and interpret it using video analytics. The rise of all-seeing smart camera networks is an alarming development that threatens civil rights and liberties throughout the world. Law enforcement agencies have a long history of using surveillance against marginalized communities, and studies show surveillance chills freedom of expression \\u2014 ill effects that could spread as camera networks grow larger and more sophisticated. To understand the situation we\\u2019re facing, we have to understand the rise of the video surveillance industrial complex \\u2014 its history, its power players, and its future trajectory. It begins with the proliferation of cameras for police and security, and ends with a powerful new industry imperative: complete visual surveillance of public space. In their first decades of existence, CCTV cameras were low-resolution analog devices that recorded onto tapes. Businesses or city authorities deployed them to film a small area of interest. Few cameras were placed in pubic, and the power to track people was limited: If police wanted to pursue a person of interest, they had to spend hours collecting footage by foot from nearby locations. In the late 1990s, video surveillance became more advanced. A company called Axis Communications invented the first internet-enabled surveillance camera, which converted moving images to digital data. New businesses like Milestone Systems built Video Management Systems, or VMS, to organize video information into databases. VMS providers created new features like motion sensor technology that alerted guards when a person was caught on camera in a restricted area. As time marched on, video surveillance spread. On one account, about 50 years ago, the United Kingdom had somewhere north of 60 permanent CCTV cameras installed nationwide. Today, the U.K. has over 6 million such devices, while the U.S. has tens of millions. According to marketing firm IHS Markit, 1 billion cameras will be watching the world by the end of 2021, with the United States rivaling China\\u2019s per person camera penetration rate. Police can now track people across multiple cameras from a command-and-control center, desktop, or smartphone. While it is possible to link thousands of cameras in a VMS, it is also expensive. To increase the amount of CCTVs available, cities recently came up with a clever hack: encouraging businesses and residents to place privately owned cameras on their police network \\u2014 what I call \\u201cplug-in surveillance networks.\\u201d\\n\\nBy pooling city-owned cameras with privately owned cameras, policing experts say an agency in a typical large city may amass hundreds of thousands of video feeds in just a few years. Detroit has popularized plug-in surveillance networks through its controversial Project Green Light program. With Project Green Light, businesses can purchase CCTV cameras and connect them to police headquarters. They can also place a bright green light next to the cameras to indicate they are part of the police network. The project claims to deter crime by signaling to residents: The police are watching you. Detroit is not alone. Chicago, New Orleans, New York, and Atlanta have also deployed plug-in surveillance networks. In these cities, private businesses and/or homes provide feeds that are integrated into crime centers so that police can access live streams and recorded footage. The police department in New Haven, Connecticut, told me they are looking into plug-in surveillance, and others are likely considering it. The number of cameras on police networks now range from tens of thousands (Chicago) to several hundred (New Orleans). With so many cameras in place, and only a small team of officers to watch them, law enforcement agencies face a new challenge: How do you make sense of all that footage? Around 2006, a young Israeli woman was recording family videos every weekend, but as a student and parent, she didn\\u2019t have time to watch them. A computer scientist at her university, Professor Shmuel Peleg, told me he tried to create a solution for her: He would take a long video and condense the interesting activity into a short video clip. His solution failed: It only worked on stationary cameras, and the student\\u2019s video camera was moving when she filmed her family. Peleg soon found another use case in the surveillance industry, which relies on stationary cameras. His solution became BriefCam, a video analytics firm that can summarize video footage from a scene across time so that investigators can view all relevant footage in a short space of time.\\n\\nUsing a feature called Video Synopsis, BriefCam overlays footage of events happening at different times as if they are appearing simultaneously. For example, if several people walked past a camera at 12:30 p.m., 12:40 p.m., and 12:50 p.m., BriefCam will aggregate their images into a single scene. Investigators can view all footage of interest from a given day in minutes instead of hours. Thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence, summarization is just one feature in BriefCam\\u2019s product line and the rapidly expanding video analytics industry. Behavior recognition includes video analytics capabilities like fight detection, emotion recognition, fall detection, loitering, dog walking, jaywalking, toll fare evasion, and even lie detection. Object recognition can recognize faces, animals, cars, weapons, fires, and other things, as well as human characteristics like gender, age, and hair color. Anomalous or unusual behavior detection works by recording a fixed area for a period of time \\u2014 say, 30 days \\u2014 and determining \\u201cnormal\\u201d behavior for that scene. If the camera sees something unusual \\u2014 say, a person running down a street at 3:00 a.m. \\u2014 it will flag the incident for attention. Video analytics systems can analyze and search across real-time streams or recorded footage. They can also isolate individuals or objects as they traverse a smart camera network. Chicago; New Orleans; Detroit; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Hartford, Connecticut, are some of the cities currently using BriefCam for policing. With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. This provides authorities the power to index and search a vast database of objects, behaviors, and anomalous activity. In Connecticut, police have used video analytics to identify or monitor known or suspected drug dealers. Sergeant Johnmichael O\\u2019Hare, former Director of the Hartford Real-Time Crime Center, recently demonstrated how BriefCam helped Hartford police reveal \\u201cwhere people go the most\\u201d in the space of 24 hours by viewing footage condensed and summarized in just nine minutes. Using a feature called \\u201cpathways,\\u201d he discovered hundreds of people visiting just two houses on the street and secured a search warrant to verify that they were drug houses. Video analytics startup Voxel51 is also adding more sophisticated searching to the mix. Co-founded by Jason Corso, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, the company offers a platform for video processing and understanding. Corso told me his company hopes to offer the first system where people can \\u201csearch based on semantic content about their data, such as, \\u2018I want to find all the video clips that have more than 3-way intersections \\u2026 with at least 20 vehicles during daylight.\\u2019\\u201d Voxel51 \\u201ctries to make that possible\\u201d by taking video footage and \\u201cturning it into structured searchable data across different types of platforms.\\u201d Unlike BriefCam, which analyzes video using nothing but its own software, Voxel51 offers an open platform which allows third parties to add their own analytics models. If the platform succeeds, it will supercharge the ability to search and surveil public spaces. Corso told me his company is working on a pilot project with the Baltimore police for their CitiWatch surveillance program and plans to trial the software with the Houston Police Department. As cities start deploying a wide range of monitoring devices from the so-called internet of things, researchers are also developing a technique known as video analytics and sensor fusion, or VA/SF, for police intelligence. With VA/SF, multiple streams from sensors are combined with video analytics to reduce uncertainties and make inferences about complex situations. As one example, Peleg told me BriefCam is developing in-camera audio analytics that uses microphones to discern actions that may confuse AI systems, such as whether people are fighting or dancing. VMSs also offer smart integration across technologies. Former New Haven Chief of Police Anthony Campbell told me how ShotSpotters, controversial devices that listen for gunshots, integrate with specialized software so when a gun is fired, nearby swivel cameras instantly alter their direction to the location of the weapons discharge. Officers can also use software to lock building doors from a control center, and companies are developing analytics to alert security if one car is being followed by another. Video analytics captures a wide variety of data about the areas covered by smart camera networks. Not surprisingly, the information captured is now being proposed for predictive policing: the use of data to predict and police crime before it happens. In 2002, the dystopian film \\u201cMinority Report\\u201d depicted a society using \\u201cpre-crime\\u201d analytics for police to intervene in lawbreaking before it occurs. In the end, the officers in charge tried to manipulate the system for their own interests. A real-world version of \\u201cMinority Report\\u201d is emerging through real-time crime centers used to analyze crime patterns for police. In these centers, law enforcement agencies ingest information from sources like social media networks, data brokers, public databases, criminal records, and ShotSpotters. Weather data is even included for its impact on crime (because \\u201cbad guys don\\u2019t like to get wet\\u201d). In a 2018 document, the data storage firm Western Digital and the consultancy Accenture predicted mass smart camera networks would be deployed \\u201cacross three tiers of maturity.\\u201d This multi-stage adoption, they contended, would \\u201callow society\\u201d to gradually abandon \\u201cconcerns about privacy\\u201d and instead \\u201caccept and advocate\\u201d for mass police and government surveillance in the interest of \\u201cpublic safety.\\u201d Tier 1 encompasses the present where police use CCTV networks to investigate crimes after-the-fact. By 2025, society will reach Tier 2 as municipalities transform into \\u201csmart\\u201d cities, the document said. Businesses and public institutions, like schools and hospitals, will plug camera feeds into government and law enforcement agencies to inform centralized, AI-enabled analytics systems. Tier 3, the most predictive-oriented surveillance system, will arrive by 2035. Some residents will voluntarily donate their camera feeds, while others will be \\u201cencouraged to do so by tax-break incentives or nominal compensation.\\u201d A \\u201cpublic safety ecosystem\\u201d will centralize data \\u201cpulled from disparate databases such as social media, driver\\u2019s licenses, police databases, and dark data.\\u201d An AI-enabled analytics unit will let police assess \\u201canomalies in real time and interrupt a crime before it is committed.\\u201d That is to say, to catch pre-crime. While CCTV surveillance began as a simple tool for criminal justice, it has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry that covers multiple industry verticals. From policing and smart cities to schools, health care facilities, and retail, society is moving toward near-complete visual surveillance of commercial and urban spaces. Denmark-based Milestone Systems, a top VMS provider with half its revenues in the U.S., had less than 10 employees in 1999. Today they are a major corporation that claims offices in over 20 countries. Axis Communications used to be a network printer outfit. They have since become a leading camera provider pushing over $1 billion in sales per year. BriefCam began as a university project. Now it is among the world\\u2019s top video analytics providers, with clients, it says, spanning over 40 countries. Over the past six years, Canon purchased all three, giving the imaging conglomerate ownership of industry giants in video management software, CCTV cameras, and video analytics. Motorola recently acquired a top VMS provider, Avigilon, for $1 billion. In turn, Avigilon and other large firms have purchased their own companies.\\n\\nFamiliar big tech giants are also in on the action. Lieutenant Patrick O\\u2019Donnell of the Chicago police force told me his department is working on a non-disclosure agreement with Google for a video analytics pilot project to detect people reacting to gunfire, and if they are in the prone position, so the police can receive real-time alerts. (Google did not respond to a request for comment.) Video monitoring networks inevitably entangle and implicate a whole ecosystem of vendors, some of whom have offered, or may yet offer, services specifically targeted at such systems. Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Comcast, Verizon, and Cisco are among those enabling the networks with technologies like cloud services, broadband connectivity, or video surveillance software. In the public sector, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is funding \\u201cpublic analytics\\u201d and communications networks like the First Responder Network Authority, or FirstNet, for real-time video and other surveillance technologies. FirstNet will cost $46.5 billion, and is being built by AT&T. Voxel51 is another NIST-backed venture. The public is thus paying for their own high-tech surveillance three times over: first, through taxes for university research; second, through grant money for the formation of a for-profit startup (Voxel51); and third, through the purchase of Voxel51\\u2019s services by city police departments using public funds. With the private and public sector looking to expand the presence of cameras, video surveillance has become a new cash cow. As Corso put it, \\u201cthere will be something like 45 billion cameras in the world within a few decades. That\\u2019s a lot of (video) pixels. For the most part, most of those pixels go unused.\\u201d Corso\\u2019s estimate mirrors a 2017 forecast from New York venture capital firm LDV, which believes smartphones will evolve to have even more cameras than they do today, contributing to the growth. Companies that began with markets for police and security are now diversifying their offerings to the commercial sector. BriefCam, Milestone, and Axis advertise the use of video analytics for retailers, where they can monitor foot traffic, queue length, shopping patterns, floor layouts, and conduct A/B testing. Voxel51 has an option built for the fashion industry and plans to expand across industry verticals. Motionloft offers analytics for smart cities, retailers, commercial real estate, and entertainment venues. Other examples abound. Public and private sector actors are pressing for a world full of smart video surveillance. Peleg, for example, told me of a use case for smart cities: If you drive into the city, you could \\u201cjust park and go home\\u201d without using a parking meter. The city would send a bill to your house at the end of the month. \\u201cOf course, you lose your privacy,\\u201d he added. \\u201cThe question is, do you really care about Big Brother knows where you are, what you do, etc.? Some people may not like it.\\u201d How to Rein in Smart Surveillance Those who do not like new forms of Big Brother surveillance are presently fixated on facial recognition. Yet they have largely ignored the shift to smart camera networks \\u2014 and the industrial complex driving it. Thousands of cameras are now set to scrutinize our every move, informing city authorities whether we are walking, running, riding a bike, or doing anything \\u201csuspicious.\\u201d With video analytics, artificial intelligence is used to identify our sex, age, and type of clothes, and could potentially be used to categorize us by race or religious attire. Such surveillance could have a severe chilling effect on our freedom of expression and association. Is this the world we want to live in? The capacity to track individuals across smart CCTV networks can be used to target marginalized communities. The detection of \\u201cloitering\\u201d or \\u201cshoplifting\\u201d by cameras concentrated in poor neighborhoods may deepen racial bias in policing practices. This kind of racial discrimination is already happening in South Africa, where \\u201cunusual behavior detection\\u201d has been deployed by smart camera networks for several years. In the United States, smart camera networks are just emerging, and there is little information or transparency about their use. Nevertheless, we know surveillance has been used throughout history to target oppressed groups. In recent years, the New York Police Department secretly spied on Muslims, the FBI used surveillance aircraft to monitor Black Lives Matter protesters, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection began building a high-tech video surveillance \\u201csmart border\\u201d across the Tohono O\\u2019odham reservation in Arizona. Law enforcement agencies claim smart camera networks will reduce crime, but at what cost? If a camera could be put in every room in every house, domestic violence might go down. We could add automated \\u201cfilters\\u201d that only record when a loud noise is detected, or when someone grabs a knife. Should police put smart cameras inside every living room? The commercial sector is likewise rationalizing the advance of surveillance capitalism into the physical domain. Retailers, employers, and investors want to put us all under smart video surveillance so they can manage us with visual \\u201cintelligence.\\u201d When asked about privacy, several major police departments told me they have the right to see and record everything you do as soon as you leave your home. Retailers, in turn, won\\u2019t even approach public disclosure: They are keeping their video analytics practices secret. In the United States, there is generally no \\u201creasonable expectation\\u201d of privacy in public. The Fourth Amendment encompasses the home and a few public areas we \\u201creasonably\\u201d expect to be private, such as a phone booth. Almost everything else \\u2014 our streets, our stores, our schools \\u2014 is fair game. Even if rules are updated to restrict the use of video surveillance, we cannot guarantee those rules will remain in place. With thousands of high-res cameras networked together, a dystopian surveillance state is a mouse click away. By installing cameras everywhere, we are opening a Pandora\\u2019s box. To address the privacy threats of smart camera networks, legislators should ban plug-in surveillance networks and restrict the scope of networked CCTVs beyond the premise of a single site. They should also limit the density of camera and sensor coverage in public. These measures would block the capacity to track people across wide areas and prevent the phenomenon of constantly being watched.

Such a ban would disincentivize mass camera deployments because video analytics is needed to analyze large volumes of footage.

Some residents will voluntarily donate their camera feeds, while others will be \\u201cencouraged to do so by tax-break incentives or nominal compensation.\\u201d A \\u201cpublic safety ecosystem\\u201d will centralize data \\u201cpulled from disparate databases such as social media, driver\\u2019s licenses, police databases, and dark data.\\u201d An AI-enabled analytics unit will let police assess \\u201canomalies in real time and interrupt a crime before it is committed.\\u201d That is to say, to catch pre-crime. While CCTV surveillance began as a simple tool for criminal justice, it has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry that covers multiple industry verticals. From policing and smart cities to schools, health care facilities, and retail, society is moving toward near-complete visual surveillance of commercial and urban spaces. Denmark-based Milestone Systems, a top VMS provider with half its revenues in the U.S., had less than 10 employees in 1999. Today they are a major corporation that claims offices in over 20 countries. Axis Communications used to be a network printer outfit. They have since become a leading camera provider pushing over $1 billion in sales per year. BriefCam began as a university project. Now it is among the world\\u2019s top video analytics providers, with clients, it says, spanning over 40 countries. Over the past six years, Canon purchased all three, giving the imaging conglomerate ownership of industry giants in video management software, CCTV cameras, and video analytics. Motorola recently acquired a top VMS provider, Avigilon, for $1 billion. In turn, Avigilon and other large firms have purchased their own companies.\\n\\nFamiliar big tech giants are also in on the action. Lieutenant Patrick O\\u2019Donnell of the Chicago police force told me his department is working on a non-disclosure agreement with Google for a video analytics pilot project to detect people reacting to gunfire, and if they are in the prone position, so the police can receive real-time alerts. (Google did not respond to a request for comment.) Video monitoring networks inevitably entangle and implicate a whole ecosystem of vendors, some of whom have offered, or may yet offer, services specifically targeted at such systems. Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Comcast, Verizon, and Cisco are among those enabling the networks with technologies like cloud services, broadband connectivity, or video surveillance software. In the public sector, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is funding \\u201cpublic analytics\\u201d and communications networks like the First Responder Network Authority, or FirstNet, for real-time video and other surveillance technologies. FirstNet will cost $46.5 billion, and is being built by AT&T. Voxel51 is another NIST-backed venture. The public is thus paying for their own high-tech surveillance three times over: first, through taxes for university research; second, through grant money for the formation of a for-profit startup (Voxel51); and third, through the purchase of Voxel51\\u2019s services by city police departments using public funds. With the private and public sector looking to expand the presence of cameras, video surveillance has become a new cash cow. As Corso put it, \\u201cthere will be something like 45 billion cameras in the world within a few decades. That\\u2019s a lot of (video) pixels. For the most part, most of those pixels go unused.\\u201d Corso\\u2019s estimate mirrors a 2017 forecast from New York venture capital firm LDV, which believes smartphones will evolve to have even more cameras than they do today, contributing to the growth. Companies that began with markets for police and security are now diversifying their offerings to the commercial sector. BriefCam, Milestone, and Axis advertise the use of video analytics for retailers, where they can monitor foot traffic, queue length, shopping patterns, floor layouts, and conduct A/B testing. Voxel51 has an option built for the fashion industry and plans to expand across industry verticals. Motionloft offers analytics for smart cities, retailers, commercial real estate, and entertainment venues. Other examples abound. Public and private sector actors are pressing for a world full of smart video surveillance. Peleg, for example, told me of a use case for smart cities: If you drive into the city, you could \\u201cjust park and go home\\u201d without using a parking meter. The city would send a bill to your house at the end of the month. \\u201cOf course, you lose your privacy,\\u201d he added. \\u201cThe question is, do you really care about Big Brother knows where you are, what you do, etc.? Some people may not like it.\\u201d How to Rein in Smart Surveillance Those who do not like new forms of Big Brother surveillance are presently fixated on facial recognition. Yet they have largely ignored the shift to smart camera networks \\u2014 and the industrial complex driving it. Thousands of cameras are now set to scrutinize our every move, informing city authorities whether we are walking, running, riding a bike, or doing anything \\u201csuspicious.\\u201d With video analytics, artificial intelligence is used to identify our sex, age, and type of clothes, and could potentially be used to categorize us by race or religious attire. Such surveillance could have a severe chilling effect on our freedom of expression and association. Is this the world we want to live in? The capacity to track individuals across smart CCTV networks can be used to target marginalized communities. The detection of \\u201cloitering\\u201d or \\u201cshoplifting\\u201d by cameras concentrated in poor neighborhoods may deepen racial bias in policing practices. This kind of racial discrimination is already happening in South Africa, where \\u201cunusual behavior detection\\u201d has been deployed by smart camera networks for several years. In the United States, smart camera networks are just emerging, and there is little information or transparency about their use. Nevertheless, we know surveillance has been used throughout history to target oppressed groups. In recent years, the New York Police Department secretly spied on Muslims, the FBI used surveillance aircraft to monitor Black Lives Matter protesters, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection began building a high-tech video surveillance \\u201csmart border\\u201d across the Tohono O\\u2019odham reservation in Arizona. Law enforcement agencies claim smart camera networks will reduce crime, but at what cost? If a camera could be put in every room in every house, domestic violence might go down. We could add automated \\u201cfilters\\u201d that only record when a loud noise is detected, or when someone grabs a knife. Should police put smart cameras inside every living room? The commercial sector is likewise rationalizing the advance of surveillance capitalism into the physical domain. Retailers, employers, and investors want to put us all under smart video surveillance so they can manage us with visual \\u201cintelligence.\\u201d When asked about privacy, several major police departments told me they have the right to see and record everything you do as soon as you leave your home. Retailers, in turn, won\\u2019t even approach public disclosure: They are keeping their video analytics practices secret. In the United States, there is generally no \\u201creasonable expectation\\u201d of privacy in public. The Fourth Amendment encompasses the home and a few public areas we \\u201creasonably\\u201d expect to be private, such as a phone booth. Almost everything else \\u2014 our streets, our stores, our schools \\u2014 is fair game. Even if rules are updated to restrict the use of video surveillance, we cannot guarantee those rules will remain in place. With thousands of high-res cameras networked together, a dystopian surveillance state is a mouse click away. By installing cameras everywhere, we are opening a Pandora\\u2019s box. To address the privacy threats of smart camera networks, legislators should ban plug-in surveillance networks and restrict the scope of networked CCTVs beyond the premise of a single site. They should also limit the density of camera and sensor coverage in public. These measures would block the capacity to track people across wide areas and prevent the phenomenon of constantly being watched. The government should also ban video surveillance analytics in publicly accessible spaces, perhaps with exceptions for rare cases such as the detection of bodies on train tracks. Such a ban would disincentivize mass camera deployments because video analytics is needed to analyze large volumes of footage. Courts should urgently reconsider the scope of the Fourth Amendment and expand our right to privacy in public. Police departments, vendors, and researchers need to disclose and publicize their projects, and engage with academics, journalists, and civil society. It is clear we have a crisis in the works. We need to move beyond the limited conversation of facial recognition and address the broader world of video surveillance, before it is too late.\", \"author\": \"Michael Kwet\", \"url\": \"https://theintercept.com/2020/01/27/surveillance-cctv-smart-camera-networks/\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 17:53:01 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580165581, \"collection_utc\": 1580170790}",News,1580165581

Far less remarked upon \\u2014 but every bit as alarming \\u2014 is the exponential expansion of \\u201csmart\\u201d video surveillance networks. Private businesses and homes are starting to plug their cameras into police networks, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence are investing closed-circuit television, or CCTV, networks with the power for total public surveillance. In the not-so-distant future, police forces, stores, and city administrators hope to film your every move \\u2014 and interpret it using video analytics. The rise of all-seeing smart camera networks is an alarming development that threatens civil rights and liberties throughout the world. Law enforcement agencies have a long history of using surveillance against marginalized communities, and studies show surveillance chills freedom of expression \\u2014 ill effects that could spread as camera networks grow larger and more sophisticated. To understand the situation we\\u2019re facing, we have to understand the rise of the video surveillance industrial complex \\u2014 its history, its power players, and its future trajectory. It begins with the proliferation of cameras for police and security, and ends with a powerful new industry imperative: complete visual surveillance of public space. In their first decades of existence, CCTV cameras were low-resolution analog devices that recorded onto tapes. Businesses or city authorities deployed them to film a small area of interest. Few cameras were placed in pubic, and the power to track people was limited: If police wanted to pursue a person of interest, they had to spend hours collecting footage by foot from nearby locations. In the late 1990s, video surveillance became more advanced. A company called Axis Communications invented the first internet-enabled surveillance camera, which converted moving images to digital data. New businesses like Milestone Systems built Video Management Systems, or VMS, to organize video information into databases. VMS providers created new features like motion sensor technology that alerted guards when a person was caught on camera in a restricted area. As time marched on, video surveillance spread. On one account, about 50 years ago, the United Kingdom had somewhere north of 60 permanent CCTV cameras installed nationwide. Today, the U.K. has over 6 million such devices, while the U.S. has tens of millions. According to marketing firm IHS Markit, 1 billion cameras will be watching the world by the end of 2021, with the United States rivaling China\\u2019s per person camera penetration rate. Police can now track people across multiple cameras from a command-and-control center, desktop, or smartphone. While it is possible to link thousands of cameras in a VMS, it is also expensive. To increase the amount of CCTVs available, cities recently came up with a clever hack: encouraging businesses and residents to place privately owned cameras on their police network \\u2014 what I call \\u201cplug-in surveillance networks.\\u201d\\n\\nBy pooling city-owned cameras with privately owned cameras, policing experts say an agency in a typical large city may amass hundreds of thousands of video feeds in just a few years. Detroit has popularized plug-in surveillance networks through its controversial Project Green Light program. With Project Green Light, businesses can purchase CCTV cameras and connect them to police headquarters. They can also place a bright green light next to the cameras to indicate they are part of the police network. The project claims to deter crime by signaling to residents: The police are watching you. Detroit is not alone. Chicago, New Orleans, New York, and Atlanta have also deployed plug-in surveillance networks. In these cities, private businesses and/or homes provide feeds that are integrated into crime centers so that police can access live streams and recorded footage. The police department in New Haven, Connecticut, told me they are looking into plug-in surveillance, and others are likely considering it. The number of cameras on police networks now range from tens of thousands (Chicago) to several hundred (New Orleans). With so many cameras in place, and only a small team of officers to watch them, law enforcement agencies face a new challenge: How do you make sense of all that footage? Around 2006, a young Israeli woman was recording family videos every weekend, but as a student and parent, she didn\\u2019t have time to watch them. A computer scientist at her university, Professor Shmuel Peleg, told me he tried to create a solution for her: He would take a long video and condense the interesting activity into a short video clip. His solution failed: It only worked on stationary cameras, and the student\\u2019s video camera was moving when she filmed her family. Peleg soon found another use case in the surveillance industry, which relies on stationary cameras. His solution became BriefCam, a video analytics firm that can summarize video footage from a scene across time so that investigators can view all relevant footage in a short space of time.\\n\\nUsing a feature called Video Synopsis, BriefCam overlays footage of events happening at different times as if they are appearing simultaneously. For example, if several people walked past a camera at 12:30 p.m., 12:40 p.m., and 12:50 p.m., BriefCam will aggregate their images into a single scene. Investigators can view all footage of interest from a given day in minutes instead of hours. Thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence, summarization is just one feature in BriefCam\\u2019s product line and the rapidly expanding video analytics industry. Behavior recognition includes video analytics capabilities like fight detection, emotion recognition, fall detection, loitering, dog walking, jaywalking, toll fare evasion, and even lie detection. Object recognition can recognize faces, animals, cars, weapons, fires, and other things, as well as human characteristics like gender, age, and hair color. Anomalous or unusual behavior detection works by recording a fixed area for a period of time \\u2014 say, 30 days \\u2014 and determining \\u201cnormal\\u201d behavior for that scene. If the camera sees something unusual \\u2014 say, a person running down a street at 3:00 a.m. \\u2014 it will flag the incident for attention. Video analytics systems can analyze and search across real-time streams or recorded footage. They can also isolate individuals or objects as they traverse a smart camera network. Chicago; New Orleans; Detroit; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Hartford, Connecticut, are some of the cities currently using BriefCam for policing. With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. This provides authorities the power to index and search a vast database of objects, behaviors, and anomalous activity. In Connecticut, police have used video analytics to identify or monitor known or suspected drug dealers. Sergeant Johnmichael O\\u2019Hare, former Director of the Hartford Real-Time Crime Center, recently demonstrated how BriefCam helped Hartford police reveal \\u201cwhere people go the most\\u201d in the space of 24 hours by viewing footage condensed and summarized in just nine minutes. Using a feature called \\u201cpathways,\\u201d he discovered hundreds of people visiting just two houses on the street and secured a search warrant to verify that they were drug houses. Video analytics startup Voxel51 is also adding more sophisticated searching to the mix. Co-founded by Jason Corso, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, the company offers a platform for video processing and understanding. Corso told me his company hopes to offer the first system where people can \\u201csearch based on semantic content about their data, such as, \\u2018I want to find all the video clips that have more than 3-way intersections \\u2026 with at least 20 vehicles during daylight.\\u2019\\u201d Voxel51 \\u201ctries to make that possible\\u201d by taking video footage and \\u201cturning it into structured searchable data across different types of platforms.\\u201d Unlike BriefCam, which analyzes video using nothing but its own software, Voxel51 offers an open platform which allows third parties to add their own analytics models. If the platform succeeds, it will supercharge the ability to search and surveil public spaces. Corso told me his company is working on a pilot project with the Baltimore police for their CitiWatch surveillance program and plans to trial the software with the Houston Police Department. As cities start deploying a wide range of monitoring devices from the so-called internet of things, researchers are also developing a technique known as video analytics and sensor fusion, or VA/SF, for police intelligence. With VA/SF, multiple streams from sensors are combined with video analytics to reduce uncertainties and make inferences about complex situations. As one example, Peleg told me BriefCam is developing in-camera audio analytics that uses microphones to discern actions that may confuse AI systems, such as whether people are fighting or dancing. VMSs also offer smart integration across technologies. Former New Haven Chief of Police Anthony Campbell told me how ShotSpotters, controversial devices that listen for gunshots, integrate with specialized software so when a gun is fired, nearby swivel cameras instantly alter their direction to the location of the weapons discharge. Officers can also use software to lock building doors from a control center, and companies are developing analytics to alert security if one car is being followed by another. Video analytics captures a wide variety of data about the areas covered by smart camera networks. Not surprisingly, the information captured is now being proposed for predictive policing: the use of data to predict and police crime before it happens. In 2002, the dystopian film \\u201cMinority Report\\u201d depicted a society using \\u201cpre-crime\\u201d analytics for police to intervene in lawbreaking before it occurs. In the end, the officers in charge tried to manipulate the system for their own interests. A real-world version of \\u201cMinority Report\\u201d is emerging through real-time crime centers used to analyze crime patterns for police. In these centers, law enforcement agencies ingest information from sources like social media networks, data brokers, public databases, criminal records, and ShotSpotters. Weather data is even included for its impact on crime (because \\u201cbad guys don\\u2019t like to get wet\\u201d). In a 2018 document, the data storage firm Western Digital and the consultancy Accenture predicted mass smart camera networks would be deployed \\u201cacross three tiers of maturity.\\u201d This multi-stage adoption, they contended, would \\u201callow society\\u201d to gradually abandon \\u201cconcerns about privacy\\u201d and instead \\u201caccept and advocate\\u201d for mass police and government surveillance in the interest of \\u201cpublic safety.\\u201d Tier 1 encompasses the present where police use CCTV networks to investigate crimes after-the-fact. By 2025, society will reach Tier 2 as municipalities transform into \\u201csmart\\u201d cities, the document said. Businesses and public institutions, like schools and hospitals, will plug camera feeds into government and law enforcement agencies to inform centralized, AI-enabled analytics systems. Tier 3, the most predictive-oriented surveillance system, will arrive by 2035. Some residents will voluntarily donate their camera feeds, while others will be \\u201cencouraged to do so by tax-break incentives or nominal compensation.\\u201d A \\u201cpublic safety ecosystem\\u201d will centralize data \\u201cpulled from disparate databases such as social media, driver\\u2019s licenses, police databases, and dark data.\\u201d An AI-enabled analytics unit will let police assess \\u201canomalies in real time and interrupt a crime before it is committed.\\u201d That is to say, to catch pre-crime.

In these cities, private businesses and/or homes provide feeds that are integrated into crime centers so that police can access live streams and recorded footage. The police department in New Haven, Connecticut, told me they are looking into plug-in surveillance, and others are likely considering it. The number of cameras on police networks now range from tens of thousands (Chicago) to several hundred (New Orleans). With so many cameras in place, and only a small team of officers to watch them, law enforcement agencies face a new challenge: How do you make sense of all that footage? Around 2006, a young Israeli woman was recording family videos every weekend, but as a student and parent, she didn\\u2019t have time to watch them. A computer scientist at her university, Professor Shmuel Peleg, told me he tried to create a solution for her: He would take a long video and condense the interesting activity into a short video clip. His solution failed: It only worked on stationary cameras, and the student\\u2019s video camera was moving when she filmed her family. Peleg soon found another use case in the surveillance industry, which relies on stationary cameras. His solution became BriefCam, a video analytics firm that can summarize video footage from a scene across time so that investigators can view all relevant footage in a short space of time.\\n\\nUsing a feature called Video Synopsis, BriefCam overlays footage of events happening at different times as if they are appearing simultaneously. For example, if several people walked past a camera at 12:30 p.m., 12:40 p.m., and 12:50 p.m., BriefCam will aggregate their images into a single scene. Investigators can view all footage of interest from a given day in minutes instead of hours. Thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence, summarization is just one feature in BriefCam\\u2019s product line and the rapidly expanding video analytics industry. Behavior recognition includes video analytics capabilities like fight detection, emotion recognition, fall detection, loitering, dog walking, jaywalking, toll fare evasion, and even lie detection. Object recognition can recognize faces, animals, cars, weapons, fires, and other things, as well as human characteristics like gender, age, and hair color. Anomalous or unusual behavior detection works by recording a fixed area for a period of time \\u2014 say, 30 days \\u2014 and determining \\u201cnormal\\u201d behavior for that scene. If the camera sees something unusual \\u2014 say, a person running down a street at 3:00 a.m. \\u2014 it will flag the incident for attention. Video analytics systems can analyze and search across real-time streams or recorded footage. They can also isolate individuals or objects as they traverse a smart camera network. Chicago; New Orleans; Detroit; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Hartford, Connecticut, are some of the cities currently using BriefCam for policing. With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. This provides authorities the power to index and search a vast database of objects, behaviors, and anomalous activity. In Connecticut, police have used video analytics to identify or monitor known or suspected drug dealers. Sergeant Johnmichael O\\u2019Hare, former Director of the Hartford Real-Time Crime Center, recently demonstrated how BriefCam helped Hartford police reveal \\u201cwhere people go the most\\u201d in the space of 24 hours by viewing footage condensed and summarized in just nine minutes. Using a feature called \\u201cpathways,\\u201d he discovered hundreds of people visiting just two houses on the street and secured a search warrant to verify that they were drug houses. Video analytics startup Voxel51 is also adding more sophisticated searching to the mix. Co-founded by Jason Corso, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, the company offers a platform for video processing and understanding. Corso told me his company hopes to offer the first system where people can \\u201csearch based on semantic content about their data, such as, \\u2018I want to find all the video clips that have more than 3-way intersections \\u2026 with at least 20 vehicles during daylight.\\u2019\\u201d Voxel51 \\u201ctries to make that possible\\u201d by taking video footage and \\u201cturning it into structured searchable data across different types of platforms.\\u201d Unlike BriefCam, which analyzes video using nothing but its own software, Voxel51 offers an open platform which allows third parties to add their own analytics models. If the platform succeeds, it will supercharge the ability to search and surveil public spaces. Corso told me his company is working on a pilot project with the Baltimore police for their CitiWatch surveillance program and plans to trial the software with the Houston Police Department. As cities start deploying a wide range of monitoring devices from the so-called internet of things, researchers are also developing a technique known as video analytics and sensor fusion, or VA/SF, for police intelligence. With VA/SF, multiple streams from sensors are combined with video analytics to reduce uncertainties and make inferences about complex situations. As one example, Peleg told me BriefCam is developing in-camera audio analytics that uses microphones to discern actions that may confuse AI systems, such as whether people are fighting or dancing. VMSs also offer smart integration across technologies. Former New Haven Chief of Police Anthony Campbell told me how ShotSpotters, controversial devices that listen for gunshots, integrate with specialized software so when a gun is fired, nearby swivel cameras instantly alter their direction to the location of the weapons discharge. Officers can also use software to lock building doors from a control center, and companies are developing analytics to alert security if one car is being followed by another. Video analytics captures a wide variety of data about the areas covered by smart camera networks. Not surprisingly, the information captured is now being proposed for predictive policing: the use of data to predict and police crime before it happens. In 2002, the dystopian film \\u201cMinority Report\\u201d depicted a society using \\u201cpre-crime\\u201d analytics for police to intervene in lawbreaking before it occurs. In the end, the officers in charge tried to manipulate the system for their own interests. A real-world version of \\u201cMinority Report\\u201d is emerging through real-time crime centers used to analyze crime patterns for police. In these centers, law enforcement agencies ingest information from sources like social media networks, data brokers, public databases, criminal records, and ShotSpotters. Weather data is even included for its impact on crime (because \\u201cbad guys don\\u2019t like to get wet\\u201d). In a 2018 document, the data storage firm Western Digital and the consultancy Accenture predicted mass smart camera networks would be deployed \\u201cacross three tiers of maturity.\\u201d This multi-stage adoption, they contended, would \\u201callow society\\u201d to gradually abandon \\u201cconcerns about privacy\\u201d and instead \\u201caccept and advocate\\u201d for mass police and government surveillance in the interest of \\u201cpublic safety.\\u201d Tier 1 encompasses the present where police use CCTV networks to investigate crimes after-the-fact. By 2025, society will reach Tier 2 as municipalities transform into \\u201csmart\\u201d cities, the document said. Businesses and public institutions, like schools and hospitals, will plug camera feeds into government and law enforcement agencies to inform centralized, AI-enabled analytics systems. Tier 3, the most predictive-oriented surveillance system, will arrive by 2035. Some residents will voluntarily donate their camera feeds, while others will be \\u201cencouraged to do so by tax-break incentives or nominal compensation.\\u201d A \\u201cpublic safety ecosystem\\u201d will centralize data \\u201cpulled from disparate databases such as social media, driver\\u2019s licenses, police databases, and dark data.\\u201d An AI-enabled analytics unit will let police assess \\u201canomalies in real time and interrupt a crime before it is committed.\\u201d That is to say, to catch pre-crime. While CCTV surveillance began as a simple tool for criminal justice, it has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry that covers multiple industry verticals. From policing and smart cities to schools, health care facilities, and retail, society is moving toward near-complete visual surveillance of commercial and urban spaces. Denmark-based Milestone Systems, a top VMS provider with half its revenues in the U.S., had less than 10 employees in 1999. Today they are a major corporation that claims offices in over 20 countries. Axis Communications used to be a network printer outfit. They have since become a leading camera provider pushing over $1 billion in sales per year. BriefCam began as a university project. Now it is among the world\\u2019s top video analytics providers, with clients, it says, spanning over 40 countries. Over the past six years, Canon purchased all three, giving the imaging conglomerate ownership of industry giants in video management software, CCTV cameras, and video analytics. Motorola recently acquired a top VMS provider, Avigilon, for $1 billion. In turn, Avigilon and other large firms have purchased their own companies.\\n\\nFamiliar big tech giants are also in on the action. Lieutenant Patrick O\\u2019Donnell of the Chicago police force told me his department is working on a non-disclosure agreement with Google for a video analytics pilot project to detect people reacting to gunfire, and if they are in the prone position, so the police can receive real-time alerts. (Google did not respond to a request for comment.) Video monitoring networks inevitably entangle and implicate a whole ecosystem of vendors, some of whom have offered, or may yet offer, services specifically targeted at such systems. Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Comcast, Verizon, and Cisco are among those enabling the networks with technologies like cloud services, broadband connectivity, or video surveillance software. In the public sector, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is funding \\u201cpublic analytics\\u201d and communications networks like the First Responder Network Authority, or FirstNet, for real-time video and other surveillance technologies. FirstNet will cost $46.5 billion, and is being built by AT&T. Voxel51 is another NIST-backed venture. The public is thus paying for their own high-tech surveillance three times over: first, through taxes for university research; second, through grant money for the formation of a for-profit startup (Voxel51); and third, through the purchase of Voxel51\\u2019s services by city police departments using public funds. With the private and public sector looking to expand the presence of cameras, video surveillance has become a new cash cow. As Corso put it, \\u201cthere will be something like 45 billion cameras in the world within a few decades. That\\u2019s a lot of (video) pixels. For the most part, most of those pixels go unused.\\u201d Corso\\u2019s estimate mirrors a 2017 forecast from New York venture capital firm LDV, which believes smartphones will evolve to have even more cameras than they do today, contributing to the growth. Companies that began with markets for police and security are now diversifying their offerings to the commercial sector. BriefCam, Milestone, and Axis advertise the use of video analytics for retailers, where they can monitor foot traffic, queue length, shopping patterns, floor layouts, and conduct A/B testing. Voxel51 has an option built for the fashion industry and plans to expand across industry verticals. Motionloft offers analytics for smart cities, retailers, commercial real estate, and entertainment venues. Other examples abound. Public and private sector actors are pressing for a world full of smart video surveillance. Peleg, for example, told me of a use case for smart cities: If you drive into the city, you could \\u201cjust park and go home\\u201d without using a parking meter. The city would send a bill to your house at the end of the month. \\u201cOf course, you lose your privacy,\\u201d he added. \\u201cThe question is, do you really care about Big Brother knows where you are, what you do, etc.? Some people may not like it.\\u201d How to Rein in Smart Surveillance Those who do not like new forms of Big Brother surveillance are presently fixated on facial recognition. Yet they have largely ignored the shift to smart camera networks \\u2014 and the industrial complex driving it. Thousands of cameras are now set to scrutinize our every move, informing city authorities whether we are walking, running, riding a bike, or doing anything \\u201csuspicious.\\u201d With video analytics, artificial intelligence is used to identify our sex, age, and type of clothes, and could potentially be used to categorize us by race or religious attire. Such surveillance could have a severe chilling effect on our freedom of expression and association. Is this the world we want to live in? The capacity to track individuals across smart CCTV networks can be used to target marginalized communities. The detection of \\u201cloitering\\u201d or \\u201cshoplifting\\u201d by cameras concentrated in poor neighborhoods may deepen racial bias in policing practices. This kind of racial discrimination is already happening in South Africa, where \\u201cunusual behavior detection\\u201d has been deployed by smart camera networks for several years. In the United States, smart camera networks are just emerging, and there is little information or transparency about their use. Nevertheless, we know surveillance has been used throughout history to target oppressed groups. In recent years, the New York Police Department secretly spied on Muslims, the FBI used surveillance aircraft to monitor Black Lives Matter protesters, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection began building a high-tech video surveillance \\u201csmart border\\u201d across the Tohono O\\u2019odham reservation in Arizona. Law enforcement agencies claim smart camera networks will reduce crime, but at what cost? If a camera could be put in every room in every house, domestic violence might go down. We could add automated \\u201cfilters\\u201d that only record when a loud noise is detected, or when someone grabs a knife. Should police put smart cameras inside every living room? The commercial sector is likewise rationalizing the advance of surveillance capitalism into the physical domain. Retailers, employers, and investors want to put us all under smart video surveillance so they can manage us with visual \\u201cintelligence.\\u201d When asked about privacy, several major police departments told me they have the right to see and record everything you do as soon as you leave your home. Retailers, in turn, won\\u2019t even approach public disclosure: They are keeping their video analytics practices secret. In the United States, there is generally no \\u201creasonable expectation\\u201d of privacy in public. The Fourth Amendment encompasses the home and a few public areas we \\u201creasonably\\u201d expect to be private, such as a phone booth. Almost everything else \\u2014 our streets, our stores, our schools \\u2014 is fair game. Even if rules are updated to restrict the use of video surveillance, we cannot guarantee those rules will remain in place. With thousands of high-res cameras networked together, a dystopian surveillance state is a mouse click away. By installing cameras everywhere, we are opening a Pandora\\u2019s box. To address the privacy threats of smart camera networks, legislators should ban plug-in surveillance networks and restrict the scope of networked CCTVs beyond the premise of a single site. They should also limit the density of camera and sensor coverage in public. These measures would block the capacity to track people across wide areas and prevent the phenomenon of constantly being watched. The government should also ban video surveillance analytics in publicly accessible spaces, perhaps with exceptions for rare cases such as the detection of bodies on train tracks. Such a ban would disincentivize mass camera deployments because video analytics is needed to analyze large volumes of footage. Courts should urgently reconsider the scope of the Fourth Amendment and expand our right to privacy in public. Police departments, vendors, and researchers need to disclose and publicize their projects, and engage with academics, journalists, and civil society. It is clear we have a crisis in the works. We need to move beyond the limited conversation of facial recognition and address the broader world of video surveillance, before it is too late.\", \"author\": \"Michael Kwet\", \"url\": \"https://theintercept.com/2020/01/27/surveillance-cctv-smart-camera-networks/\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 17:53:01 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580165581, \"collection_utc\": 1580170790}",News,1580165581

Far less remarked upon \\u2014 but every bit as alarming \\u2014 is the exponential expansion of \\u201csmart\\u201d video surveillance networks. Private businesses and homes are starting to plug their cameras into police networks, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence are investing closed-circuit television, or CCTV, networks with the power for total public surveillance. In the not-so-distant future, police forces, stores, and city administrators hope to film your every move \\u2014 and interpret it using video analytics. The rise of all-seeing smart camera networks is an alarming development that threatens civil rights and liberties throughout the world. Law enforcement agencies have a long history of using surveillance against marginalized communities, and studies show surveillance chills freedom of expression \\u2014 ill effects that could spread as camera networks grow larger and more sophisticated. To understand the situation we\\u2019re facing, we have to understand the rise of the video surveillance industrial complex \\u2014 its history, its power players, and its future trajectory. It begins with the proliferation of cameras for police and security, and ends with a powerful new industry imperative: complete visual surveillance of public space. In their first decades of existence, CCTV cameras were low-resolution analog devices that recorded onto tapes. Businesses or city authorities deployed them to film a small area of interest. Few cameras were placed in pubic, and the power to track people was limited: If police wanted to pursue a person of interest, they had to spend hours collecting footage by foot from nearby locations. In the late 1990s, video surveillance became more advanced. A company called Axis Communications invented the first internet-enabled surveillance camera, which converted moving images to digital data. New businesses like Milestone Systems built Video Management Systems, or VMS, to organize video information into databases. VMS providers created new features like motion sensor technology that alerted guards when a person was caught on camera in a restricted area. As time marched on, video surveillance spread. On one account, about 50 years ago, the United Kingdom had somewhere north of 60 permanent CCTV cameras installed nationwide. Today, the U.K. has over 6 million such devices, while the U.S. has tens of millions. According to marketing firm IHS Markit, 1 billion cameras will be watching the world by the end of 2021, with the United States rivaling China\\u2019s per person camera penetration rate. Police can now track people across multiple cameras from a command-and-control center, desktop, or smartphone. While it is possible to link thousands of cameras in a VMS, it is also expensive. To increase the amount of CCTVs available, cities recently came up with a clever hack: encouraging businesses and residents to place privately owned cameras on their police network \\u2014 what I call \\u201cplug-in surveillance networks.\\u201d\\n\\nBy pooling city-owned cameras with privately owned cameras, policing experts say an agency in a typical large city may amass hundreds of thousands of video feeds in just a few years. Detroit has popularized plug-in surveillance networks through its controversial Project Green Light program. With Project Green Light, businesses can purchase CCTV cameras and connect them to police headquarters. They can also place a bright green light next to the cameras to indicate they are part of the police network. The project claims to deter crime by signaling to residents: The police are watching you. Detroit is not alone. Chicago, New Orleans, New York, and Atlanta have also deployed plug-in surveillance networks. In these cities, private businesses and/or homes provide feeds that are integrated into crime centers so that police can access live streams and recorded footage. The police department in New Haven, Connecticut, told me they are looking into plug-in surveillance, and others are likely considering it. The number of cameras on police networks now range from tens of thousands (Chicago) to several hundred (New Orleans). With so many cameras in place, and only a small team of officers to watch them, law enforcement agencies face a new challenge: How do you make sense of all that footage? Around 2006, a young Israeli woman was recording family videos every weekend, but as a student and parent, she didn\\u2019t have time to watch them.

The detection of \\u201cloitering\\u201d or \\u201cshoplifting\\u201d by cameras concentrated in poor neighborhoods may deepen racial bias in policing practices. This kind of racial discrimination is already happening in South Africa, where \\u201cunusual behavior detection\\u201d has been deployed by smart camera networks for several years. In the United States, smart camera networks are just emerging, and there is little information or transparency about their use. Nevertheless, we know surveillance has been used throughout history to target oppressed groups. In recent years, the New York Police Department secretly spied on Muslims, the FBI used surveillance aircraft to monitor Black Lives Matter protesters, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection began building a high-tech video surveillance \\u201csmart border\\u201d across the Tohono O\\u2019odham reservation in Arizona. Law enforcement agencies claim smart camera networks will reduce crime, but at what cost? If a camera could be put in every room in every house, domestic violence might go down. We could add automated \\u201cfilters\\u201d that only record when a loud noise is detected, or when someone grabs a knife. Should police put smart cameras inside every living room? The commercial sector is likewise rationalizing the advance of surveillance capitalism into the physical domain. Retailers, employers, and investors want to put us all under smart video surveillance so they can manage us with visual \\u201cintelligence.\\u201d When asked about privacy, several major police departments told me they have the right to see and record everything you do as soon as you leave your home. Retailers, in turn, won\\u2019t even approach public disclosure: They are keeping their video analytics practices secret. In the United States, there is generally no \\u201creasonable expectation\\u201d of privacy in public. The Fourth Amendment encompasses the home and a few public areas we \\u201creasonably\\u201d expect to be private, such as a phone booth. Almost everything else \\u2014 our streets, our stores, our schools \\u2014 is fair game. Even if rules are updated to restrict the use of video surveillance, we cannot guarantee those rules will remain in place. With thousands of high-res cameras networked together, a dystopian surveillance state is a mouse click away. By installing cameras everywhere, we are opening a Pandora\\u2019s box. To address the privacy threats of smart camera networks, legislators should ban plug-in surveillance networks and restrict the scope of networked CCTVs beyond the premise of a single site. They should also limit the density of camera and sensor coverage in public. These measures would block the capacity to track people across wide areas and prevent the phenomenon of constantly being watched. The government should also ban video surveillance analytics in publicly accessible spaces, perhaps with exceptions for rare cases such as the detection of bodies on train tracks. Such a ban would disincentivize mass camera deployments because video analytics is needed to analyze large volumes of footage. Courts should urgently reconsider the scope of the Fourth Amendment and expand our right to privacy in public. Police departments, vendors, and researchers need to disclose and publicize their projects, and engage with academics, journalists, and civil society. It is clear we have a crisis in the works. We need to move beyond the limited conversation of facial recognition and address the broader world of video surveillance, before it is too late.\", \"author\": \"Michael Kwet\", \"url\": \"https://theintercept.com/2020/01/27/surveillance-cctv-smart-camera-networks/\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 17:53:01 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580165581, \"collection_utc\": 1580170790}",News,1580165581

Far less remarked upon \\u2014 but every bit as alarming \\u2014 is the exponential expansion of \\u201csmart\\u201d video surveillance networks. Private businesses and homes are starting to plug their cameras into police networks, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence are investing closed-circuit television, or CCTV, networks with the power for total public surveillance. In the not-so-distant future, police forces, stores, and city administrators hope to film your every move \\u2014 and interpret it using video analytics. The rise of all-seeing smart camera networks is an alarming development that threatens civil rights and liberties throughout the world. Law enforcement agencies have a long history of using surveillance against marginalized communities, and studies show surveillance chills freedom of expression \\u2014 ill effects that could spread as camera networks grow larger and more sophisticated. To understand the situation we\\u2019re facing, we have to understand the rise of the video surveillance industrial complex \\u2014 its history, its power players, and its future trajectory. It begins with the proliferation of cameras for police and security, and ends with a powerful new industry imperative: complete visual surveillance of public space. In their first decades of existence, CCTV cameras were low-resolution analog devices that recorded onto tapes. Businesses or city authorities deployed them to film a small area of interest. Few cameras were placed in pubic, and the power to track people was limited: If police wanted to pursue a person of interest, they had to spend hours collecting footage by foot from nearby locations. In the late 1990s, video surveillance became more advanced. A company called Axis Communications invented the first internet-enabled surveillance camera, which converted moving images to digital data. New businesses like Milestone Systems built Video Management Systems, or VMS, to organize video information into databases. VMS providers created new features like motion sensor technology that alerted guards when a person was caught on camera in a restricted area. As time marched on, video surveillance spread. On one account, about 50 years ago, the United Kingdom had somewhere north of 60 permanent CCTV cameras installed nationwide. Today, the U.K. has over 6 million such devices, while the U.S. has tens of millions. According to marketing firm IHS Markit, 1 billion cameras will be watching the world by the end of 2021, with the United States rivaling China\\u2019s per person camera penetration rate. Police can now track people across multiple cameras from a command-and-control center, desktop, or smartphone. While it is possible to link thousands of cameras in a VMS, it is also expensive. To increase the amount of CCTVs available, cities recently came up with a clever hack: encouraging businesses and residents to place privately owned cameras on their police network \\u2014 what I call \\u201cplug-in surveillance networks.\\u201d\\n\\nBy pooling city-owned cameras with privately owned cameras, policing experts say an agency in a typical large city may amass hundreds of thousands of video feeds in just a few years. Detroit has popularized plug-in surveillance networks through its controversial Project Green Light program. With Project Green Light, businesses can purchase CCTV cameras and connect them to police headquarters. They can also place a bright green light next to the cameras to indicate they are part of the police network. The project claims to deter crime by signaling to residents: The police are watching you. Detroit is not alone. Chicago, New Orleans, New York, and Atlanta have also deployed plug-in surveillance networks. In these cities, private businesses and/or homes provide feeds that are integrated into crime centers so that police can access live streams and recorded footage. The police department in New Haven, Connecticut, told me they are looking into plug-in surveillance, and others are likely considering it. The number of cameras on police networks now range from tens of thousands (Chicago) to several hundred (New Orleans). With so many cameras in place, and only a small team of officers to watch them, law enforcement agencies face a new challenge: How do you make sense of all that footage? Around 2006, a young Israeli woman was recording family videos every weekend, but as a student and parent, she didn\\u2019t have time to watch them. A computer scientist at her university, Professor Shmuel Peleg, told me he tried to create a solution for her: He would take a long video and condense the interesting activity into a short video clip. His solution failed: It only worked on stationary cameras, and the student\\u2019s video camera was moving when she filmed her family. Peleg soon found another use case in the surveillance industry, which relies on stationary cameras. His solution became BriefCam, a video analytics firm that can summarize video footage from a scene across time so that investigators can view all relevant footage in a short space of time.\\n\\nUsing a feature called Video Synopsis, BriefCam overlays footage of events happening at different times as if they are appearing simultaneously. For example, if several people walked past a camera at 12:30 p.m., 12:40 p.m., and 12:50 p.m., BriefCam will aggregate their images into a single scene. Investigators can view all footage of interest from a given day in minutes instead of hours. Thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence, summarization is just one feature in BriefCam\\u2019s product line and the rapidly expanding video analytics industry. Behavior recognition includes video analytics capabilities like fight detection, emotion recognition, fall detection, loitering, dog walking, jaywalking, toll fare evasion, and even lie detection. Object recognition can recognize faces, animals, cars, weapons, fires, and other things, as well as human characteristics like gender, age, and hair color. Anomalous or unusual behavior detection works by recording a fixed area for a period of time \\u2014 say, 30 days \\u2014 and determining \\u201cnormal\\u201d behavior for that scene. If the camera sees something unusual \\u2014 say, a person running down a street at 3:00 a.m. \\u2014 it will flag the incident for attention. Video analytics systems can analyze and search across real-time streams or recorded footage. They can also isolate individuals or objects as they traverse a smart camera network. Chicago; New Orleans; Detroit; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Hartford, Connecticut, are some of the cities currently using BriefCam for policing. With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. This provides authorities the power to index and search a vast database of objects, behaviors, and anomalous activity. In Connecticut, police have used video analytics to identify or monitor known or suspected drug dealers. Sergeant Johnmichael O\\u2019Hare, former Director of the Hartford Real-Time Crime Center, recently demonstrated how BriefCam helped Hartford police reveal \\u201cwhere people go the most\\u201d in the space of 24 hours by viewing footage condensed and summarized in just nine minutes. Using a feature called \\u201cpathways,\\u201d he discovered hundreds of people visiting just two houses on the street and secured a search warrant to verify that they were drug houses. Video analytics startup Voxel51 is also adding more sophisticated searching to the mix. Co-founded by Jason Corso, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, the company offers a platform for video processing and understanding. Corso told me his company hopes to offer the first system where people can \\u201csearch based on semantic content about their data, such as, \\u2018I want to find all the video clips that have more than 3-way intersections \\u2026 with at least 20 vehicles during daylight.\\u2019\\u201d Voxel51 \\u201ctries to make that possible\\u201d by taking video footage and \\u201cturning it into structured searchable data across different types of platforms.\\u201d Unlike BriefCam, which analyzes video using nothing but its own software, Voxel51 offers an open platform which allows third parties to add their own analytics models. If the platform succeeds, it will supercharge the ability to search and surveil public spaces. Corso told me his company is working on a pilot project with the Baltimore police for their CitiWatch surveillance program and plans to trial the software with the Houston Police Department. As cities start deploying a wide range of monitoring devices from the so-called internet of things, researchers are also developing a technique known as video analytics and sensor fusion, or VA/SF, for police intelligence. With VA/SF, multiple streams from sensors are combined with video analytics to reduce uncertainties and make inferences about complex situations. As one example, Peleg told me BriefCam is developing in-camera audio analytics that uses microphones to discern actions that may confuse AI systems, such as whether people are fighting or dancing. VMSs also offer smart integration across technologies. Former New Haven Chief of Police Anthony Campbell told me how ShotSpotters, controversial devices that listen for gunshots, integrate with specialized software so when a gun is fired, nearby swivel cameras instantly alter their direction to the location of the weapons discharge. Officers can also use software to lock building doors from a control center, and companies are developing analytics to alert security if one car is being followed by another. Video analytics captures a wide variety of data about the areas covered by smart camera networks. Not surprisingly, the information captured is now being proposed for predictive policing: the use of data to predict and police crime before it happens. In 2002, the dystopian film \\u201cMinority Report\\u201d depicted a society using \\u201cpre-crime\\u201d analytics for police to intervene in lawbreaking before it occurs. In the end, the officers in charge tried to manipulate the system for their own interests. A real-world version of \\u201cMinority Report\\u201d is emerging through real-time crime centers used to analyze crime patterns for police. In these centers, law enforcement agencies ingest information from sources like social media networks, data brokers, public databases, criminal records, and ShotSpotters. Weather data is even included for its impact on crime (because \\u201cbad guys don\\u2019t like to get wet\\u201d). In a 2018 document, the data storage firm Western Digital and the consultancy Accenture predicted mass smart camera networks would be deployed \\u201cacross three tiers of maturity.\\u201d This multi-stage adoption, they contended, would \\u201callow society\\u201d to gradually abandon \\u201cconcerns about privacy\\u201d and instead \\u201caccept and advocate\\u201d for mass police and government surveillance in the interest of \\u201cpublic safety.\\u201d Tier 1 encompasses the present where police use CCTV networks to investigate crimes after-the-fact. By 2025, society will reach Tier 2 as municipalities transform into \\u201csmart\\u201d cities, the document said. Businesses and public institutions, like schools and hospitals, will plug camera feeds into government and law enforcement agencies to inform centralized, AI-enabled analytics systems. Tier 3, the most predictive-oriented surveillance system, will arrive by 2035. Some residents will voluntarily donate their camera feeds, while others will be \\u201cencouraged to do so by tax-break incentives or nominal compensation.\\u201d A \\u201cpublic safety ecosystem\\u201d will centralize data \\u201cpulled from disparate databases such as social media, driver\\u2019s licenses, police databases, and dark data.\\u201d An AI-enabled analytics unit will let police assess \\u201canomalies in real time and interrupt a crime before it is committed.\\u201d That is to say, to catch pre-crime. While CCTV surveillance began as a simple tool for criminal justice, it has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry that covers multiple industry verticals. From policing and smart cities to schools, health care facilities, and retail, society is moving toward near-complete visual surveillance of commercial and urban spaces. Denmark-based Milestone Systems, a top VMS provider with half its revenues in the U.S., had less than 10 employees in 1999. Today they are a major corporation that claims offices in over 20 countries. Axis Communications used to be a network printer outfit. They have since become a leading camera provider pushing over $1 billion in sales per year. BriefCam began as a university project. Now it is among the world\\u2019s top video analytics providers, with clients, it says, spanning over 40 countries. Over the past six years, Canon purchased all three, giving the imaging conglomerate ownership of industry giants in video management software, CCTV cameras, and video analytics. Motorola recently acquired a top VMS provider, Avigilon, for $1 billion. In turn, Avigilon and other large firms have purchased their own companies.\\n\\nFamiliar big tech giants are also in on the action. Lieutenant Patrick O\\u2019Donnell of the Chicago police force told me his department is working on a non-disclosure agreement with Google for a video analytics pilot project to detect people reacting to gunfire, and if they are in the prone position, so the police can receive real-time alerts. (Google did not respond to a request for comment.) Video monitoring networks inevitably entangle and implicate a whole ecosystem of vendors, some of whom have offered, or may yet offer, services specifically targeted at such systems. Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Comcast, Verizon, and Cisco are among those enabling the networks with technologies like cloud services, broadband connectivity, or video surveillance software. In the public sector, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is funding \\u201cpublic analytics\\u201d and communications networks like the First Responder Network Authority, or FirstNet, for real-time video and other surveillance technologies. FirstNet will cost $46.5 billion, and is being built by AT&T. Voxel51 is another NIST-backed venture. The public is thus paying for their own high-tech surveillance three times over: first, through taxes for university research; second, through grant money for the formation of a for-profit startup (Voxel51); and third, through the purchase of Voxel51\\u2019s services by city police departments using public funds. With the private and public sector looking to expand the presence of cameras, video surveillance has become a new cash cow. As Corso put it, \\u201cthere will be something like 45 billion cameras in the world within a few decades. That\\u2019s a lot of (video) pixels. For the most part, most of those pixels go unused.\\u201d Corso\\u2019s estimate mirrors a 2017 forecast from New York venture capital firm LDV, which believes smartphones will evolve to have even more cameras than they do today, contributing to the growth. Companies that began with markets for police and security are now diversifying their offerings to the commercial sector. BriefCam, Milestone, and Axis advertise the use of video analytics for retailers, where they can monitor foot traffic, queue length, shopping patterns, floor layouts, and conduct A/B testing. Voxel51 has an option built for the fashion industry and plans to expand across industry verticals. Motionloft offers analytics for smart cities, retailers, commercial real estate, and entertainment venues. Other examples abound. Public and private sector actors are pressing for a world full of smart video surveillance. Peleg, for example, told me of a use case for smart cities: If you drive into the city, you could \\u201cjust park and go home\\u201d without using a parking meter. The city would send a bill to your house at the end of the month. \\u201cOf course, you lose your privacy,\\u201d he added. \\u201cThe question is, do you really care about Big Brother knows where you are, what you do, etc.? Some people may not like it.\\u201d How to Rein in Smart Surveillance Those who do not like new forms of Big Brother surveillance are presently fixated on facial recognition. Yet they have largely ignored the shift to smart camera networks \\u2014 and the industrial complex driving it. Thousands of cameras are now set to scrutinize our every move, informing city authorities whether we are walking, running, riding a bike, or doing anything \\u201csuspicious.\\u201d With video analytics, artificial intelligence is used to identify our sex, age, and type of clothes, and could potentially be used to categorize us by race or religious attire. Such surveillance could have a severe chilling effect on our freedom of expression and association. Is this the world we want to live in? The capacity to track individuals across smart CCTV networks can be used to target marginalized communities. The detection of \\u201cloitering\\u201d or \\u201cshoplifting\\u201d by cameras concentrated in poor neighborhoods may deepen racial bias in policing practices. This kind of racial discrimination is already happening in South Africa, where \\u201cunusual behavior detection\\u201d has been deployed by smart camera networks for several years. In the United States, smart camera networks are just emerging, and there is little information or transparency about their use. Nevertheless, we know surveillance has been used throughout history to target oppressed groups. In recent years, the New York Police Department secretly spied on Muslims, the FBI used surveillance aircraft to monitor Black Lives Matter protesters, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection began building a high-tech video surveillance \\u201csmart border\\u201d across the Tohono O\\u2019odham reservation in Arizona. Law enforcement agencies claim smart camera networks will reduce crime, but at what cost? If a camera could be put in every room in every house, domestic violence might go down. We could add automated \\u201cfilters\\u201d that only record when a loud noise is detected, or when someone grabs a knife. Should police put smart cameras inside every living room? The commercial sector is likewise rationalizing the advance of surveillance capitalism into the physical domain. Retailers, employers, and investors want to put us all under smart video surveillance so they can manage us with visual \\u201cintelligence.\\u201d When asked about privacy, several major police departments told me they have the right to see and record everything you do as soon as you leave your home. Retailers, in turn, won\\u2019t even approach public disclosure: They are keeping their video analytics practices secret. In the United States, there is generally no \\u201creasonable expectation\\u201d of privacy in public. The Fourth Amendment encompasses the home and a few public areas we \\u201creasonably\\u201d expect to be private, such as a phone booth. Almost everything else \\u2014 our streets, our stores, our schools \\u2014 is fair game. Even if rules are updated to restrict the use of video surveillance, we cannot guarantee those rules will remain in place. With thousands of high-res cameras networked together, a dystopian surveillance state is a mouse click away. By installing cameras everywhere, we are opening a Pandora\\u2019s box.

Former New Haven Chief of Police Anthony Campbell told me how ShotSpotters, controversial devices that listen for gunshots, integrate with specialized software so when a gun is fired, nearby swivel cameras instantly alter their direction to the location of the weapons discharge. Officers can also use software to lock building doors from a control center, and companies are developing analytics to alert security if one car is being followed by another. Video analytics captures a wide variety of data about the areas covered by smart camera networks. Not surprisingly, the information captured is now being proposed for predictive policing: the use of data to predict and police crime before it happens. In 2002, the dystopian film \\u201cMinority Report\\u201d depicted a society using \\u201cpre-crime\\u201d analytics for police to intervene in lawbreaking before it occurs. In the end, the officers in charge tried to manipulate the system for their own interests. A real-world version of \\u201cMinority Report\\u201d is emerging through real-time crime centers used to analyze crime patterns for police. In these centers, law enforcement agencies ingest information from sources like social media networks, data brokers, public databases, criminal records, and ShotSpotters. Weather data is even included for its impact on crime (because \\u201cbad guys don\\u2019t like to get wet\\u201d). In a 2018 document, the data storage firm Western Digital and the consultancy Accenture predicted mass smart camera networks would be deployed \\u201cacross three tiers of maturity.\\u201d This multi-stage adoption, they contended, would \\u201callow society\\u201d to gradually abandon \\u201cconcerns about privacy\\u201d and instead \\u201caccept and advocate\\u201d for mass police and government surveillance in the interest of \\u201cpublic safety.\\u201d Tier 1 encompasses the present where police use CCTV networks to investigate crimes after-the-fact. By 2025, society will reach Tier 2 as municipalities transform into \\u201csmart\\u201d cities, the document said. Businesses and public institutions, like schools and hospitals, will plug camera feeds into government and law enforcement agencies to inform centralized, AI-enabled analytics systems. Tier 3, the most predictive-oriented surveillance system, will arrive by 2035. Some residents will voluntarily donate their camera feeds, while others will be \\u201cencouraged to do so by tax-break incentives or nominal compensation.\\u201d A \\u201cpublic safety ecosystem\\u201d will centralize data \\u201cpulled from disparate databases such as social media, driver\\u2019s licenses, police databases, and dark data.\\u201d An AI-enabled analytics unit will let police assess \\u201canomalies in real time and interrupt a crime before it is committed.\\u201d That is to say, to catch pre-crime. While CCTV surveillance began as a simple tool for criminal justice, it has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry that covers multiple industry verticals. From policing and smart cities to schools, health care facilities, and retail, society is moving toward near-complete visual surveillance of commercial and urban spaces. Denmark-based Milestone Systems, a top VMS provider with half its revenues in the U.S., had less than 10 employees in 1999. Today they are a major corporation that claims offices in over 20 countries. Axis Communications used to be a network printer outfit. They have since become a leading camera provider pushing over $1 billion in sales per year. BriefCam began as a university project. Now it is among the world\\u2019s top video analytics providers, with clients, it says, spanning over 40 countries. Over the past six years, Canon purchased all three, giving the imaging conglomerate ownership of industry giants in video management software, CCTV cameras, and video analytics. Motorola recently acquired a top VMS provider, Avigilon, for $1 billion. In turn, Avigilon and other large firms have purchased their own companies.\\n\\nFamiliar big tech giants are also in on the action. Lieutenant Patrick O\\u2019Donnell of the Chicago police force told me his department is working on a non-disclosure agreement with Google for a video analytics pilot project to detect people reacting to gunfire, and if they are in the prone position, so the police can receive real-time alerts. (Google did not respond to a request for comment.) Video monitoring networks inevitably entangle and implicate a whole ecosystem of vendors, some of whom have offered, or may yet offer, services specifically targeted at such systems. Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Comcast, Verizon, and Cisco are among those enabling the networks with technologies like cloud services, broadband connectivity, or video surveillance software. In the public sector, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is funding \\u201cpublic analytics\\u201d and communications networks like the First Responder Network Authority, or FirstNet, for real-time video and other surveillance technologies. FirstNet will cost $46.5 billion, and is being built by AT&T. Voxel51 is another NIST-backed venture. The public is thus paying for their own high-tech surveillance three times over: first, through taxes for university research; second, through grant money for the formation of a for-profit startup (Voxel51); and third, through the purchase of Voxel51\\u2019s services by city police departments using public funds. With the private and public sector looking to expand the presence of cameras, video surveillance has become a new cash cow. As Corso put it, \\u201cthere will be something like 45 billion cameras in the world within a few decades. That\\u2019s a lot of (video) pixels. For the most part, most of those pixels go unused.\\u201d Corso\\u2019s estimate mirrors a 2017 forecast from New York venture capital firm LDV, which believes smartphones will evolve to have even more cameras than they do today, contributing to the growth. Companies that began with markets for police and security are now diversifying their offerings to the commercial sector. BriefCam, Milestone, and Axis advertise the use of video analytics for retailers, where they can monitor foot traffic, queue length, shopping patterns, floor layouts, and conduct A/B testing. Voxel51 has an option built for the fashion industry and plans to expand across industry verticals. Motionloft offers analytics for smart cities, retailers, commercial real estate, and entertainment venues. Other examples abound. Public and private sector actors are pressing for a world full of smart video surveillance. Peleg, for example, told me of a use case for smart cities: If you drive into the city, you could \\u201cjust park and go home\\u201d without using a parking meter. The city would send a bill to your house at the end of the month. \\u201cOf course, you lose your privacy,\\u201d he added. \\u201cThe question is, do you really care about Big Brother knows where you are, what you do, etc.? Some people may not like it.\\u201d How to Rein in Smart Surveillance Those who do not like new forms of Big Brother surveillance are presently fixated on facial recognition. Yet they have largely ignored the shift to smart camera networks \\u2014 and the industrial complex driving it. Thousands of cameras are now set to scrutinize our every move, informing city authorities whether we are walking, running, riding a bike, or doing anything \\u201csuspicious.\\u201d With video analytics, artificial intelligence is used to identify our sex, age, and type of clothes, and could potentially be used to categorize us by race or religious attire. Such surveillance could have a severe chilling effect on our freedom of expression and association. Is this the world we want to live in? The capacity to track individuals across smart CCTV networks can be used to target marginalized communities. The detection of \\u201cloitering\\u201d or \\u201cshoplifting\\u201d by cameras concentrated in poor neighborhoods may deepen racial bias in policing practices. This kind of racial discrimination is already happening in South Africa, where \\u201cunusual behavior detection\\u201d has been deployed by smart camera networks for several years. In the United States, smart camera networks are just emerging, and there is little information or transparency about their use. Nevertheless, we know surveillance has been used throughout history to target oppressed groups. In recent years, the New York Police Department secretly spied on Muslims, the FBI used surveillance aircraft to monitor Black Lives Matter protesters, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection began building a high-tech video surveillance \\u201csmart border\\u201d across the Tohono O\\u2019odham reservation in Arizona. Law enforcement agencies claim smart camera networks will reduce crime, but at what cost? If a camera could be put in every room in every house, domestic violence might go down. We could add automated \\u201cfilters\\u201d that only record when a loud noise is detected, or when someone grabs a knife. Should police put smart cameras inside every living room? The commercial sector is likewise rationalizing the advance of surveillance capitalism into the physical domain. Retailers, employers, and investors want to put us all under smart video surveillance so they can manage us with visual \\u201cintelligence.\\u201d When asked about privacy, several major police departments told me they have the right to see and record everything you do as soon as you leave your home. Retailers, in turn, won\\u2019t even approach public disclosure: They are keeping their video analytics practices secret. In the United States, there is generally no \\u201creasonable expectation\\u201d of privacy in public. The Fourth Amendment encompasses the home and a few public areas we \\u201creasonably\\u201d expect to be private, such as a phone booth. Almost everything else \\u2014 our streets, our stores, our schools \\u2014 is fair game. Even if rules are updated to restrict the use of video surveillance, we cannot guarantee those rules will remain in place. With thousands of high-res cameras networked together, a dystopian surveillance state is a mouse click away. By installing cameras everywhere, we are opening a Pandora\\u2019s box. To address the privacy threats of smart camera networks, legislators should ban plug-in surveillance networks and restrict the scope of networked CCTVs beyond the premise of a single site. They should also limit the density of camera and sensor coverage in public. These measures would block the capacity to track people across wide areas and prevent the phenomenon of constantly being watched. The government should also ban video surveillance analytics in publicly accessible spaces, perhaps with exceptions for rare cases such as the detection of bodies on train tracks. Such a ban would disincentivize mass camera deployments because video analytics is needed to analyze large volumes of footage. Courts should urgently reconsider the scope of the Fourth Amendment and expand our right to privacy in public. Police departments, vendors, and researchers need to disclose and publicize their projects, and engage with academics, journalists, and civil society. It is clear we have a crisis in the works. We need to move beyond the limited conversation of facial recognition and address the broader world of video surveillance, before it is too late.\", \"author\": \"Michael Kwet\", \"url\": \"https://theintercept.com/2020/01/27/surveillance-cctv-smart-camera-networks/\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 17:53:01 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580165581, \"collection_utc\": 1580170790}",News,1580165581

Far less remarked upon \\u2014 but every bit as alarming \\u2014 is the exponential expansion of \\u201csmart\\u201d video surveillance networks. Private businesses and homes are starting to plug their cameras into police networks, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence are investing closed-circuit television, or CCTV, networks with the power for total public surveillance. In the not-so-distant future, police forces, stores, and city administrators hope to film your every move \\u2014 and interpret it using video analytics. The rise of all-seeing smart camera networks is an alarming development that threatens civil rights and liberties throughout the world. Law enforcement agencies have a long history of using surveillance against marginalized communities, and studies show surveillance chills freedom of expression \\u2014 ill effects that could spread as camera networks grow larger and more sophisticated. To understand the situation we\\u2019re facing, we have to understand the rise of the video surveillance industrial complex \\u2014 its history, its power players, and its future trajectory. It begins with the proliferation of cameras for police and security, and ends with a powerful new industry imperative: complete visual surveillance of public space. In their first decades of existence, CCTV cameras were low-resolution analog devices that recorded onto tapes. Businesses or city authorities deployed them to film a small area of interest. Few cameras were placed in pubic, and the power to track people was limited: If police wanted to pursue a person of interest, they had to spend hours collecting footage by foot from nearby locations. In the late 1990s, video surveillance became more advanced. A company called Axis Communications invented the first internet-enabled surveillance camera, which converted moving images to digital data. New businesses like Milestone Systems built Video Management Systems, or VMS, to organize video information into databases. VMS providers created new features like motion sensor technology that alerted guards when a person was caught on camera in a restricted area. As time marched on, video surveillance spread. On one account, about 50 years ago, the United Kingdom had somewhere north of 60 permanent CCTV cameras installed nationwide. Today, the U.K. has over 6 million such devices, while the U.S. has tens of millions. According to marketing firm IHS Markit, 1 billion cameras will be watching the world by the end of 2021, with the United States rivaling China\\u2019s per person camera penetration rate. Police can now track people across multiple cameras from a command-and-control center, desktop, or smartphone. While it is possible to link thousands of cameras in a VMS, it is also expensive. To increase the amount of CCTVs available, cities recently came up with a clever hack: encouraging businesses and residents to place privately owned cameras on their police network \\u2014 what I call \\u201cplug-in surveillance networks.\\u201d\\n\\nBy pooling city-owned cameras with privately owned cameras, policing experts say an agency in a typical large city may amass hundreds of thousands of video feeds in just a few years. Detroit has popularized plug-in surveillance networks through its controversial Project Green Light program. With Project Green Light, businesses can purchase CCTV cameras and connect them to police headquarters. They can also place a bright green light next to the cameras to indicate they are part of the police network. The project claims to deter crime by signaling to residents: The police are watching you. Detroit is not alone. Chicago, New Orleans, New York, and Atlanta have also deployed plug-in surveillance networks. In these cities, private businesses and/or homes provide feeds that are integrated into crime centers so that police can access live streams and recorded footage. The police department in New Haven, Connecticut, told me they are looking into plug-in surveillance, and others are likely considering it. The number of cameras on police networks now range from tens of thousands (Chicago) to several hundred (New Orleans). With so many cameras in place, and only a small team of officers to watch them, law enforcement agencies face a new challenge: How do you make sense of all that footage? Around 2006, a young Israeli woman was recording family videos every weekend, but as a student and parent, she didn\\u2019t have time to watch them. A computer scientist at her university, Professor Shmuel Peleg, told me he tried to create a solution for her: He would take a long video and condense the interesting activity into a short video clip. His solution failed: It only worked on stationary cameras, and the student\\u2019s video camera was moving when she filmed her family. Peleg soon found another use case in the surveillance industry, which relies on stationary cameras. His solution became BriefCam, a video analytics firm that can summarize video footage from a scene across time so that investigators can view all relevant footage in a short space of time.\\n\\nUsing a feature called Video Synopsis, BriefCam overlays footage of events happening at different times as if they are appearing simultaneously. For example, if several people walked past a camera at 12:30 p.m., 12:40 p.m., and 12:50 p.m., BriefCam will aggregate their images into a single scene. Investigators can view all footage of interest from a given day in minutes instead of hours. Thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence, summarization is just one feature in BriefCam\\u2019s product line and the rapidly expanding video analytics industry. Behavior recognition includes video analytics capabilities like fight detection, emotion recognition, fall detection, loitering, dog walking, jaywalking, toll fare evasion, and even lie detection. Object recognition can recognize faces, animals, cars, weapons, fires, and other things, as well as human characteristics like gender, age, and hair color. Anomalous or unusual behavior detection works by recording a fixed area for a period of time \\u2014 say, 30 days \\u2014 and determining \\u201cnormal\\u201d behavior for that scene. If the camera sees something unusual \\u2014 say, a person running down a street at 3:00 a.m. \\u2014 it will flag the incident for attention. Video analytics systems can analyze and search across real-time streams or recorded footage. They can also isolate individuals or objects as they traverse a smart camera network. Chicago; New Orleans; Detroit; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Hartford, Connecticut, are some of the cities currently using BriefCam for policing. With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. This provides authorities the power to index and search a vast database of objects, behaviors, and anomalous activity. In Connecticut, police have used video analytics to identify or monitor known or suspected drug dealers. Sergeant Johnmichael O\\u2019Hare, former Director of the Hartford Real-Time Crime Center, recently demonstrated how BriefCam helped Hartford police reveal \\u201cwhere people go the most\\u201d in the space of 24 hours by viewing footage condensed and summarized in just nine minutes. Using a feature called \\u201cpathways,\\u201d he discovered hundreds of people visiting just two houses on the street and secured a search warrant to verify that they were drug houses. Video analytics startup Voxel51 is also adding more sophisticated searching to the mix. Co-founded by Jason Corso, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, the company offers a platform for video processing and understanding. Corso told me his company hopes to offer the first system where people can \\u201csearch based on semantic content about their data, such as, \\u2018I want to find all the video clips that have more than 3-way intersections \\u2026 with at least 20 vehicles during daylight.\\u2019\\u201d Voxel51 \\u201ctries to make that possible\\u201d by taking video footage and \\u201cturning it into structured searchable data across different types of platforms.\\u201d Unlike BriefCam, which analyzes video using nothing but its own software, Voxel51 offers an open platform which allows third parties to add their own analytics models. If the platform succeeds, it will supercharge the ability to search and surveil public spaces. Corso told me his company is working on a pilot project with the Baltimore police for their CitiWatch surveillance program and plans to trial the software with the Houston Police Department. As cities start deploying a wide range of monitoring devices from the so-called internet of things, researchers are also developing a technique known as video analytics and sensor fusion, or VA/SF, for police intelligence. With VA/SF, multiple streams from sensors are combined with video analytics to reduce uncertainties and make inferences about complex situations. As one example, Peleg told me BriefCam is developing in-camera audio analytics that uses microphones to discern actions that may confuse AI systems, such as whether people are fighting or dancing. VMSs also offer smart integration across technologies. Former New Haven Chief of Police Anthony Campbell told me how ShotSpotters, controversial devices that listen for gunshots, integrate with specialized software so when a gun is fired, nearby swivel cameras instantly alter their direction to the location of the weapons discharge. Officers can also use software to lock building doors from a control center, and companies are developing analytics to alert security if one car is being followed by another. Video analytics captures a wide variety of data about the areas covered by smart camera networks. Not surprisingly, the information captured is now being proposed for predictive policing: the use of data to predict and police crime before it happens. In 2002, the dystopian film \\u201cMinority Report\\u201d depicted a society using \\u201cpre-crime\\u201d analytics for police to intervene in lawbreaking before it occurs. In the end, the officers in charge tried to manipulate the system for their own interests. A real-world version of \\u201cMinority Report\\u201d is emerging through real-time crime centers used to analyze crime patterns for police. In these centers, law enforcement agencies ingest information from sources like social media networks, data brokers, public databases, criminal records, and ShotSpotters. Weather data is even included for its impact on crime (because \\u201cbad guys don\\u2019t like to get wet\\u201d).

It begins with the proliferation of cameras for police and security, and ends with a powerful new industry imperative: complete visual surveillance of public space. In their first decades of existence, CCTV cameras were low-resolution analog devices that recorded onto tapes. Businesses or city authorities deployed them to film a small area of interest. Few cameras were placed in pubic, and the power to track people was limited: If police wanted to pursue a person of interest, they had to spend hours collecting footage by foot from nearby locations. In the late 1990s, video surveillance became more advanced. A company called Axis Communications invented the first internet-enabled surveillance camera, which converted moving images to digital data. New businesses like Milestone Systems built Video Management Systems, or VMS, to organize video information into databases. VMS providers created new features like motion sensor technology that alerted guards when a person was caught on camera in a restricted area. As time marched on, video surveillance spread. On one account, about 50 years ago, the United Kingdom had somewhere north of 60 permanent CCTV cameras installed nationwide. Today, the U.K. has over 6 million such devices, while the U.S. has tens of millions. According to marketing firm IHS Markit, 1 billion cameras will be watching the world by the end of 2021, with the United States rivaling China\\u2019s per person camera penetration rate. Police can now track people across multiple cameras from a command-and-control center, desktop, or smartphone. While it is possible to link thousands of cameras in a VMS, it is also expensive. To increase the amount of CCTVs available, cities recently came up with a clever hack: encouraging businesses and residents to place privately owned cameras on their police network \\u2014 what I call \\u201cplug-in surveillance networks.\\u201d\\n\\nBy pooling city-owned cameras with privately owned cameras, policing experts say an agency in a typical large city may amass hundreds of thousands of video feeds in just a few years. Detroit has popularized plug-in surveillance networks through its controversial Project Green Light program. With Project Green Light, businesses can purchase CCTV cameras and connect them to police headquarters. They can also place a bright green light next to the cameras to indicate they are part of the police network. The project claims to deter crime by signaling to residents: The police are watching you. Detroit is not alone. Chicago, New Orleans, New York, and Atlanta have also deployed plug-in surveillance networks. In these cities, private businesses and/or homes provide feeds that are integrated into crime centers so that police can access live streams and recorded footage. The police department in New Haven, Connecticut, told me they are looking into plug-in surveillance, and others are likely considering it. The number of cameras on police networks now range from tens of thousands (Chicago) to several hundred (New Orleans). With so many cameras in place, and only a small team of officers to watch them, law enforcement agencies face a new challenge: How do you make sense of all that footage? Around 2006, a young Israeli woman was recording family videos every weekend, but as a student and parent, she didn\\u2019t have time to watch them. A computer scientist at her university, Professor Shmuel Peleg, told me he tried to create a solution for her: He would take a long video and condense the interesting activity into a short video clip. His solution failed: It only worked on stationary cameras, and the student\\u2019s video camera was moving when she filmed her family. Peleg soon found another use case in the surveillance industry, which relies on stationary cameras. His solution became BriefCam, a video analytics firm that can summarize video footage from a scene across time so that investigators can view all relevant footage in a short space of time.\\n\\nUsing a feature called Video Synopsis, BriefCam overlays footage of events happening at different times as if they are appearing simultaneously. For example, if several people walked past a camera at 12:30 p.m., 12:40 p.m., and 12:50 p.m., BriefCam will aggregate their images into a single scene. Investigators can view all footage of interest from a given day in minutes instead of hours. Thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence, summarization is just one feature in BriefCam\\u2019s product line and the rapidly expanding video analytics industry. Behavior recognition includes video analytics capabilities like fight detection, emotion recognition, fall detection, loitering, dog walking, jaywalking, toll fare evasion, and even lie detection. Object recognition can recognize faces, animals, cars, weapons, fires, and other things, as well as human characteristics like gender, age, and hair color. Anomalous or unusual behavior detection works by recording a fixed area for a period of time \\u2014 say, 30 days \\u2014 and determining \\u201cnormal\\u201d behavior for that scene. If the camera sees something unusual \\u2014 say, a person running down a street at 3:00 a.m. \\u2014 it will flag the incident for attention. Video analytics systems can analyze and search across real-time streams or recorded footage. They can also isolate individuals or objects as they traverse a smart camera network. Chicago; New Orleans; Detroit; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Hartford, Connecticut, are some of the cities currently using BriefCam for policing. With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. This provides authorities the power to index and search a vast database of objects, behaviors, and anomalous activity. In Connecticut, police have used video analytics to identify or monitor known or suspected drug dealers. Sergeant Johnmichael O\\u2019Hare, former Director of the Hartford Real-Time Crime Center, recently demonstrated how BriefCam helped Hartford police reveal \\u201cwhere people go the most\\u201d in the space of 24 hours by viewing footage condensed and summarized in just nine minutes. Using a feature called \\u201cpathways,\\u201d he discovered hundreds of people visiting just two houses on the street and secured a search warrant to verify that they were drug houses. Video analytics startup Voxel51 is also adding more sophisticated searching to the mix. Co-founded by Jason Corso, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, the company offers a platform for video processing and understanding. Corso told me his company hopes to offer the first system where people can \\u201csearch based on semantic content about their data, such as, \\u2018I want to find all the video clips that have more than 3-way intersections \\u2026 with at least 20 vehicles during daylight.\\u2019\\u201d Voxel51 \\u201ctries to make that possible\\u201d by taking video footage and \\u201cturning it into structured searchable data across different types of platforms.\\u201d Unlike BriefCam, which analyzes video using nothing but its own software, Voxel51 offers an open platform which allows third parties to add their own analytics models. If the platform succeeds, it will supercharge the ability to search and surveil public spaces. Corso told me his company is working on a pilot project with the Baltimore police for their CitiWatch surveillance program and plans to trial the software with the Houston Police Department. As cities start deploying a wide range of monitoring devices from the so-called internet of things, researchers are also developing a technique known as video analytics and sensor fusion, or VA/SF, for police intelligence. With VA/SF, multiple streams from sensors are combined with video analytics to reduce uncertainties and make inferences about complex situations. As one example, Peleg told me BriefCam is developing in-camera audio analytics that uses microphones to discern actions that may confuse AI systems, such as whether people are fighting or dancing. VMSs also offer smart integration across technologies. Former New Haven Chief of Police Anthony Campbell told me how ShotSpotters, controversial devices that listen for gunshots, integrate with specialized software so when a gun is fired, nearby swivel cameras instantly alter their direction to the location of the weapons discharge. Officers can also use software to lock building doors from a control center, and companies are developing analytics to alert security if one car is being followed by another. Video analytics captures a wide variety of data about the areas covered by smart camera networks. Not surprisingly, the information captured is now being proposed for predictive policing: the use of data to predict and police crime before it happens. In 2002, the dystopian film \\u201cMinority Report\\u201d depicted a society using \\u201cpre-crime\\u201d analytics for police to intervene in lawbreaking before it occurs. In the end, the officers in charge tried to manipulate the system for their own interests. A real-world version of \\u201cMinority Report\\u201d is emerging through real-time crime centers used to analyze crime patterns for police. In these centers, law enforcement agencies ingest information from sources like social media networks, data brokers, public databases, criminal records, and ShotSpotters. Weather data is even included for its impact on crime (because \\u201cbad guys don\\u2019t like to get wet\\u201d). In a 2018 document, the data storage firm Western Digital and the consultancy Accenture predicted mass smart camera networks would be deployed \\u201cacross three tiers of maturity.\\u201d This multi-stage adoption, they contended, would \\u201callow society\\u201d to gradually abandon \\u201cconcerns about privacy\\u201d and instead \\u201caccept and advocate\\u201d for mass police and government surveillance in the interest of \\u201cpublic safety.\\u201d Tier 1 encompasses the present where police use CCTV networks to investigate crimes after-the-fact. By 2025, society will reach Tier 2 as municipalities transform into \\u201csmart\\u201d cities, the document said. Businesses and public institutions, like schools and hospitals, will plug camera feeds into government and law enforcement agencies to inform centralized, AI-enabled analytics systems. Tier 3, the most predictive-oriented surveillance system, will arrive by 2035. Some residents will voluntarily donate their camera feeds, while others will be \\u201cencouraged to do so by tax-break incentives or nominal compensation.\\u201d A \\u201cpublic safety ecosystem\\u201d will centralize data \\u201cpulled from disparate databases such as social media, driver\\u2019s licenses, police databases, and dark data.\\u201d An AI-enabled analytics unit will let police assess \\u201canomalies in real time and interrupt a crime before it is committed.\\u201d That is to say, to catch pre-crime. While CCTV surveillance began as a simple tool for criminal justice, it has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry that covers multiple industry verticals. From policing and smart cities to schools, health care facilities, and retail, society is moving toward near-complete visual surveillance of commercial and urban spaces. Denmark-based Milestone Systems, a top VMS provider with half its revenues in the U.S., had less than 10 employees in 1999. Today they are a major corporation that claims offices in over 20 countries. Axis Communications used to be a network printer outfit. They have since become a leading camera provider pushing over $1 billion in sales per year. BriefCam began as a university project. Now it is among the world\\u2019s top video analytics providers, with clients, it says, spanning over 40 countries. Over the past six years, Canon purchased all three, giving the imaging conglomerate ownership of industry giants in video management software, CCTV cameras, and video analytics. Motorola recently acquired a top VMS provider, Avigilon, for $1 billion. In turn, Avigilon and other large firms have purchased their own companies.\\n\\nFamiliar big tech giants are also in on the action. Lieutenant Patrick O\\u2019Donnell of the Chicago police force told me his department is working on a non-disclosure agreement with Google for a video analytics pilot project to detect people reacting to gunfire, and if they are in the prone position, so the police can receive real-time alerts. (Google did not respond to a request for comment.) Video monitoring networks inevitably entangle and implicate a whole ecosystem of vendors, some of whom have offered, or may yet offer, services specifically targeted at such systems. Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Comcast, Verizon, and Cisco are among those enabling the networks with technologies like cloud services, broadband connectivity, or video surveillance software. In the public sector, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is funding \\u201cpublic analytics\\u201d and communications networks like the First Responder Network Authority, or FirstNet, for real-time video and other surveillance technologies. FirstNet will cost $46.5 billion, and is being built by AT&T. Voxel51 is another NIST-backed venture. The public is thus paying for their own high-tech surveillance three times over: first, through taxes for university research; second, through grant money for the formation of a for-profit startup (Voxel51); and third, through the purchase of Voxel51\\u2019s services by city police departments using public funds. With the private and public sector looking to expand the presence of cameras, video surveillance has become a new cash cow. As Corso put it, \\u201cthere will be something like 45 billion cameras in the world within a few decades. That\\u2019s a lot of (video) pixels. For the most part, most of those pixels go unused.\\u201d Corso\\u2019s estimate mirrors a 2017 forecast from New York venture capital firm LDV, which believes smartphones will evolve to have even more cameras than they do today, contributing to the growth. Companies that began with markets for police and security are now diversifying their offerings to the commercial sector. BriefCam, Milestone, and Axis advertise the use of video analytics for retailers, where they can monitor foot traffic, queue length, shopping patterns, floor layouts, and conduct A/B testing. Voxel51 has an option built for the fashion industry and plans to expand across industry verticals. Motionloft offers analytics for smart cities, retailers, commercial real estate, and entertainment venues. Other examples abound. Public and private sector actors are pressing for a world full of smart video surveillance. Peleg, for example, told me of a use case for smart cities: If you drive into the city, you could \\u201cjust park and go home\\u201d without using a parking meter. The city would send a bill to your house at the end of the month. \\u201cOf course, you lose your privacy,\\u201d he added. \\u201cThe question is, do you really care about Big Brother knows where you are, what you do, etc.? Some people may not like it.\\u201d How to Rein in Smart Surveillance Those who do not like new forms of Big Brother surveillance are presently fixated on facial recognition. Yet they have largely ignored the shift to smart camera networks \\u2014 and the industrial complex driving it. Thousands of cameras are now set to scrutinize our every move, informing city authorities whether we are walking, running, riding a bike, or doing anything \\u201csuspicious.\\u201d With video analytics, artificial intelligence is used to identify our sex, age, and type of clothes, and could potentially be used to categorize us by race or religious attire. Such surveillance could have a severe chilling effect on our freedom of expression and association. Is this the world we want to live in? The capacity to track individuals across smart CCTV networks can be used to target marginalized communities. The detection of \\u201cloitering\\u201d or \\u201cshoplifting\\u201d by cameras concentrated in poor neighborhoods may deepen racial bias in policing practices. This kind of racial discrimination is already happening in South Africa, where \\u201cunusual behavior detection\\u201d has been deployed by smart camera networks for several years. In the United States, smart camera networks are just emerging, and there is little information or transparency about their use. Nevertheless, we know surveillance has been used throughout history to target oppressed groups. In recent years, the New York Police Department secretly spied on Muslims, the FBI used surveillance aircraft to monitor Black Lives Matter protesters, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection began building a high-tech video surveillance \\u201csmart border\\u201d across the Tohono O\\u2019odham reservation in Arizona. Law enforcement agencies claim smart camera networks will reduce crime, but at what cost? If a camera could be put in every room in every house, domestic violence might go down. We could add automated \\u201cfilters\\u201d that only record when a loud noise is detected, or when someone grabs a knife. Should police put smart cameras inside every living room? The commercial sector is likewise rationalizing the advance of surveillance capitalism into the physical domain. Retailers, employers, and investors want to put us all under smart video surveillance so they can manage us with visual \\u201cintelligence.\\u201d When asked about privacy, several major police departments told me they have the right to see and record everything you do as soon as you leave your home. Retailers, in turn, won\\u2019t even approach public disclosure: They are keeping their video analytics practices secret. In the United States, there is generally no \\u201creasonable expectation\\u201d of privacy in public. The Fourth Amendment encompasses the home and a few public areas we \\u201creasonably\\u201d expect to be private, such as a phone booth. Almost everything else \\u2014 our streets, our stores, our schools \\u2014 is fair game. Even if rules are updated to restrict the use of video surveillance, we cannot guarantee those rules will remain in place. With thousands of high-res cameras networked together, a dystopian surveillance state is a mouse click away. By installing cameras everywhere, we are opening a Pandora\\u2019s box. To address the privacy threats of smart camera networks, legislators should ban plug-in surveillance networks and restrict the scope of networked CCTVs beyond the premise of a single site. They should also limit the density of camera and sensor coverage in public. These measures would block the capacity to track people across wide areas and prevent the phenomenon of constantly being watched. The government should also ban video surveillance analytics in publicly accessible spaces, perhaps with exceptions for rare cases such as the detection of bodies on train tracks. Such a ban would disincentivize mass camera deployments because video analytics is needed to analyze large volumes of footage. Courts should urgently reconsider the scope of the Fourth Amendment and expand our right to privacy in public. Police departments, vendors, and researchers need to disclose and publicize their projects, and engage with academics, journalists, and civil society. It is clear we have a crisis in the works. We need to move beyond the limited conversation of facial recognition and address the broader world of video surveillance, before it is too late.\", \"author\": \"Michael Kwet\", \"url\": \"https://theintercept.com/2020/01/27/surveillance-cctv-smart-camera-networks/\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 17:53:01 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580165581, \"collection_utc\": 1580170790}",News,1580165581

The public is thus paying for their own high-tech surveillance three times over: first, through taxes for university research; second, through grant money for the formation of a for-profit startup (Voxel51); and third, through the purchase of Voxel51\\u2019s services by city police departments using public funds. With the private and public sector looking to expand the presence of cameras, video surveillance has become a new cash cow. As Corso put it, \\u201cthere will be something like 45 billion cameras in the world within a few decades. That\\u2019s a lot of (video) pixels. For the most part, most of those pixels go unused.\\u201d Corso\\u2019s estimate mirrors a 2017 forecast from New York venture capital firm LDV, which believes smartphones will evolve to have even more cameras than they do today, contributing to the growth. Companies that began with markets for police and security are now diversifying their offerings to the commercial sector. BriefCam, Milestone, and Axis advertise the use of video analytics for retailers, where they can monitor foot traffic, queue length, shopping patterns, floor layouts, and conduct A/B testing. Voxel51 has an option built for the fashion industry and plans to expand across industry verticals. Motionloft offers analytics for smart cities, retailers, commercial real estate, and entertainment venues. Other examples abound. Public and private sector actors are pressing for a world full of smart video surveillance. Peleg, for example, told me of a use case for smart cities: If you drive into the city, you could \\u201cjust park and go home\\u201d without using a parking meter. The city would send a bill to your house at the end of the month. \\u201cOf course, you lose your privacy,\\u201d he added. \\u201cThe question is, do you really care about Big Brother knows where you are, what you do, etc.? Some people may not like it.\\u201d How to Rein in Smart Surveillance Those who do not like new forms of Big Brother surveillance are presently fixated on facial recognition. Yet they have largely ignored the shift to smart camera networks \\u2014 and the industrial complex driving it. Thousands of cameras are now set to scrutinize our every move, informing city authorities whether we are walking, running, riding a bike, or doing anything \\u201csuspicious.\\u201d With video analytics, artificial intelligence is used to identify our sex, age, and type of clothes, and could potentially be used to categorize us by race or religious attire. Such surveillance could have a severe chilling effect on our freedom of expression and association. Is this the world we want to live in? The capacity to track individuals across smart CCTV networks can be used to target marginalized communities. The detection of \\u201cloitering\\u201d or \\u201cshoplifting\\u201d by cameras concentrated in poor neighborhoods may deepen racial bias in policing practices. This kind of racial discrimination is already happening in South Africa, where \\u201cunusual behavior detection\\u201d has been deployed by smart camera networks for several years. In the United States, smart camera networks are just emerging, and there is little information or transparency about their use. Nevertheless, we know surveillance has been used throughout history to target oppressed groups. In recent years, the New York Police Department secretly spied on Muslims, the FBI used surveillance aircraft to monitor Black Lives Matter protesters, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection began building a high-tech video surveillance \\u201csmart border\\u201d across the Tohono O\\u2019odham reservation in Arizona. Law enforcement agencies claim smart camera networks will reduce crime, but at what cost? If a camera could be put in every room in every house, domestic violence might go down. We could add automated \\u201cfilters\\u201d that only record when a loud noise is detected, or when someone grabs a knife. Should police put smart cameras inside every living room? The commercial sector is likewise rationalizing the advance of surveillance capitalism into the physical domain. Retailers, employers, and investors want to put us all under smart video surveillance so they can manage us with visual \\u201cintelligence.\\u201d When asked about privacy, several major police departments told me they have the right to see and record everything you do as soon as you leave your home. Retailers, in turn, won\\u2019t even approach public disclosure: They are keeping their video analytics practices secret. In the United States, there is generally no \\u201creasonable expectation\\u201d of privacy in public. The Fourth Amendment encompasses the home and a few public areas we \\u201creasonably\\u201d expect to be private, such as a phone booth. Almost everything else \\u2014 our streets, our stores, our schools \\u2014 is fair game. Even if rules are updated to restrict the use of video surveillance, we cannot guarantee those rules will remain in place. With thousands of high-res cameras networked together, a dystopian surveillance state is a mouse click away. By installing cameras everywhere, we are opening a Pandora\\u2019s box. To address the privacy threats of smart camera networks, legislators should ban plug-in surveillance networks and restrict the scope of networked CCTVs beyond the premise of a single site. They should also limit the density of camera and sensor coverage in public. These measures would block the capacity to track people across wide areas and prevent the phenomenon of constantly being watched. The government should also ban video surveillance analytics in publicly accessible spaces, perhaps with exceptions for rare cases such as the detection of bodies on train tracks. Such a ban would disincentivize mass camera deployments because video analytics is needed to analyze large volumes of footage. Courts should urgently reconsider the scope of the Fourth Amendment and expand our right to privacy in public. Police departments, vendors, and researchers need to disclose and publicize their projects, and engage with academics, journalists, and civil society. It is clear we have a crisis in the works. We need to move beyond the limited conversation of facial recognition and address the broader world of video surveillance, before it is too late.\", \"author\": \"Michael Kwet\", \"url\": \"https://theintercept.com/2020/01/27/surveillance-cctv-smart-camera-networks/\", \"published\": \"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 17:53:01 +0000\", \"published_utc\": 1580165581, \"collection_utc\": 1580170790}",News,1580165581
