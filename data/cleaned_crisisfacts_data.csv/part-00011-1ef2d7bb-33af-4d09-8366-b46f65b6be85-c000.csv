It's been almost a month... dang. Anyway, sorry for the huge delay, still coming out of the seasonal depression as well as coming to terms with personal things in life. I don't want to dwell into it but let's say life hit me in the face. But anyway, I'm finally enjoying writing a lot more and I hope to speed up my uploads.\\n\\n/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/\\n\\n\\u201cLouis\\u2026 really?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYeah, why not? Looks cool.\\u201d\\n\\nCella scratched her chin, a behavior she picked up from the humans over the months. She considered the proposal. \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure. I really wouldn\\u2019t like our vacation plans to be derailed by this.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou got plans?\\u201d Louis asked.\\n\\n\\u201cYou don\\u2019t?\\u201d\\n\\nHe shrugged. \\u201cNothing, just some ideas here and there, places I\\u2019d like to visit, things I\\u2019d like to do. I don\\u2019t have the two months locked in by any means.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWell, I planned on visiting my family. I don\\u2019t know how long it\\u2019ll be; it looks like it\\u2019s going to be just two weeks, but still. I\\u2019d hate this getting in the way.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt won\\u2019t be. The competition is 5 months away, vacation starts in a month and its two months long. There is plenty of time.\\u201d\\u00a0\\n\\nShe kept looking at the picture of the poster, unconvinced. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll talk about it with the others, I assume you want to do this with the usual group?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYeah.\\u201d\\n\\nCella fell silent for a second, thinking about it. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll see,\\u201d she finally said, giving back Louis\\u2019 phone.\\n\\nLouis took it. \\u201cI just think we could use some more excitement; you know?\\u201d He said as he sat on the couch in the middle of his dorm.\\u00a0\\n\\nCella joined him, dropping alongside. \\u201cIt hasn\\u2019t been boring. We met all the others, we saw all the drama unfold with the professor changes and the firings, we hang out regularly, play videogames....\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut all of that has been over the course of months and it\\u2019s become routine. I mean, it\\u2019s fine, I\\u2019m not complaining. But I wouldn\\u2019t write a book about it, you know?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYeah, I get it. You are a species of action.\\u201d\\n\\nLouis laughed. \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure we deserve that much credit, but I personally am. I\\u2019m really looking forward to getting my hands dirty again, I\\u2019ll probably start brainstorming tomorrow.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHmm\\u2026 Well, I hope my man of action already finished the safety in manufacturing report, otherwise you may have a little problem with that,\\u201d she stated.\\n\\nLouis threw his back, stared at the ceiling, and growled. \\u201cFuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.\\u201d\\n\\nCella laughed, her scales flashing yellow. \\u201cDon\\u2019t laugh at me!\\u201d He said jokingly, only making her laugh harder.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re unbelievable,\\u201d she told him. Her scales continuing to flash.\\n\\nLouis sat back quietly, looking at Cella flash yellow. Her scales kept flashing. And flashing. And flashing. He tried to ignore her, but he was never able to kick the smile out of his face.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u201cJesus, stop with the disco, your scales are going to burn out,\\u201d he joked.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s not my fault that you\\u2019re comedic timing personified!\\u201d she defended herself.\\n\\n\\u201cPsh, whatever.\\u201d\\u00a0\\n\\nHer laugher died down as she remembered her own responsibilities. \\u201cWell, as much as I\\u2019d like to stay and hang out, I haven\\u2019t finished that report either and I\\u2019d really prefer to get it done today. So, I guess I\\u2019ll go do that,\\u201d she explained, standing up.\\n\\n\\u201cOh well, see you tomorrow then.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSee you.\\u201d\\n\\nCella left the room after a quick goodbye hug, stumbling upon Walter just before she closed the door. \\u201cOh, hey Cella, you leaving?\\u201d Walter asked, putting away the dorm key back into his pocket.\\n\\n\\u201cHi, yes, got work to do.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt do be like that sometimes. Aight, have a good day.\\u201d\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u201cLikewise, thanks.\\u201d\\n\\nWalter smiled and both parted ways, each going to their own dorms.\\n\\nWalter saw Louis on the couch, \\u201cHey,\\u201d he greeted.\\n\\n\\u201cHey. Where were you?\\u201d\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u201cJust playing some music,\\u201d he said, raising his guitar case. \\u201cAnd you?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI was just talking with Cella,\\u201d he said, standing up.\\n\\nWalter headed for the kitchenette. \\u201cNeat. I\\u2019m going to make myself some lunch, do you want something?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo thanks. But I\\u2019d like some speed right now.\\u201d Louis replied, entering the dorms.\\n\\n\\u201cWe are all out of needles, I\\u2019m afraid.\\u201d\\n\\nLouis came back, his simracing wheel on hand. \\u201cNot that kind of speed, dumbass.\\u201d  \\nWalter chuckled and went back to his lunch.  \\n\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~  \\nMeanwhile, two buildings over, Gendeles was wandering around his dorm talking over the phone with Fghn, a good friend of his.

There is zero opposing the Patriot Act and its secret laws and courts in his agenda.  In fact, he wants to expand the use of terrorism laws against Americans.  He proposes the beginnings of an authoritarian social credit system.
